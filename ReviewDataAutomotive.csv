1-star,0,chris is a very rude person. gave me an attitude about him not having change. some people should not go to work if there in a grumpy mood. it shows
5-star,1,one of my favorite gas station to stop at. the store is always clean and the staff is friendly. this location is convenient and has a red box outside the store. the have hot and ready to serve pizza and wings as well. one thing i love about this gas station i can't even recall a time where someone has come up to me and asked for money which is definitely a plus. the pumps are always clean and the parking lot is always kept up. i can say i actually look forward to stopping here and filling up with petro!
3-star,0,"oh thank heaven for seven eleven! i don't know about that, but i thank seven eleven for instant brand recognition. convenience stores are a dime a dozen. but seven eleven stands out from the competition with its famous brands that include the big gulp, slurpee, big bite hot dog, seven eleven nachos, and seven eleven coffee. it's not the above seven eleven brands that draw me into this location. it is the seven eleven gasoline. when i drive from green valley toward the northwest bound 95 or northeast valley with a low tank of gas, oftentimes i stop here. i appreciate that there is sufficient room to maneuver a vehicle around the gas pump islands. i appreciate that seven eleven takes graffiti seriously. disparate from several of the valleys gas stations, the pumps are free of the graffiti that is commonly carved into the gas pumps. i also appreciate how this seven eleven spruced up a blighted corner. i take it back, i also appreciate the big gulp, that i pick up for the drive north. you might ask, ""how is seven eleven gasoline?"" seven eleven gasoline is one of the brands that i have been using with my last three car leases. i have been fueling my motor vehicles with seven eleven gasoline, and never had an engine problem. in the exact style of many seven elevens, this location is clean and modern. even though it takes me a few minutes to pay and fill up my motor vehicle, it is a short period of time well spent. and in a short period of time i shall return to this seven eleven."
5-star,1,"five stars because of the guy who works weekday mornings (around 8-9am-ish.) he is awesome, friendly, fast service, patient when i'm paying with half card, change and pocket lint! i observe he treats all customers well. i'm fond of the tall, super-early morning guy as well. this is my favorite 7-11. it is also very clean."
5-star,1,i had the best experience here!!!!!! all the employees are very nice and helpful..... i will definitely return with any and all my vehicles needs......
1-star,0,"my objective with this shop was to find a good, and fast oil change place that won't upsell. unfortunately, i failed miserably at that. here's why:1) it took 40 minutes to do an oil change at 8am opening, no lines. 2) the service manager used bait and switch tactics on me. 3) he used fear tactics to try and get me to do an expensive $1580 repair. 4) this shop didn't really want to honor the $10 oil change coupons they sent out. i would suggest that they try and build trust and loyalty with the community instead of scams. needless to say, i won't be coming back and i can't wait to own a tesla so i don't have to deal with shops like these anymore. i'll have to look for another oil change place for my next time. i wished vegas had honest and quick shops like the oilmen in los angeles where i moved from. here's the timeline of events that transpired for me: got there at 8:03. service manager greeted with a smile. i presented with the $9.99 coupon for oil change. his face changed immediately from welcoming to disappointment. he tried bait and switch, telling me my hybrid requires full synthetic and that i couldn't use the oil on the $10 coupon. i said no, i like the regular stuff. he hesitantly told me to go check in with the clerk, they will use the regular oil as i requested on my car. i checked in. a few minutes later the technician brought the car up on the lift. he began draining the oil. my car was left alone for a while. then the service manager did his inspection, then came to me and said my suspension shocks were at the end of its life. replacement was $1580. he used scare tactics, such as your car has high miles with 170k miles, and they were supposed to only last 70k. i refused my car drives just fine. he said i needed new engine air filter for $24.99. i waited a bit before answering, his face was hopeful. he asked if i want it, i said no, then he just walked away with a mad-disappointed face. sorry, but i can change my own air filters, which i have at home. the technician took another 10 minutes to change the oil filter, and then put in the oil. my car was done. i went into the clerk's office and waited 10 minutes before i was able to pay. though i won't blame her for the slow service she was on the phone with another customer. all in all, i got there at 8:03am, i was finally able to get out at 8:45am. i did stand by my car the whole time to watch them and i inspected my car afterwards. i've seen some bad shop videos on youtube."
1-star,0,"absolute worst service ever. went in for oil change and was charged $10 more than advertised rate. did not top off fluids like they advertised they would. also tried to up-sell me on everything imaginable. told me my brakes were bad even though i had just had them serviced at the dealership 6 months ago. told me that i would never pass smog test because my filters were so bad, just passed yesterday with flying colors. would not recommend this place to anyone. steer clear!!"
5-star,1,love love love their customer service. i come here regularly for tune ups and always leave satisfied. lena in the front always takes care of me and one of the managers always greets me with a smile. i come to this location the most but have also been to others. pretty consistent service all around.
1-star,0,"i took my friend to this shop to get her oil changed. she said they had a deal going for a $10 oil change with tire rotation. they asked what kind of oil she usually puts in the car. she says either full synthetic or synthetic blend. they then proceed to tell us that you should never go back to anything else once you put full synthetic oil in the engine (which is a huge myth/lie, he must have assumed i didn't know anything about cars because he insisted on trying to convince me to go full synthetic) i told them we'll just do the synthetic blend. they agree, take the car in the garage for about 20-30 mins and come back in to tell us that her car doesn't take synthetic blend oil and we would have to pay for full synthetic. i laughed and asked for the keys back. auto shops like this try to take advantage of people everyday. be smart and don't ever take your car to this place."
1-star,0,this place is a joke !!! byron the store manager is a straight fraud what a piece of shit !! i know for a fact he has been ripping off anyone that doesn't no better about cars young girls especially !! i don't recommend this place to anyone i wouldn't let them put air in my tire because this is for sure the type of place that breaks things on purpose so they can make more money !! the young girl that just came to your store this last week she had a bad hose to the radiator and a missing gas cap they charged her 150 dollars for that !! then 3 days later her gage is saying over heat!!!! just perfect !! so she's brings it back and low in behold that same hose connecting to the radiator a little piece where the hose connects to that they just replaced is cracked and broken !! so now these idiots tell her she needs new radiator and they want another 500 bucks !!!! fucking scum bags please never go to this idiot be smart do your research . by the way i talked to this young girl and she go the radiator and the whole thing done for a 140 bucks . see ya assholes never !!!!
1-star,0,"came in yesterday september 13th for a oil change on my 2007 audi. today, september 14th i got to the car wash and the attendants tell me my front underbody came off. they pulled it out and told me who ever was underneath lost my screws and just tucked the thing into my front bumper. i am happy this didn't happen on the freeway."

5-star,1,"napa autocare center located at 6765 w flamingo rd. is the absolute best! having just failed my smog inspection, i knew i needed professionals. i had received a ""grand opening"" flyer in the mail, so i drove over immediately. i was damned lucky to find this new auto care location. i was met at the counter by byron and ernie, who extended professionalism and courtesy while explaining what i needed to pass smog inspection. their tech, rob performed the needed repairs quickly and expertly, and then informed me on exactly what he'd done to my vehicle. the smog check tech, chris was equally informative, helpful, and professional. they even gave me a discount for being an air force veteran...how cool (and unusual) is that?!! finally, i've found the best place in las vegas to take care of my annual smog check, as well as oil changes and tires. they will be my number one recommendation to anyone needing expert auto care at a reasonable price! many thanks to byron, ernie, rob, and chris - you guys are the best!"
1-star,0,"took my car for a simple brake shoes change. everything was perfectly fine, but after they changed it, the abs and traction control light was on. and they never adjusted the e-brake, so it had no grip. i went back to the shop to complain, they said they will adjust the e-brake, but they will not take responsibility for the traction control light, since they said it was just a total ""coincidence"" that it 'just happened to activate' after they changed the brake shoes. yeah.. total ""coincidence."" i obviously felt the bs so i went back to the shop for a 3rd time and had it checked via obd2. it turns out, it was the rear wheel abs speed sensor. which just happens to be 2 inches from the brakes. the manager still wouldn't accept fault. he kept saying it was a total coincidence, and that they never touched the sensor, which just happens to be at the back of the brakes... that they changed. that it was just a ""total coincidence"" that the sensor broke 'coincidentally' after theyve replaced the shoes. i've got no more energy left to go back there a 4th time and get stuffed with bs after bs excuses. for $160, i thought i was getting a professional service. i will eat the cost of the new sensor and change it myself. lesson learned. never again."
5-star,1,these guys know how to do it right. up on the lift under five minutes. i knew i had a leak (probably just a pan gasket) and they brought it to my attention. no sales pressure at all. great price also.
5-star,1,"came in for a smog... waited for a bit for when it was my turn they told me i had to wait for about 15-20 more mins because they needed to go get something for the smog machine. who i assume is the manager noticed i had been waiting for a while now came up to me to tell me he was going to take care of the smog for me. when they do something w/o you asking, that's what i call great customer service. if i ever need to i will come back here"
5-star,1,stopped in today after going to discount tire twice with a tire that i was told could not be patched up. my roommate suggested that i go to my mechanic of course aa auto care and they patched up the tire no problem it works great thank you
1-star,0,"warning!!! do not use this company for any purpose!!! aa auto care - previously purrfect auto - name changed i would guess because of poor service, bad reviews and horrible management to name but a few things that i have experienced. now aa auto care. well nothing changed but the name and a few of the employees (including some management). in all due respect, the workers there were friendly. even the owner, who i talked to several times about my issues gave me the impression he wanted to do the right thing by me - yet the management wouldn't. this leads me to believe it was all lip service! it is important that you know... this business under both names lied to me, to date fail to follow up and satisfy the work i overpaid for even under warrantee they refuse to do the proper work. explain: i negotiated to have a rebuilt motor put in my car. they quoted me one price and charged me over $700 more. out of desperation and the fact that without consulting me first they put the engine they claimed was rebuilt in the car. this took months to fulfil so i was very ready and in need of my car. it only gets worse.... during the subsequent year i have fought with aa auto et al about this issue, the car has never operated properly, has all kinds of new issues, i've discovered that the engine is a used engine with many miles on it, leaks oil, has a bad noise, also discovered that my original transmission was stolen and replaced with one from u pull it (still has the markings on it from that business). also during one of the many times they held my car for weeks on end, my tool box with tools that were given to me by my dad who is now dead was stolen from my car. after much patience on my part and mere lip service and poor workmanship on theirs, the car still does not run and they have refused to honor the warranty yet told me i was ""too demanding"" when i wanted the car to run properly. i was event threatened by the man who i was told was there to 'handle complaints.' he basically attempted to get me to fight him at one of their locations on craig road. yes, i have witnesses... this is the most frustrating of all things! i don't know what to do other than to contact an attorney (which i am in the process of giving all the paperwork and records i've keep) and now to write a warning to anyone who is thinking about doing work with this company. warning i have personally witnessed aa auto sell services that were not needed to people who came in while i was waiting there. i heard the conversations before and after such sales and it is pure thievery what they do. in conclusion: horrible workmanship, theft of parts and personal items, failure to honor warranty, and threats of physical harm when confronting them about what they promised they would do!"
4-star,1,stopped in today for an estimate for replacing sensors - estimate is approximately 743 - nathan was very knowledgeable and friendly - i hope the reviews that were negative are not true and that i am not going to be ripped off because i am a woman - i hope they are honest
1-star,0,"this place was great when it was puurfect auto, but now this place is nothing but a ripoff. don't come in here thinking your going to just get what you want repaired and that's it. i went to discount tires because i recently got my tires replaced there and was hearing a noise thinking maybe a tire is loose, but they show me that the tire is literally wiggling with just moving it with their hands. they tell me that my hub bearing is loose, to go back to your mechanic since i got my hub bearing recently replaced again in the beginning of the year, so clearly the work wasn't done right. take it to aa auto and explain the problem, instead of even putting on the rack he takes the opinion from the mechanic that supposedly replaced it right. with the mechanics opinion he comes back saying the car needs to be diagnosed instead of just checking out what is asked. i understood that my hub bearing was not in warranty but they could of atleast of checked it out without all the extra fees they wanted to add. do not take your car here, you won't walk out with a simple fix. they always try to add stuff to fix even on oil changes but i have gotten second opinions and what they say is wrong is just fine. aa auto care don't contact me and harass me, my business with you is done. i will be going to puurfect auto on fort apache for an honest work."
1-star,0,"ladies and gentlemen beware. mainly my ladies out there!! crooks. dirty crooks. they tried to charge me $1600 for a ""brand new"" power steering pump, knowing that i was desperate. they told me they found a used after market part, everything plus labor would come out to around $950. sounded good to me, as i do not know sh*t about cars, hence these crooks could sense that. my boyfriend felt something was wrong with the price and asked me to call the mazda dealership and to google the part. when i googled the exact part, online its only $356. mazda dealership said the part brand new with warranty was $750. archie why would you lie to me over the phone and tell me the part brand new from dealership was 2x that? thats so wrong man. you're a crook for that. honesty and fairness are not in these crooks vocabulary. george and archie appear to be nice and very knowledgeable but do not let that fool you. these guys are very pushy and relentless. the shop is too thirsty for your hard earned pennies. wolves in sheeps clothing. this auto shop preys on women. they salivate when females walk through the door because all they see is $$$ signs. sad world. sorry people. ps. later that evening i received a text from one of the crooks and they apologized for the situation and they stated they had spoke to their supervisor and they would fix my power steering pump for $500 out the door part and labor. interesting when the first price i was quoted was 3x that amount. psh they can save that for the birds. shady business y'all, check your gut, check your sources before resorting to these hooligans."
5-star,1,the customer service guy george is amazing. very impressed with the pricing i recommend this place 100% and being a female we all think we are easy targets to being ripped off this place really does care.... my bmw 650i is back on the road no more oil leaks and shaking i'm back on the roads safely. thank you aa auto team
5-star,1,"this location has one of the best service i have seen. was treated with great respect. i was expecting to pay over $90.00 for my full syn oil but came to find out it was on sale for $49.99,... amazing. thanks aa auto"
1-star,0,"took car for oil change. i let them know that i had my car serviced some place else before that did a poor job, and that i ran a full service station years ago. they bragged that they would check car to see if it needed anything else. they said it needed fuel injectors cleaned and 120,000 mile maintence. i had injectors cleaned about 9 months ago and my car only has 101500 miles on it, so it does not need those items done anytime soon.. i knew i needed windsheild wipers, but they never mentioned them. my power steering pump also has a slow leak (need to add fluid every 5 to 6 months), and they did not mention that either. the leak on it can be seen right beside the cap for filling the oil, so i dont know how they missed telling me it wawas leaking. also their oil change coupon mentions that it includes free tire rotation, which the car needed, but they did not do it. it also mentions that they will top off fluids, which the car needed power steering fluid, but they did not do.they do not do what is advertised or what they say. i wil not go back there and will be sure to let everyone who is looking for car repair to stay away. surprisingly the oil was changed, but dont know about the filter. i just hope they put the correct oil in my type of car. found oil on radiator resevior and cap, have no idea why, since the oil fill cap is on opposite side of engine compartment. i also found one of their red shop rags under the hood. my mileage indicator had also been reset, which irritates me also, since i use it to keep track of miles between fillups and there was no reason for them to mess with it. my trunk was also unlocked by them, which makes me wonder if they were looking for something in there. or maybe they didnt know where the engine was in a bmw. stay away from this place, for your own peace of mind. only thing i can say good about them, is that they are friendly. i hope all the people that give them rave reviews double check the work these guys did."
5-star,1,"this is one of the best services i've ever received. good pricing too! all the employees were really helpful and they clearly explained the issue with my mustang. i'd recommend them to anyone looking for fast, reliable, and caring service."
5-star,1,"prior to my visit to sun auto service, i called several auto repair shops for a quote on work to be done. quotes ranged as high as $495. sun auto service came in at $170 and their work fixed the problem. store manager wes russell knows how to provide good service to his customers and is a real credit to the store. no frills just professional service at an honest price. good coffee, tv and reading material or you can walk next door to trader joes for a snack."
5-star,1,very friendly and knowledgeable mechanics. they worked with me and helped me out. they went out of their way to make me a satisfied customer. great work on my cars. thanks!
1-star,0,pushy to the point where the mechanic wouldn't listen when i told him no to the extra crap he wanted to do in addition to an oil change. i ended up accepting because i didn't want to spend any more time arguing with the guy. will never return. i've been to jiffy lubes more reputable than this place. edit: they also would not stop calling me to talk about the review i posted. avoid this place.
1-star,0,make sure you get copies of all your paperwork. get everything in writing. what they tell you at the washington location and what they do are very different. they do not honor their own warranty the district manager does not return phone calls. no accountability. if i could give a negative resting i would thank you fadi for your response. but i continued to use the washington location and had a serious problem. when i tried to reach an area manager. i was either given the wrong number or never received a response. i had been a loyal customer for 6+ years. you have lost my business and recommendation
1-star,0,"so i bring my truck in and request a tune up... they hook up the diagnostics and it reads a misfire in cylinder 1.. the manager thomas looks under my hood and tells me it's the spider injector going bad, hes not even going to sell me a tune up because itll do no good and most places charge $800-$900 for the repair but he'll do it for $700... the next day i go in and explain i don't have $700 and this is an urgent issue. he seemed so friendly and willing to help, and i was naive. so he cuts me a ""deal!"" i bring the part and he'll replace it for $100. costing me $450. so i bring my truck in. when i pick it up, while driving home it became so much worse than before so i call and he says to bring it in... after inspecting the truck he claims it was a defective part, he says he should be charging me the extra labor but doesnt.. the next day i pick my truck up again, and he tells me somehow they allowed fuel to cross into my oil and i need an immediate oil change.. (mind you they just changed my oil less than two weeks prior) so on my way home... yet again.. my truck starts up with the same problems that prompted me to take it in... so i get another oil change... still no improvement with my vehicle!! so i take it upon myself to watch some you tube videos on how to do a tune up myself... and guess what... $98 dollars and 2 hours later... i... me... myself who knows very little about vehicles... fixed my truck by doing what i asked this guy to do for me in the first place!!! and it runs like new!!! stay away from this shop... they seem friendly... clearly that's not the case... i will be reaching out to corporate and whoever else i need to about them!!!!"
2-star,0,"if you take your car here for an oil change or smog check, be prepared for them to try to pressure you into other repairs that will cost you at least a few hundred bucks. they spent 10 minutes trying to tell us we needed to change the transmission fluid right away (among other things) because it smelled burnt. guess what guys! the dealer replaced the transmission 1 month ago as part of a recall. nice try though. other than that, it took a little longer than i thought it would for an oil change. overall, probably will be our last time going here."
5-star,1,"wow !!!! what a pleasurable experience.coming from california i needed a good mechanic. i stopped by purrfect auto and had a couple things done to my hyundai. i can't say enough how the manager tomas treated me. he is one of the trustworthy, nicest, manager of a auto repair facility. his brother r.j. and ron was great as well. if you need a great auto shop that will treat you like family purrfect auto on washington street is the place to go!!!!!!"
1-star,0,i just received a very insincere call from toma's telling me his boss was upset about my review and he needed to offer me 100 dollar credit. i would never ever risk taking my car back to this shop and the tone of voice and words he chose still made it like he was mad at me. i'm sorry he got in trouble for not doing his job right but i will not be bought and will not take my car there again.
5-star,1,"thorough service, head mechanic let us know what needed to be fixed . awesome personality, willing to work for you and with you. i will be coming back on saturday for the rest of the work that needs to be done. purrfect auto service is exactly what it says ! . i finally found a mechanic to work on my car, that my husband and i can trust. thanks !"
5-star,1,"excellent customer service! they stayed open late for me for a $10 smog check. checked my tire pressure, too! i appreciate you guys!"
5-star,1,"first time i went in was for a smog check and had a coupon from the summerlin flyer! the lady at the front desk is very professional and maurice the manager did the smog test and wrote a few things i needed in the future... he also fixed my husband's bmw hoses and we will definitely be back to fix a few other things! they are great for women to come to and be assured you will be taken care of not taken advantage of... thanks maurice! p.s. they are hard to find so when you are looking at kmart they are to left where the ""garden center"" used to be!!!"
1-star,0,"this place rotated my tires. next time i was in for an oil change and tire rotation, they said they could not rotate the tires because of broken studs on 2 of the wheels. guess what? they broke them the last time, but how do you prove it. also said i needed new front brakes and struts all around. i decided to take my car to the dealership. they fixed the studs and i did not need front brake job or struts. the dealership might be more expensive but you also don't wait around for 4 hours. they drive you to and from home. worth the price to go to the dealership."
5-star,1,"this purrfect auto is top of the line with very honest mechanics. the manager was so truthful with me and even told me what work i did not need done when other establishments tried to sucker me out of more money for useless work. i've been coming here for a while and have never had an issue. one day i came in for an oil change during my lunch hour and in my work uniform. they were extremely busy so i was going to come back another day. the manager saw the uniform and new i only had a limited amount of time, he went ahead and expedited my oil change right away and i was in and out in record time. to me that is top notch customer service. great staff, great mechanics, great business."
5-star,1,great place to check out if you have any problems with the car. i drove from california to nevada for a social visit. i hit a tire piece on the highway. my car started started making noise in the undercarriage. they checked and removed the plastic strip within five minutes. how much? i asked. no charge. whoa!! great guys and gals to give me 5-star service even though i had never been there before. maurice was very professional and courteous. i would go there again if i need any auto service.
5-star,1,diagnosed and fixed a problem on my car for a couple hundred bucks that could have easily cost me way more and saved my wife $300 on work she didn't need done but her dealership had told her she did.
1-star,0,"do not go here!!!, the ""repairs"" they did resulted in me bringing the suv back 3 times and ended up with them causing permeate damage to the engine rods, and banging now, they do not know what they are doing and will damage you car. this has been over a year of headaches in court and every thing else save your self the hassle and do not go there at all cost!!!."
1-star,0,"an age-old tale. a girl walks into a mechanic shop looking to get her oil changed while she goes across the street to yoga. she comes back and is met with a mechanic who goes through a laundry list of suggested replacements, transmission flushes...blah blah. ""i'll just stick with the oil change and consider the rest in the near future."" girl leaves and gets on summerlin parkway. within a few miles, her engine sounds like a locomotive and starts steaming. girl pulls to the side of the road, calls the mechanic shop and gets a guy to come to the rescue. ""follow me to the shop, and i'll take a look."" the diagnosis is a cracked radiator. funny. the radiator wasn't cracked when the girl arrived for her oil change. a cracked radiator isn't something that you can get by with - that just...slips through the cracks...(no pun...). girl calls her father, also a mechanic, who is not only candid, but eloquent in speech. ""i'll tell you what happened,"" he says, ""some fat mechanic leaned their overweight belly against your plastic radiator and it cracked. or clanked a tool against it because you're a girl who doesn't know anything about car repairs. fill the radiator with water, crack the lid, and get the hell out of there to a new repair shop."""
1-star,0,"my worst ever experience with mechanics! do not take your car to purrfect auto! they will damage your car only to con you into letting them fix it! i only needed an oil change and tune up. they convinced hubby (not me, i protested and threw a tantrun) that they needed to charge my a/c and do some other crap or ""the engine might freeze up"" when the a/c was fine. guess what? the a/c hasn't worked since they touched it! they must be psychic because after they put their mojo on it the engine did indeed freeze up! voila! abra cadabra! imagine if you will how much fun it was to drive over a thousand miles w/o a/c! this problem continues to evolve do to their finesse and after thy violated me for $400 i've now had to pay someone to fix their screw up and my compressor is out now which will cost another $700-$900! joy! they told me i didn't need a tune up, then claimed they changed the oil and filled the fluids. when i got out on the road in the midst of a cross country road trip i discovered they didn't even do this right! they took parts off the car so it wouldn't operate correctly then tried to sell me the parts to fix it! too. angry. now. must. finish. later"
5-star,1,i get extreme anxiety when it comes to any type of work or check ups on my car. i had a list of errands to run for the day so decided to spot here to get my emissions test completed first. i showed up shortly before 8 am and there were already a few cars in line. 2 lanes were open and the lane i was in was shorter because my car is a 2000. and guess what? i passed! lol. the whole visit was about 15 minutes total. it was completely painless and the lady who helped me was very polite. i love this location and am grateful it is so close.
3-star,0,the manager (miguel or mike..not too sure) is a dick. he needs to shave.. he looks very very unprofessional. he kept thinking he was hot shit. boasting that he had bitches.. what a lame. but the staff is awesome. the waiver guys were really helpful. and the inspectors were nice. fast and accommodating.. thank you state of arizona!
5-star,1,"i arrived and there was no cars at all, awesome! and yes my car passed emissions! :) employees were so friendly i guess because i was making them laugh and they invited me to come back and hang out with them :-) don't have lemonade waiting for me :-)"
1-star,0,"different experience this time. ran over after work and forgot my wallet. was .50 short from glove box change, tough luck. come by the next night and the supervisor, was a guy this time, tells me car failed and i will need to have a bunch of work done. i asked was it not just a gas cap? this is a lexus with 30k although it's a 2005. took it to a shop who changed the gas cap and reset the error code. went back for testing and the same supervisor stopped what he was doing to come over to test me. he asked if i took it to a shop, he was very suspicious of me. tested it and was not happy it passed, kept trying like i was pulling something over on him. begrudgingly he handed me the passed certificate."
5-star,1,could not have asked for a better experience. in and out in 5 minutes for $17. can this place teach the dmv about customer service.
5-star,1,"what would make a emission testing station lose stars would be if it took forever or cost more than expected. this is a little off the beaten path, but located miles away from my work and i was able to get there in the morning and went right through. i would recommend using the website so you can see the wait times and plan accordingly."
4-star,1,"wait time for monday afternoon, 3:45pm, was 10min. the people were friendly and helpful enough. this is the only location i go to. would recommend this location."
5-star,1,easy in...easy out! folks were friendly and made the emissions process hassle free! plus it's an added bonus to know that this place was close to work! i'm gonna recommend all of the out of state folks who relocated with me to bring their cars here on their lunch breaks!
1-star,0,ha this place is a joke out of the thousand cars i have taken to emissions the one washington is trash compared to the rest don't come here the morons can barley find the obd link plug in obd express lane backed up 12-15 cars and they doing a single car at a time while other places do 2 cars at once in the express lane
4-star,1,"came here because i thought i needed an emissions test to register my car in az. the manager was extremely nice, informative and answered all my questions. long story short, i didn't need to get an emissions test."
5-star,1,"i just showed up at 335p on a monday w/2 cars ahead of me, & including testing- i was on my way 9 min later! the technician was friendly, efficient, & even took time to answer a couple questions. for something nobody likes having to do, it was painless. the most inconvenient part of the whole thing was the traffic on my way there :) ps- i think it's stupid that in az my 2009 vehicle w/28k miles on it needs to be tested every 2yrs at $20 a pop. but that's not this emissions center's fault...."
3-star,0,"the employees are nice, the process doesn't take long, and it's not a horrific wait most of the time. as an added bonus, if you fail, the people in the office are very helpful!"
5-star,1,"donna inside the lobby was the most helpful, sweetest, most genuine person i've ever worked with at the facility like that. she explained everything in a very clear way and was more than willing to help me so that i did not have to use my free test after my first emission failure. so glad i came across her!"
5-star,1,"this was strangely painless. you can check wait times online and see what you're in store for. the listed wait time was 14 minutes and i think i only really waited for 8 minutes. the employees are friendly, fast and efficient- which can't be easy because it's got to be a hard job. all in all- it was a very nice surprise. the test was quick and very nice service. well done!"
3-star,0,"first time visiting this facility. went there around 4pm on a thursday afternoon. only 1 lane open, lane 2 to be exact. there were about 4 cars in front of me. few minutes after i arrived there, they opened up lanes 1 & 3. i got lucky and was pointed to lane 1. fifth car in lane 2 and was the first car getting into lane 1. took about 10 minutes to get everything settle and out of the site. wished they would just open up all 3 lanes in the beginning so people wouldn't have to wait in line for long. the cost for the emission was $27.75 for 2 years. i believe that tucson residents get charged less. check the adeq site before you go so you can find out how long you will be waiting."
5-star,1,i was in and out in less than 15 minutes. it wasn't half the hassle i was imagining it to be (it was my first time). cost is $27 and some change for regular vehicles. there's a website that shows you up-to-date wait times for all the emission testing stations in the valley. pretty cool!
3-star,0,"let's face it... who wants to go to the emissions test center and wait in line? after all, it does add a task to renewing a car's registration. and who wants to deal with the dmv. oh, me, of course. alas, visiting the emissions test centers in az is something that us folks with 5+year old cars must do every couple of years. here is my take on this particular station in a quick and down and dirty review that should help you figure things out. #1. check the website to see what the wait time is. #2. read the signs posted above the bays before you instinctively decide to take the shorter line. sometimes, the longer line goes faster because it is for cars that are younger than 10 years old. read the signs first! #3. be prepared to get out of your car when you pull in to the bay. they need to get in your car to hook up the device that reads your car's computer. be prepared. have your card ready. #4. don't wait until the last minute! go before your expiration date, like on the 17th of the month or the 10th. i kicked this review down to #3 because the station at 16th street handled a bigger crowd more efficiently. let's face it, we just want to get the heck outta there and efficiency is much more important to me. the staff was still friendly and operated with fast precision. they know what they are doing."
4-star,1,it's an emissions testing station. my standards are pretty low. the wait was appropriate given the line i was in. i would have given it 5 stars if they had a line for vehicles that didn't need their exhaust hooked up to get tested ( vehicle computer testing) like mine.
4-star,1,"it is normally not like me to give a good rating on anything that is associated with the dmv but this is definitely an exception. they have a new tool that you can few current wait times at any emission location which makes going and scheduling time to do so, so much easier. i was able to run on my lunch break and i was in and out of there in less than 10 minutes. the current wait time when i left my job was 2 minutes and that was how long i waited to get my testing done. yay for something done correctly and in a organized manner with the dmv."
2-star,0,"i hesitate to be critical of anb but i want to alert other consumers. i used to go to los olivos hand car wash until they closed and decided to try anb since they are also a hand car wash. i believe they try very hard and are good people. however, i had a car wash of just the exterior and it took almost 2 hours. los olivos traditionally got those done in 30 minutes. also, this is not the first time they werevery slow. unfortunately, imo, anb needs more employees to allow for their volume of vehicles and the employees need better equipment to allow them to be more efficient. again, i think the people work hard but there just are not enough of them and they don't have the needed equipment like los olivos did."
5-star,1,"i fired my other hand wash three years ago and hadn't had my cars hand washed since then. they'd been through a pressure sprayer occasionally, but never a real wash until i found this place. they aren't fast. but they aren't expensive. and they're more than worth it. they made not just one but both of my vehicles look better than they had in years which wasn't easy and that was just on their basic wash option. my recommendation, go when it's busy and go next door to harvey's wineburger and get a beer and a burger while your car is expertly washed by hand. you won't be disappointed."
4-star,1,"4.5 stars **came in when they open to avoid waiting long pros: reasonable price for hand wash friendly staff i got dirt all over my car and it looks 99% sparkly after the wash inside looks clean they follow my request for no fragance and no armor on dashboarh just simple wipe cons: they did miss drying up under both sides of my rearview mirror and also on the back bumper, you see streaks of water all the way down. but it's a 5 mins fix for me and for the price and other things they do right, its so miniscule."
3-star,0,"it seems harder and harder to find carwashes that are not a ""do it yourself drive-through"". i went to anb to get a hand wash and have someone clean the interior while i sat my lazy ass inside the air conditioned waiting room. i have to preface this by saying i have a love hate relationship with carwashes. they never seem to do an adequate job, and yet i keep returning because i dislike having to clean my own car. (especially in the arizona heat). anb was really slow, and i went in the morning on a monday, i can't imagine how long a weekend would have taken. they did an awesome job on the exterior, hand drying goes a long way. my only complaint is that it didn't look like they vacuumed the seats at all. they still had dog hair on them when the car was returned. perhaps the same amount of dog hair as when i brought the car in. not overwhelmingly so, but definitely noticeable. if i am paying 25 buckaroos for you to clean my car, and you take over an hour i would expect the sets to be vacuumed. i annoy myself with my whining on this subject, i really should wash it myself."
4-star,1,great service and staff!! i would highly recommend going on the weekdays.. i was there on wednesday.. they are less busy on those days and pay more attention to your car.. they are extremely busy on weekends and it's all hand wash. the team did pay attention to details
1-star,0,"the customer service is pretty non-existent and after 90 minutes of waiting...i came to find that they were just then pulling our car into the washing bay. i won't pretend to understand their ""system"" (assuming they have one?), but it's ridiculously inefficient and there is 0 sense of urgency. my husband is a fan of hand washes, but i have better things to do on a hot saturday morning than wait 2 hours for a car wash. if you have to hours to waste, feel free to do it here. your car will be clean. if you actually value your time? go somewhere else."
2-star,0,"i should've read the reviews: so slow they don't use turtle wax, they use sloth wax. rome wasn't built in a day nor was my car washed. continental drift leaves this place in the dust. holy moly, i lost two hours of my life waiting for an extra-medium car wash. the owner / the whole team is very friendly --- i heard somebody say some customers head to the bar or go shopping while the car is being washed. if that sounds like your idea of a day, have at it."
1-star,0,worst ever. waited 1.5 hours and they hadn't even washed the car yet. when i asked for it back they didn't even refund me. never again
4-star,1,i had asked before i checked-in what the wait was going to be and i was told 45minutes. 2 hours later i received my vehicle. there was nobody in the office to even get updates from or to even ask for my vehicle back so that i could leave. not sure even if they do a decent job that i'd return because i could've spent 2 hours at home with the same outcome.
1-star,0,"sadly this shop has gone down hill over time. my family has been bringing their cars here and were happy when dana took over as initially the quality and service was great. unfortunately, they are completely understaffed. my husband and daughter had come within the last few weeks and waited over 2 hours! i figure that was an outlier but that is not the case. i asked before i let them take my car and the gal said 45 mins to 1 hour. fast forward 2 hours later and i was still waiting. when i approached my car dana came over. his response, i would spend the same amount of time at any other local hand wash. challenge accepted dana! i'll take my car and try the other local hand wash options... funny aside: there were 5 other customers waiting for their cars. we were like survivors on an island just waiting for rescue and sharing our stories of delays and drop in service quality. when one of the cars would be done the rest of us would cheer for the winning car owner and look at each other as we continued our wait in the loser's lounge."
1-star,0,"first time i visited they were great, second time i sat for 45 minutes and eventually pulled my car out of the line. they said they were short on people. hope they figure it out. it shouldn't take 2 hours for a basic hand wash. i won't come here again."
1-star,0,"over 2 hours! and they did a terrible job. they claim it takes that long because it is a hand car wash, however they are completely under staffed. when i pointed out how long i had been waiting to the manager, he just said they are busy, but he continued to just stand around and watch instead of jump in and help the 2 employees working. never going back again. they won't be around long."
1-star,0,stopped in for a quick car was... its been two hours. extra $5 because my 31inch tires are big... lol not a peep by anyone on how long this was going to take or apology.
3-star,0,"as much as i like this place, do not come here if you've got some place to be as the wait it horrible!! the service is ok, the final outcome is acceptable but wait will kill you! if dana ( the owner ) is there, things run far better. if he's out, come back another day!"
5-star,1,"i have been on the market for a new hand car wash and i must say i am thrilled with this finding. great staff, nice sitting area and i was impressed with how quickly they had finished for a hand wash. dana and the crew were great. all of my questions were answered and i will be back for my next wash!"
1-star,0,"i just left this place after 2 hours of waiting for my car to be washed. i understand an hour waiting at a 100% hand wash place. but 2?! not okay. there were only 4 people drying and polishing the cars, 1 of which was on his phone texting, another was moving at glacial pace. i am not usually one to complain about waiting but this was completely unacceptable. i wanted to tip them to give me my keys just so i could get out of there."
5-star,1,"this is place is awesome!! so friendly, family owned and operated and they did a great job on my car for a really reasonable price. definitely not going anywhere else but here for my car wash again... and i was told by another customer they do great tinting as well."
5-star,1,just found this place. i had been going to the car wash up the street but this place only does hand washes so i don't have to worry about scratches on my audi. the owner was really nice & they seemed to care. i'll be back!
5-star,1,excellent job. well worth the price for a vip wash. not a full detail by any means but good for in between the big details. great customer service. ok and out in 30 minutes.
5-star,1,all i have to say is this place is beyond amazing on what they do! i got so many compliments on how my car look awesome from the inside. everyone was so nice and friendly. i'm going back soon and of course i let everyone know on how great this place is.i have attached some pictures but let me tell you all that the results where beyond amazing! my seats and carpets where all shampoo. i forgot to mention i had just come back from a vacation and there was sand everywhere! the pictures are not to fair on how awesome the car looked at the end. keep up the awesome job you guys do. its appreciated! this is coming from a person that is very picky with everything!
5-star,1,came here on a whim after i read the reviews on yelp. got the signature wash for $19.99 which they did a fantastic job. i was greeted right when i pulled into the car wash lot. i was assisted right away by a friendly face letting me know of my options. then dana the owner came out just as pleasant to make sure i had been taking care of. i had some scuff on the side of my care that i didn't think could be removed. but without me even asking dana used some solution and it came right off. i will definitely be back and be spreading the word about his business. to top it off it's a black owned business which i love to hear. thank you dana and workers for your customer service!!!!
5-star,1,i moved to phoenix 2 months ago and this is my new go to hand car wash! my car looks brand new and the customer service is incredible.
5-star,1,"one word: juanita! she is awesome in all her roles: cashier, manager, and worker-all at once! and i believe other customers would totally agree! dana and family have a great carwash (best in phoenix-hands down!); and hopefully it stays that way by making sure juanita is well compensated for all her roles & has help when she needs it. i personally witnessed approximately 10-12 cars come through during the lunch hour on friday, in an half hour to 45-minute period. things backed up; esp. to pay, while juanita handled it all-working in all areas! if she goes it will be huge loss; and without doubt, impact the success of phoenix's best carwash! hold on to her dana!!!"
5-star,1,"i recently bought a brand new car so i wanted to find a good car wash to take it to because i have heard horror stories about the automatic car washes and how they can mess up your shifter. i searched for a place near my house and anb was the first to pop up. i pulled up and was greeted by dana who is also the owner and he was genuine right away! he's funny and has excellent customer service. he doesn't come off as an owner at all because he literally assists with the washes, steps in as the cashier and just has many other duties. even though my car was already clean on the inside, it was like i just drove it off of the lot. the exterior was shiny and just perfect! i couldn't be happier. i know that this will be my permanent place for my car washes moving forward. i highly recommend especially because it is a local business and i'm a full supporter! thanks dana and your wonderful team!"
5-star,1,"this location has changed ownership over the years. it's the most convenient location near me for a hand car wash so i have been going here for more than a decade, with a brief pause when a past owner thought bikini car washes were a good idea (they weren't). i hope the new owner stays! they were fast, courteous, reasonably priced ($50 special for a hand wax). the owner is very friendly and they did a nice job with my car! it looks brand new after dust storm filth."
5-star,1,"love this place. always pay close attention to detail and if you have something you need touched up, don't drive away upset, bring it up and they will have no issue correcting it. today i needed just a little touch up with a vacuum in the trunk and the owner came over and made sure it was perfect before i left! can't be thankful enough for this type of customer service when it seems like most car washes strive for quantity and not quality"
5-star,1,"one of the most amazing hand carwash places ! really hard working team they honestly do such an amazing job, one of the workers there named imanuel did my car an left it really amazing dana the boss man told me his best guy would take care of me an did! he took the initiative to give me all my worths pay an was really nice to me which was a plus on my books. i recommend imanuel to any new comers or old timers, im happy for coming in will be coming back to this place more an more!"
5-star,1,"i just purchased the vip service and although more pricey than other offerings from other places, i found the service to be of great value. the work and results is very similar to detailing services offered by other companies. this is a service that's not going to be quick, which you shouldn't expect especially on the weekend. i will definitely come back with my other vehicles. keep up the great work!"
5-star,1,"we take both of our daily drivers here as well as our old off-road fun vehicle. these people do a great job and they always make sure every part of the vehicle is clean and dry before delivery. prices are very fair considering there are no machines here it's all hand wash ensuring no mirrors get broken and the paint condition stays nice. i will be taking all 3 of our vehicles here. also, the employee mike did a phenomenal job getting some puppy throw up out of my carpet and they were very very fair in the up-charge for doing this, that is when they won my business for life."
5-star,1,wow! have not ever been to a car wash like this. it looks old on the outside but the staff is absolutely wonderful and they care about the work they do. it took them at least 45 minutes to give my car a simple $16.99 wash. they are very very very thorough and hard-working. definitely going to come back to this place!
5-star,1,thank you vince for the great service and making our day... your shop is very caring and made sure we were taken care of.... you made our day ... there sure be more shops like this one...i highly recommend this place....caio
5-star,1,"i was in a car accident that i was not at fault for. brought my car to aw and they walked me through everything. al, kimberly, imran, and kristin were the best ever! i cannot express to you how nice, helpful, and efficient they were! they made my entire experience less stressful, took that worry off my shoulders. when i picked up my car it was detailed, engine washed/polished, car clean as a whistle! i am an extremely satisfied and happy customer. thank you aw!!!"
5-star,1,"i was referred to aw collision by the honda dealership. this was an exceptional experience from very professional staff. kimberly was delightful from the first time she answered the phone. al helped deal with the responsible party's insuance claims adjuster, who was not at all a nice person to work with. imram has exceptional customer service skills, he called to keep me updated on the progress of the repairs as each phase progressed. they detailed my car before i picked it up. the repaired side looked perfect, the paint color matched exactly. i just cant say enough about them making a difficult situation a much better experience. i would definietly use them again if needed, and highly recommend them to others. great job everyone, thank you shannon summers"
5-star,1,"i'm completely satisfied and happy with my experience with aw collision. teresa h. help me a lot. their customer service was exceptional and every single one of their staff were friendly, nice, and professional. they kept me updated throughout the whole process. my car looks great. i have a cadillac srx 2014, they cleaned my car thoroughly before i picked it up. they took care of everything in dealing with the car insurance for me to make sure my car got the parts it needed to be back in great condition before the accident. i definitely recommend aw collision. they're the best. i will recommend this place to everyone!!"
5-star,1,"exceptional customer service and amazing work!! i was referred to aw collision through my honda dealership after i was rear-ended in my brand new '17 honda accord. both theresa and wendy were extremely helpful throughout my entire experience at this body shop. my insurance wrote an estimate to have my bumper repaired and not replaced, however theresa reassured me that she would let me know the extent of the damage after they removed it and would write a supplement to my insurance company. sure enough, i did get a brand new bumper all thanks to theresa. theresa is such a sweetheart and truly cares about her customers! when i tried getting a rental car through hertz (whom i had to use through my insurance) and was given a hard time (they said they had no vehicles available), theresa was very persistent in calling multiple locations and handling all rental car and insurance phone calls. my accord looks brand new again and i am impressed with the work done on my bumper. i would definitely return to aw collision! thank you theresa and wendy!"
5-star,1,"this is the second time that i've brought my car here, and it has once again been cpnfirmed that this is the only place i'll take my car to get repaired after being in an accident. i was rear-ended by some men from the netherlands in a budget rental car pn june 16th. the insurance company affiliated with the rental company was really difficult to get ahold of and maintain communication with; however, theresa did an excellent, outstanding job at holding the insurance company accountable in order to get my car fixed as quickly as possible. when i picked up my car, it was mpre beautiful tgan ever before and was completely detailed inside and out - engine and everything! all the staff are very friendly and very efficient at their jobs. i wouldn't take my car anywhere else! trust this company completely and wholeheartedly!"
5-star,1,"i went to aw collision after being rear-eneed in my 2016 cadillac. wendy was very helpful and teresa took care of my vehicle. teresa was great to work with and wanted to make sure that i was satisfied with all of my repairs. even tough i have my car back, teresa is still working with the other person""'s insurance company to work through the repairs and the costs associated with the rental car. key insurance was the other insurance carrier and has been a nightmare for myself, teresa, and my attorney, adam mcclausky, to work with. my husband has stage 4 cancer and they all made sure that there were no unnecessary trips or panic associated with the entire issue. thank you guys!!"
5-star,1,"after reading many reviews for aw collision i knew i picked the right place. boy was i right. my honda accord was rear ended. i went to the other party for an estimate and they tried giving me all after market parts. once i talked to tom he stated thats not how they do business. tom order all original honda parts and kept me up to date during the repair process. my car was repaired beyond my expectations. tom even went a step further where he detailed my entire car, including the engine bay. once i got my car back could not believe the perfection of the repair. i was very happy with the outcome. if you need your car repaired this is the place to go. trust me you will make the correct decision. thanks tom you guys are the best."
5-star,1,"diane went over a high curb right in front of our redlands home and the left side of the front bumper of our 2017 cadillac xts ripped slightly away. even though we could almost put the bumper back in its designated slots, it soon became evident that the bumper would flare out again even more at high freeway speeds--especially in windy conditions. so i showed the damaged bumper to the service tech at cadillac of las vegas, and he referred me to aw collision, alerting me that repairs would probably cost over $2,000, because i likely needed a new front bumper. i quickly drove the vehicle to aw collision, and was informed that if a new bumper was ordered, it would have to be repainted, because cadillac bumpers just come in basic black color. with a three-part painting process needed to blend in new paint with the car's existing unusual deep amethyst metallic color, this sounded like a nightmare to me. but not to worry! the exterior bumper sustained no visible damage--not even cosmetic. only an out of sight fastener had been ripped,. and after a physical inspection estimator theresa told me that a skilled technician on staff could repair the existing bumper with plastic soldering, and the car would look like new. she was friendly and professional, and i was ultimately given a very reasonable written estimate for recommended repairs that totaled just under $500. i scheduled an appointment for service, left the car for just 2-1/2 days, and when i picked it up it had been washed with care and indeed looked just like new. since then, the repaired bumper has firmly held together in all kinds of driving conditions. based on this experience, if i need any future body work performed on this vehicle, i will not hesitate to trust those repairs to aw collision."
5-star,1,three weeks after buying a brand new volvo someone slammed into my rear bumper. volvo las vegas referred me to aw collision and i couldn't be happier! when the insurance adjuster came out to give me an estimate she didn't notice that the part that holds the bumper to the car was broken but aw collision did and now my bumper looks as good as new after their repair. aw handled all the insurance details and the whole process was very smooth. tom and theresa was very professional and i wouldn't hesitate to use aw collision again.
5-star,1,"i got into an accident and took my car to aw collision because they are a dealer certified collision repair center. i got an original estimate of the damage from an estimator. when i took it here theresa realized there was more extensive damage than even myself or the estimator had noticed. she was very helpful. she kept in contact during the 3 week period my car was in the shop. she arranged for enterprise to pick me up and drop me off. overall service was fantastic. i highly recommended this place to anyone who needs their car fixed after being in a collision. also, the detail they did on the car was amazing. thank you all for your help and getting me my cadillac back!! -jerome price"
1-star,0,"when someone rear-ended my car, i was really furious. but then i found these guys, who offered me great prices and seemed like honest people. the work they did on my car was flawless. i love it! thank you theresa for helping to get my car done as fast as possible. thanks a lot! this was my previous review of this company. but recently we discovered mice in the engine that originated from this shop. they ate through several different parts in the engine. the boss of the workshop stated that he didn't care and would rather make us pay to our insurance. i even reported this to volvo, who said they won't be recommending people to this workshop again after the utterly rude behavior they presented."
5-star,1,when i got into an accident i chose aw collision because i head been here before. theresa was my estimator and helped me with my insurance claim with american national. my vehicle was repaired with all oem parts from honda. aw fixed my vehicle to perfection. theresa made sure my vehicle was detailed and she went above and beyond to have a few areas buffed for me. she kept me updated on my repairs and made me feel stress free during this situation. i recommend theresa and aw collision.
5-star,1,"5-11-17 updated review. it's. it letting me leave another one. the team at aw collision has done it again! my passenger side mirror in my mini cooper needed to be replaced and repainted because i hit a construction cone. i took it to ozzie and tonya and they went above and beyond and my new mirror cap repainted. it matches absolutely perfect and looks like nothing aver happened. thank you guys so much for doing excellent work and having such great customer service. i will refer anybody to you if they ever need any body work. i had a great experience with aw collision. this was my second time using their services. first time (about 4 years ago) i had an accident in my volvo c30 (not my fault lol), and the repairs were flawless like nothing happened. their customer service and communication back then was so good that i decided to use them again this time around for my mini cooper. there was debris on the freeway and i could not avoid it and it did a lot of damage to the bumper and fender. i bought the mini in portland from a dealership almost 3 years ago. that dealership lied to me when i asked them if it had prior damage/ accidents and they said no. 6 months later in this hot and dry climate my paint started cracking on the hood and progressively spread and got worse because there was damage and they did a mickey mouse job on repairing it. so i figured i'll just get that repaired as well while my car was there already to get that other damage repaired. once again it looks flawless and better than new. the customer service from everyone there is great, they explained everything in detail to me. from what they were going to repair, to why my paint had cracked, to the quality products that they use and why. you get a lifetime guarantee as well which makes me happy and confident that they stand by their work. i've had two separate great experiences and i will refer people and use them again myself (hopefully not anytime soon lol). i brought my car in kinda dirty and when i picked it up it was so clean on the inside and out! that too made me super happy because i was planning to get and nice car wash after i picked it up and now i did not have to. thanks so much you guys a big thumbs up to you all!!"
1-star,0,"i had a new escalade that somebody wrecked. i was referred to take it to aw. it took two months to fix with a number of excuses why it was taking so long. i was even told one time it was because of the insurance adjuster, i called the adjuster and it was not true. now after two months i get a call that is done and i can come pick it up. i leave work and drive across town to pick it up and guess what, it was not even done. they missed the a pillar damage, what? so they will me to come the next day. i get a call the next day and they tell me to wait one more day as they wanted it to be perfect for me. so finally i go get it. there are pieces of garbage in the paint so big i can catch a nail on them. i took it home over the weekend so i could inspect it. i put blue tape on each piece of junk, run, hair and sag and there was probably 50 to 60 pieces of tape all over the repairs. monday morning i called them and asked to talk to the manager. he asked me to meet him tuesday morning at 8 am. i drive there and he is late so the painter comes out to look at it. i proceed to tell him all the tape all over the truck are flaws in the paint, he proceeds to argue with me over it and saying one of the scratches in the paint is from being washed, i never washed it. finally the manager shows up and barely says a word but they will take care of it. so again two more days to fix it. haha, again they did crappy work. all they did was buff the hell out of it so now the new paint work is glass smooth and all the original factory paint work has its usual orange peel in it. when i pointed it out they stand there saying nothing. that kinda told me they are use to being called out on their poor work. i highly do not recommend them. take your car to exotic and get a good job done. this place is a disaster."
5-star,1,"this is the recommended honda body shop (at least for honda west since they don't have a body shop). replaced the rear bumper cover on my new 2017 ridgeline. no paintwork involved so i can't speak to that but their workmanship on the cover was excellent. fit was perfect and no scratches where it meets the metal. even washed and detailed it, wasn't expecting that! thanks guy for a job well done."
5-star,1,aw just fixed my car they replaced my bumper and fender and change my wheel they did a great job and i really recommend this place they are very time efficient and did the work well!
5-star,1,"i was recently caught in a stone storm (pea gravel) and i contacted my auto insurance company to remain nameless to protect the innocent. i received the names of three local body shops which i reviewed and found lacking. i contacted my vehicle dealership and was told they only use a w collision and i went there. i called the shop and talked with tom and agreed to come in on saturday morning for him to see the vehicle and give my insurance information. tom called them and started the process, because the color is a pearly white the damage is hard to see from three feet away. tom had his ace guy mark up the vehicle for the insurance adjuster to view the car. tom is the reason i chose aw rather than the kmart of body shops my insurance company wanted me to use with lifetime guarantees. if you have a need for body work go to a w collision you will not be disappointed."
5-star,1,"highly recommend aw collision if you need anything done to your car! they did amazing and have great customer service. tanya wendy and tom really helped me out!! never had anything done to my car before, and many people told me bad experiences they've had with other body shops but they did amazing and the bumper matches perfect! if you want the job done right this is the place to go!! they were also very friendly to my new puppy that i can't leave home alone just yet haha!"
5-star,1,"i took my car into aw collision after my accident. tom and the entire staff were very help and supportive throughout the entire process. the insurance company ended up totaling my vehicle, but i cannot say enough about the time and effort that aw put in. they made sure that i was well informed at every point during the process. my parents had their car repaired at aw so i know the quality of work is second to none. if you are having a hard time with the insurance company and need honest opinions and amazing service aw should be the first place on your list. i hope i never get into another car accident, but if i do there is absolutely no question as to where i will bring my vehicle."
1-star,0,"run from this place it is a black hole for automotive repair. they have had our car for almost 4 months and blames everyone else. this was only the back right quarter panel, easy job. they didn't even start on it for over 36 days. we only went there as a referral form the dealer and they have stopped referring them too. stay away !!!!!!"
5-star,1,great srvice ! higher recommend!!! i had a car accident with my honda accord 2016 and i got helpful from a-z .everyone so kinds. the car looks like new one and like nothing happened even they wash my car in and out.
5-star,1,"i just picked up my 2012 cadillac cts today, aw collison did a great job on matching my pearl paint and getting my insurance company to pay for original quality parts. overall very happy with the repair, they were very helpful and the car looks like it did when i bought it, i'd definitely recommend this place to a friend."
1-star,0,"first time using a body shop and had a very bad experience with aw collision. our brand new, 2-hour old cadillac srx (t-boned by a hit & run driver) was towed to this shop as recommended by cadillac of las vegas on april 18th. our vehicle was not driveable so we knew that we were going to need a rental car which was fine. things started out okay, and our point of contact was enrique who was very polite and cordial and kept us up to date via phone and emails. the adjuster went to look at the vehicle and approved the quote, our insurance company sent them a check within 3 business days and they were able to get the parts ordered. we also knew from the start that it was going to take a week to get the new door and quarter panel as they were on back order. the parts came in and we were told by enrique that the vehicle would be ready at the very latest on may 16th. well, everything started to go downhill from there. aw then started working on the vehicle and when they finally cut into it they found that there was further damage and that the adjuster needed to come out again to approve some further charges and request another check. enrique then said the vehicle was going in to paint on friday the 17th and he thought we would be able to pick it up may 22nd or 23rd. when we didn't hear back from enrique we called and were told he was on vacation for the rest of the week and now the vehicle wouldn't be ready until after memorial day. after the holiday weekend we were told the vehicle had to be brought to the dealership to have the suspension repaired and it would only take a day or two and then back to aw for final detailing. when we didn't hear back we called cadillac and were told that aw forgot to order some parts. cadillac felt bad that we were now going to have to wait another week for the extra parts so they gave us a loaner to use. so, we turned our rental car in which cost us $975, our insurance only covers a max of $750. we spoke to enrique and he told us that he would speak with the adjuster and they could get the charges rolled in to the additional work and we could take that overage off our $1000 deductible. the vehicle was finally repaired by the dealership and delivered back to aw on june 3rd. we called aw on monday june 6th and were told the vehicle was ready but before we could pick it up, they needed final paperwork from our insurance company. come to find out our insurance company was awaiting paperwork from aw. the vehicle ended up sitting there ready to go for the entire week and we were finally able to pick it up on saturday, june 11th, almost 2 months. i forgot to mention that for over a week we were unable to reach enrique and were now told that we had a new contact named tom. we spoke to tom a couple of times on the phone prior to coming in. we told him what enrique said about the extra $225 we paid for the rental car and he said there was nothing they could do about it. when we arrived on saturday to pick up the vehicle i wanted to look over the vehicle with he and the manager ozzie but they wanted to collect the payment instead. we chose to pay cash and tom made a snide remark about this being a cashless society, very rude. i complained about the extra rental car charges, as this was all there fault we were delayed since they forgot to order parts and didn't do the work when they promised to. tom again said there wasn't anything he could do and when i got upset, ozzie gave us 50% of it back. the entire time tom was just rude and brash. he told us they washed the car the day before but it rained so they didn't have time to wash it again before we picked it up. we don't think it was ever washed, the dust on the entire vehicle was very thick and heavy. this was also a new vehicle and the inside was pristine when we received it from cadillac. when we picked it up from aw there were several dents in the leather and grease on the light colored interior, very, very upsetting! i will give kuddos for the outside, they did do a good job on that. we would never recommend this shop to anyone for all the grief they put us through. not sure why cadillac uses them, they have other bad reviews on yelp as well."
1-star,0,"being new to las vegas, i called the car dealer and asked them where to have my car repaired. it was damaged during transport. they told me this is where they send everyone. aw was really nice when i went there and explained what happened. they told me to file a claim with my insurance company and they would take care of it under the comprehensive portion of the policy. i did and the insurance company took over. that's when the problems started. aw gave me an estimate, the insurance company came in $2000 less. back and forth between the two the finally came to an agreement, the original estimate i was given. this process took a month. aw didn't even touch the car for 2 weeks, because they couldn't get an answer from the insurance company. not true. the insurance company called them, and so did i, during those 2 weeks. all this time the clock is ticking on the rental car i had. the car finally got repaired, and looked fine. will i ever use them again, no. after going to the car dealer and complaining about aw, i was told by a service person they have to send people there if someone calls. if i would've gone into the dealer they would have sent me somewhere else, not to aw. avoid aw at all costs."
5-star,1,"i just picked up the second vehicle i have had repaired at this shop. i worked with mike throughout the entire process. he very clearly explained to me what the process would be to have my vehicle repaired so that i would understand the time required for the job. i can't tell that there was ever any damage to my truck. it looks great! plus they took the time to detail the interior of my truck. everyone in the office was very friendly and helpful. if i need body work done again, which i hope i don't, i will head back to aw collision."
5-star,1,"my honda odyssey was repaired at awc after an accident in april. repair took longer than expected but they did a great job fixing my car. they made sure my car rental was covered during the extra time it took during the repair. car looks as good as brand new. awc has very friendly and courteous staff. david morales, jeff, tanya, ozzie were all very helpful during the repair process. david dropped/ picked me up from work when i took the car back a few time for minor issues. david addressed my concerns immediately and also got my car detailed as well."
5-star,1,awesome repair work. the staff at aw were very professional and handled my vehicle repairs in a timely manner. when i picked up my vehicle the repair work and paint was factory perfect. i would highly recommend aw to my friends and for my future needs.
1-star,0,don't take your car here. the dealership recommended aw but i would never recommend to anyone. they took longer then they said to fix my door and when i finally got the car back it wouldn't open from the inside! i took it back to be fixed then a rattle and air leak started in the door. i again took it back and it still didn't get fixed. the dealership took a look at the door and agreed it was not done correctly. i took it back a third time b/c they said they had fired those working their previously and the current team would do it right. again they didn't fix the problem. the only reason i give them one star is b/c of the friendly and professional lady at the front desk. they must have some kind of deal with the dealerships to keep getting their business.
5-star,1,the cadillac dealership in las vegas recommended aw collision and i am happy that they did. ben the service rep maintained very good communications with me so that their was no confusion on what was being done and when it was being done. my car looks a good as new. i would highly recommend their services.
5-star,1,had an awesome time 4wheeling here! first time doing this and highly recommend this place. our tour guide charles was awesome and very professional! he made sure we were always on the trail and made sure our experience was not only fun but safe! definitely great if you are visiting las vegas to take a break from all the eating and casinos haha! the person we booked the reservation with her name was kim who was very nice and truly appreciates her customers. everyone here truly cares about the customer experience! so if you are a local or visiting you won't be disappointed. also way better deals here than what i found on groupon. the tours on groupon can be misleading. i saw an advertised price for a 4 hour tour. but the total ride time was only 90 minutes. they factor travel time and a lunch break. definitely better value from what i saw online.
5-star,1,"an annual trip to las vegas taking some clients of mine one of them suggested we do something a little different, like atv riding. so to the internet i went to research and get some numbers to call, which turned into a daunting task till that 8th phone call to kim at above all. some calls led to vague description on what really was included in the tour, some were just pokey rides at turtle pace thru a visual history book. cost didnt matter much but level of excitement, the challenge of riding and fun did. kim was the only one that assured me we would have a blast and she was the only one that wasn't pushy and gimmicky. i called her back and then all the five of us had to do was wait till our time to have fun. the awesome experience started when dave picked us up at our hotel and drove us to their office to fill out paperwork and get outfitted with safety gear. he was even a little early picking us up at our hotel and was a pleasant conversation about real las vegas all the way to the shop. he did a great job building up our anticipation for the ride. once there jacob quickly went thru the paperwork and took payment, then to get geared up with him and charles. shortly we were loaded up and off to eldorado canyon. once there the atvs were quickly unloaded, brief safety speech and tutorial with each rider on how to use their machine. then a quick circle around the ""track"" to get used to it and off we went. jacob in the lead and charles following in the back. two of us are very experienced on atv, two more have some experience, and one it was his first time. they went at our pace and it didnt take long and we all were flying thru the trails and having a blast. no more descriptions other than the little over 2 hours of riding were way more exciting than we thought it would be. sweaty, dusty, dirt beards, exercised and smiles from ear to ear described the 5 of us on the ride back to our hotel. to sum it up, the entire group of 40 in town all went to drive exotic cars around the track the next day, the 4 clients that came with me for the atv riding said they had more fun on them than in the lamborghini and ferrari's they drove. highly recommended from all 5 of us."
5-star,1,"we have been renting for the last five years in a row, and we always have the best experience! kim and her team are true professionals and know their stuff! the equipment is always in great shape and you're pretty much guaranteed a great time!"
5-star,1,"heading to vegas now and i've already booked my third tour with above all! the staff is amazing, friendly, and so accommodating. kim, jim, and the rest of the family are great hosts who know how to show you a great desert experience. you need to add this to your list of things to do while in nevada! forever a customer and forever my friends now! just great people and so much fun! love it! see ya soon kim xx"
5-star,1,"great company and tour. i am a very experienced atv and dirt bike rider, we were out in vegas and i wanted to take the ""guys"" out on some atv's in the desert. i called kim and discussed what our options were, since i didn't want some tour with inexperienced riders that went 5 miles per hour to a gold mine. she told me my options and we set up a private ride with a guide. they picked us up on time at our hotel, took us to the office to fill out the paperwork and get helmets and gloves, then off to the desert with the atv's and our guide jacob. jacob was awesome, after talking to him about riding and the experience level of our group, he took us on an awesome tour, riding some really rough parts and a couple hill climbs. riding with jacob, was like riding with one of the guys, and not like your typical guide. great company, great price and great ride!! we will be back!!"
5-star,1,"these guys are awesome. my car broke down in front of the shop and kim and jim (and friends) were totally helpful. cooled my car down, and let it sit while i went to get a part. they also do uhaul rentals ( compatibility rates with uhaul) found out, so we will be renting from them. i could not of broke down in front a a nicer shop."
2-star,0,"word to the wise... when renting a uhaul, after getting gas and when turning in your vehicle, take a picture of your gas gauge. i was charged for a 1/4 tank because i supposedly brought the vehicle back short of the half tank line. not the case at all. shameful. aside from that, truck was clean and woman checking in and out was very personable. it's terrible they gouge the unsuspecting on the gas charge."
5-star,1,i had a wicked awesome time with you guys! my friend called you guys about 4 days before we arrived in las vegas from miami. we were accommodated with a cab ride from our hotel by jim who had very interesting stories about his time here in las vegas. our tour guide whose name i unfortunately do not remember was very knowledgeable about the area which we rode the atvs in. he was polite and had great stories to share as well. we had a great time and i will definitely recommend you guys to my friends who will be visiting las vegas in the future. i will be back for memorial wknd 2k17 and will definitely rent from you guys again. thanks a million for the hospitality. you guys rock!
5-star,1,"we were on a family vacation after christmas and all wanted to take an atv ride. i contacted above all las vegas atv tours and was informed by jim all they had to offer, and seemed the best tour for us. i made the reservation through kim, and she was most helpful in choosing the right tour and time for us. after arriving, we were thoroughly informed of what to expect and all the safety features we needed to be aware of. our guides, david and chris made sure we were all prepared for the tour before departing. they were very knowledgeable of the area and atvs, and made it fun everyone. our group ranged in age from 9 to 75 and all had a wonderful time. the younger ones rode in the ranger with one of the adults. everything was handled so pleasantly and professionally from beginning to end. we would recommend this tour to anyone visiting las vegas who wants a fantastic day in the desert."
5-star,1,great day- guide was great personal and always concerned about our safety. atv was well maintained and he spent a lot of time and effort to make sure we had an awesome day- definitely a great day and perfect deal
5-star,1,"took the gf to above all las vegas atv tours and watercraft rentals on 11/22/2016 after speaking with kim a few days prior to schedule a time. when we arrived, kim's husband was there to greet us and said we would be joined by another couple for our 1-3pm tour. long story short, we waited a bit for another guide to show, that person ended up meeting our group at the trails. my gf was a bit timid throughout the experience having never been on atv or dirtbikes. because of this we allowed kim's husband to guide the other couple, and chris (i believe) was guiding me and the gf. he was extremely patient and encouraging. also, after riding back to the start point, we allowed my gf to wait in the car for she had enough riding. me and chris hit some hills nearby before meeting the other couple at the start point. all in all, i enjoyed my time, employees are wonderful, tour guide chris is super cool and i will be recommending above all to friends and family. ***2 adult riders with atv and safety equipment came out to $275***"
1-star,0,"worst company i have ever come across! on the ride we had a miss hap and broke the black plastic foot well. the owner tried charging us for the entire back plastic as well. the owner said she doesn't jimmy rig her atv's mean while it wasn't until after the ride we noticed 6 plugs in the side wall of a tire. this is a huge no no and could cause the tire to blow. when we mentioned this to the owner she said we aren't talking about that atv, we are talking about the one you damaged. we expressed she put our life in danger when she allowed her company to operate this atv. she finally said it was her only choice because a new tire was on backorder. but they dont jimmy rig stuff right? the drive even warned us on the way back from the ride, they were going to try and get all they can. he also proceeded to tell us about all his legal problems which was pretty unprofessional. he also told us in the same atv with the plugs they have the wrong transmission bolt on it to along with a list of other things he could tell us. the driver told us how he and jim (the owners husband) were saying can you believe she is trying to charge them for all that. so they both knew what she was trying to do was unethical. if you care about your family's safety please avoid this place like the plague!!!!!"
5-star,1,celebrating my birthday and wanted to do something outside the box. this was it!!! there is no group of atv riders you have to keep up with. each reservation gets their own guide which is amazing for me since i'm terrified of anything slightly dangerous. jacob our guide was encouraging and extremely knowledgeable about the area. at every rest break i learned more about the city that is only known for casinos and drinking. such a good experience!
5-star,1,"its about time i write a review about this experience before it gets lost. we did it in early may for my bachelor party with a group of 8 guys. they also gave me a card which was a nice touch! if you on a bachelor party and want something to do other than your standard vegas pool parties, strip clubs (save it for the night), gambling, shooting range....check this place out and ride some atvs! these guys do a great job setting everything up and they will do pick ups and drop offs as well which was super convenient for us if you schedule them. jim is a funny guy with great stories and knows a ton of history about vegas. he was once a driver and met some famous people. he shared with us some cool stories on the way to the site and kept us entertained. he would point different sightings on the way there and tell us about them. they fit you with helmets, gloves and make sure all the equipment is good. they teach you how to ride the atvs....easy. it was our first time doing it and they don't rush you. our atv tour was awesome and the front and back man made sure everything was well. there were a few hiccups here and there that were quickly taken care of and they taught us how to rock ourselves into gear if the atv stalled out or wouldn't start. the scenery of the dessert and mountains were awesome and the day was beautiful. the course was perfect for us beginners, it had some mild terrain and some challenging ones as well to keep our adrenaline going. we took a break during our tour and they provided us with water. you do get plenty dirty during the trip but who cares, as long as you have a good time getting dirty. just follow the rules and you will have a great time! we don't get this kind of action in ny so i would definitely recommend this activity to anyone going out to vegas to have a good time. they won't disappoint!"
5-star,1,"what an experience! my family and i had a wonderful time! we all were first timers, beautiful views, felt safe, followed instructions, and i we all would do it again. we are from san francisco, ca and for all of us to experience something like this was totally out of our eliment. hopefully the next time we will invite our large family."
5-star,1,"jim and kim at above all atv tours and watercraft rentals are amazing! they were able to squeeze us in for a tour the same day. i was extremely impressed when we arrived at the office and kim was listening to k-love. i felt like i was home. (kim, i hope that your foot is doing better) the whole team is very friendly. jim (the husband of 32 years, the hired help and tour guide) (lol) was an exceptional tour guide. he not only knows almost everything about vegas; he knows so much about the desert as well. he took us on a fantastic tour. we were able to see joshua trees among other things. this tour was the icing on the cake for my vegas trip and i would not only recommend it to anyone. i am recommending it to everyone. i look forward to taking this tour every year. if you want a fantastic experience, go see jim and kim at above all atv tours and watercraft rentals."
1-star,0,"dreadful experience... please keep in mind that i am a small business owner and i am always in support of small businesses. we purchased a deal for two on living social, and of course tried to call and schedule a time for our tour. we were a group of 5 and purchased two deals with the intent of paying full price for the 5th. from the 1st conversation, the owner kim seemed a little upset that we were using the voucher. the rule was no more than two per group, so we weren't asking for anything special. she went on to talk about how the voucher is causing her to lose money and so on. she was very nice and as a fellow business owner i could see her point of view. as a customer it was highly inappropriate for her to mention that. if she was losing money, she should have removed it from living social. we finally schedule and agree to pay the $50 for them to pick us up. again, kim was very nice and i thought she was great. this was my first time riding along with one other in the group so we were a little nervous. she reassured that the tour leader would go at our pace. during the ride kim received a phone call from someone who we later found out was her son. in his defense he did not know he was on speaker phone, but still he asked were there any fat people and were there any hard asses. now i get the need to know sizes to make sure you have the right equipment but that was highly unprofessional and could have been worded very differently. kim did let him know that he was on speaker after that and the convo went on to progress about what bikes he needed to pull. already we were all being patient by not addressing what was said. when we get to the site, the son jim had a horrible attitude. once we got on our bikes and he started his instructions he started out with ""i'm a lenient guy but don't piss me off"". there was no reason at all for this unprofessionalism. he went on to explain he sprained his ankle and he was clearly in pain. for whatever reason he wore his flip flops. i'm not a professional, but i know that is not the proper shoe to wear for atv. with all that being said, as a business owner, i would have explained that the tour could not happen due to an injury, and refunded the money problem solved. instead they decided to push forward. still no one in the group addressed the nasty attitude and language used. we started on a trial course; during the course one of the novelists was having trouble clearly. instead of really working with her, he shouted out directions and we began the trail soon after. about 10 minutes in an atv flipped over. i was in front so i don't what happened exactly. someone stopped abruptly on a hill and it rolled. the atv and rider appeared fine and we kept pushing on for about 35 more minutes. during this ride, apparently jim was yelling behind him ""tell him to knock it the fuck off"". if you are addressing a problem you should stop and address it with that person. we were never told that we had to stay in the same position as when we started out. we were told no racing, no doughnuts and that was fine. we had two couples together so when one of the girls would fall behind, her significant other would slow to make sure they were ok. we were then told the tour was cut short because we weren't listening by not staying in line. the group was addressed once as a whole when the bike was rolled and that was it. never once were we told that we had to stay in one single file line and not change. i am a very quiet person and if i'm wrong i will never try to argue against it. but, obviously jim didn't want to be out there and used any excuse to cut his day short. it didn't make sense that this is how they would treat customers and it came back to the living social voucher. this is where i began to get upset and i explained that i will be writing a review about our experience and i gave her the same advice i added in this review. if you can't be professional at work stay home. this sat her off and words begin to exchange, this was the first time i noted kim being unprofessional which shocked me. once i told her what her son said she began to get upset with him because i said it was all going in the review. at some point her husband showed up and begins yelling and screaming and it was just a very bad scene that could have escalated so much more. needless to say we had a horrible experience all because someone was having a bad and painful day. i can empathize with that truly, and he was clearly in pain. but someone should have decided that instead trying to collect that money; they should have cancelled the tour in the beginning and called it a day. sorry for the long review, i tried to cut it short, but i wanted to be fairto the business. the trail was nice and kim was great up until the end. i truly believe it was a bad day and i hope they learn so that next time the situation can be avoided."
5-star,1,"our guide james was awesome! atvs were easy to learn, trail was a ton of fun! would definitely recommend. we won't go back to vegas without going on another ride with above all las vegas!"
5-star,1,"highlight of our trip to las vegas! we had a great time doing the atv tour! a great way to spend a morning away from the hustle and bustle. nice, newer atv's and very nice people to deal with. our guide was knowledgeable, friendly, and patient."
1-star,0,"owners started out great. it was the end of jetski season so they gave us a lower rate and even lowered our deposit. because it was the end of season though the skis were pretty beat up. lots of scuffs, missing mirrors, lots of scrapes. she already had the damage report done when we got there and there was clearly a mark on her paper for damage on the rear corner. when we returned the jetskis they claimed we caused that damage and charged us $100. i tried to talk to her about it showing her son there was already a mark on the sheet in that spot but went nowhere. if you decide to rent from this place take ur own pictures of the damage because they won't be able to find the pictures they already have of them."
5-star,1,"james was a great tour guide! we really had a good time. it was the first time for the kids, 6 and 7, but james made it enjoyable for all of us. he was knowledgeable of the trail and equipment. the trail was fun too; nice bumps, dips and straightaways. i would recommend this company for atv rides. we took a two hour ride in the am and it was perfect!"
5-star,1,"i was looking for activities to do for our large group (6 ppl) in vegas while on vacation and came across above all las vegas atv tours while on groupon.... purchased the deal for a 2-hr tour and loved it! customer service is beyond great, atvs were a blast to ride, and the desert scenery was incredible! i am a first-time atv rider and our instructors/tour guides explained everything in detail! out group loved this adventure and i will definitely be doing this again when in vegas!! **one recommendation that we made to our guides was to get gopro cameras for the rides!** the best!!"
5-star,1,"great service, communication and mostly importantly people (& atvs:))! kim and jim were great hosts and really made an effort to accommodate our stag party. the atvs were well maintained and jim was even nice enough to stop by in and out burgers before dropping us off at the hotel so we didn't need to take a cab to try the place out. highly recommended. will definitely be back!"
5-star,1,"i was looking for something to do with my daughter's (15 year old) boyfriend while she was hanging out with her soccer teammates at the unlv tour. above all was the only atv rental in the area that allowed someone under 16 to ride by themselves when i called to confirm kim said we think no one should be left out and have atvs for as little as 6 year olds. we were supposed to go out on a tour just the pair of us and the guide and when we got to the shop to do the paperwork found out our guide hurt his leg and was unable to do the tour so we would be part of another tour with 4 other riders. we were the only riders without experience. we drove out to the canyon and were given a quick lesson on the atv and we were off. about ten mins in one of the other rider's tipped her atv and while she was fine she slowed down the ride. my daughter's boyfriend and i were able to keep up with the guide and for having no experience the guide told us a few times how great we were doing. it was a little annoying to have to slow down or even stop and wait for the rest of the group (lady that fell off earlier) to catch up other than that we had a great time and really enjoyed the ride. it is mentioned and should be a given but i will say it again you will be riding out in a dusty canyon, there is no point in looking cute, you won't after it is all over. i got points for being the best girlfriend's mom ever! i would recommend above all to anyone wanting something fun to do for an afternoon."
5-star,1,"i love it when i find an experience in las vegas that shows me a new side to nevada. the atv experience was great. james went slow enough for people like me, who want to look at flowers and rock formations, as well as fast enough for people like my husband, who couldn't care less how many gorgeous flowers and butterflies we saw. when people ask me for suggestions, i'm definitely putting this company at the top of the list. it was a great way to see el dorado box canyon!"
5-star,1,"my group and i just got back from above all atv tour of el dorado canyon after all our other friends bailed. gotta say, they missed out on an amazing time. if you're looking to go balls to the walls through the canyon and put some mud on your big kids pants, you gotta come here. we bought a living social deal that was $124 for 2 people for 2 hours... what a deal!!! we saw advertisements at the store and they're always running specials, so even if the living social deal is gone, they might have other deals. we met up with kim, the owner, off her lake mead office to sign waivers and pay a minimal $10 tax fee and she immediately led us to the atv site off searchlight. they provide gear for you, only recommendation would be to bring a handkerchief to cover your face. james gave us instructions for about ten minutes and took us for a test run and he didn't cut time out from our actual ride for that. james has been riding for nearly 15 years so he's really good at assessing abilities. our group picked it up really fast so we were able to go through lots of hills and bumpy terrain.. it was awesome!!! i can't wait to bring more people back. this is the cheapest atv tour i've found in las vegas and definitely not lacking in quality, friendliness, or professionalism. so much fun, you won't regret it"
5-star,1,"4 of us guys on a bachelor party in vegas had an awesome experience with the atv's here. our guide was james, who's the son the of the business owner. incredible guy. very knowledgeable, helpful and an all round fun guy to be around. he picked us up from our hotel and took us to the shop to complete some paperwork, then drove us to the terrain. tbh, it's a little on the expensive side but that's because it's vegas. the other guide, richard, was also very cool. the ride itself was amazing. it took me about 10 minutes to get adjusted to the manually geared atv (which is more fun than the automatic one's), but once the learning curve was over it was sheer enjoyment. the bumps are what makes the whole thing fun. a couple of members of the group slowed us down somewhat but that's to be expected in a group. james leads the group and richard brings up the rear. both are experienced riders and always keep an eye out on the group. james is really good at it. he seems to have eyes at the back of his head, because he can spot issues with the most distant, last rider and rushes back to help. to be able to keep an eye out like that on the entire group is not easy. be careful with the atv's because if you break a taillight or something you'll have to pay for it. but, if you follow the rules and once you get used to the bumpy ride, you should be fine. after the group tour was over, the 4 of us requested james to take us out for another hour along a different trail. he was very tired, obviously, but still agreed and gave us a good deal with the additional fees. he took us along a trail we really enjoyed and could speed on. he and richard never forgot that even though if was just the 4 of us they were taking out, our safety was still their concern. he even managed to pick a part of a trail where we sighted some big horn mountain sheep. tame creatures. most unbothered about human companions. all in all, it was a very joyous outing, made even more enjoyable by james. james - thanks for the suggestion on the ahem ""adult "" fun places ;)"
5-star,1,"about a week ago, 5 guys and myself went on a 2 hour guided atv tour through eldorado canyon with above all atv rentals. the experience was fantastic! above all is certainly a family run establishment, with a similar look and feel, but don't let that drive you elsewhere. kim, the proprietor, runs a tight ship, with great tour guides, well maintained equipment, and low prices. when i first talked to kim, it took her a while to convince me that a ""guided tour"" would be exciting. but, after experiencing it first hand, i can tell you that when she says ""guided tour"", she doesn't mean putting along learning about wildlife and taking pictures of blooming cacti (although, i'm sure you could ask for it). our guide james, who formerly competed in motocross, took us over the trails best suited to our abilities, as fast as we could manage. - i have not driven an atv in a long time, and many in our party had never operated one, but we were still flying along. to give you an idea of what to expect on a guided tour (you can also just rent an atv without a tour). once you get into above all atv, you will need to fill out some waivers and pay. afterwards, you may either follow your guide in your own car or ride in the guide's car out to the tour site. (in our case, we followed the guide in our own car, which meant we got to leave as soon as we were done riding, instead of waiting for the guide to clean and shelve our equipment.) at the tour site, the guide asked us for our atv preferences, and brought out a few models. we were then given safety equipment (gloves, helmet, goggles), iced water, and instructions as to how to operate the different vehicles. to warm-up, we spent about 10 minutes doing loops on a practice course. finally, we left for the canyon. while riding through the canyon, our tour guide was impeccable: he somehow managed to keep riding while repeatedly looking back to check on us no matter how fast we were going. he clearly knew the trails like the back of his hand and chose them so they got increasingly more challenging. in the beginning of the ride, when we were still adjusting, he used his atv to skillfully pick-off large rocks from the trail that would cause us problems. occasionally during the ride, we would pause to take water breaks and enjoy the scenery long enough to regain blood flow to our arms and legs. at the end of the tour, we were given more refreshing water, and clean, ice-cold towelettes - which made it easier to see the huge smiles hidden behind the dirt on our faces. while i haven't tried the other las vegas atv offerings, and therefore don't have a great base of comparison, i must say that i cannot imagine having had a better time. kim, james, and the staff at above all were fantastic. beyond the review i have two tips: 1. if you want to drive something fast, off-road, forget about the dune-buggies, they're unreliable. go atving instead. 2. after atving, you will be sore (maybe for a few days), so plan out your trip accordingly."
4-star,1,"for our anniversary a few years back, we decided to rent atv's and go out riding. our experience levels are pretty different. my wife had never been on an atv before, and i got my first one when i was 6. i rode all the time when i was a kid, but hadn't been on one in about 15 years. after doing our research, we contacted kim at above all atv and booked a private tour. (it was called something else then, but it's the same people) we booked a package that included 2 hours with 2 atv's, safety gear, and a tour guide to show us the ropes. the equipment was top notch, and the safety gear was all nice and well kept. after a brief ""get to know you"" session, the guide took me out for some practice runs for about 15 minutes to get me used to being on board again, and then we went back and grabbed jena, he spent the whole 2 hours with her, puttering around and getting her comfortable with the ride, and i tooled all over the place, driving circles around them. i'd ride about 1/2 mile in front of them, and then turn around and race as fast as i could to about 1/2 mile behind them, and then come back and putter along with them for a while before taking off again. it was the most fun and the most damned exercise we've ever done together. we couldn't wipe the smiles off of our faces, and by dinner that night, we couldn't lift our forks we were so sore. best day ever! since then, we've had a baby, and it's hard for us to get away for a day to be able to ride, but i guarantee you that sooner or later we will book another day in the desert, and when we do, above all atv's is who we will call. it was insane how much fun we had that day, and we still talk about it now. these guys offer a great package at an affordable price. if you are even considering it, call them. you won't be sorry."
5-star,1,"this place was amazing!! they gave me a quote over the phone, got me in quickly and did my car in a short amount of time. they even told me i could wait a little bit longer on changing the houses but i decided to get them done right away. they came highly recommended and i will always go there from now on"
5-star,1,"sean reached out to me in a facebook group when i was looking for recommendations for a mechanic in the area. he expressed to me that ace prides themselves in being female friendly, as my concern was going to a new mechanic as a female in her twenties. he was even able to schedule me right away and work with my schedule! i went in for an oil change and was out very quickly! there was no upselling, or ""recommended"" repairs, and i never felt pressured. staff was very courteous and friendly, and the waiting room was clean and comfortable. i'm so glad to have a mechanic that i can trust in the area!"
5-star,1,"i have been using ace for both of my cars for years now. i highly recommend these guys. they give great service at a great price. i never have to come back with problems later, and always feel like they're straight with me on what needs to be fixed. i don't even live nearby, but the extra distance is well worth the service i get from ace. thanks guys."
5-star,1,love this ace performance automotive repair shop. honest and fast service and friendly people too! will not go anywhere else! we have been coming here for over 15 years and feel they are the best!!!! jamie is the best too!!!
5-star,1,i gave ace performance automotive complete discretion to find the perfect wheels and tires to dress up my new 2018 honda accord. they did an amazing job. great customer service and awesome prices! highly recommend!
5-star,1,i was referred to ace performance automotive by a friend who has been a customer of theirs for the past few years. i had an excellent first experience with everyone i came into contact with there. they were able to quickly schedule my repair and completed the work on schedule. their rates are fair and the quality of work is very high! i recommend ace performance automotive to everyone now! they have earned my loyalty!
5-star,1,"nothing but the best from these guys. sean is the bomb!! i had the chance to see these guys in action back in the shop, no red flags, all was on the up and up and professional. i will only take my vehicles there from now on. i read the neg reviews on this this site, i would love to hear what ""really"" happened, i just cant see sean and his team doing what these people claimed."
5-star,1,these guys are as good as it gets. i have taken several cars to them including my daughters. their knowledge and service is incredible. they went over and above to take care of us. if you are looking for a good shop this is the only one i would recommend!!
1-star,0,"took my car in on thursday night, for check engine light, the free test at the auto store stated possible throttle body, so i got the car back monday night. took of for lunch to get my emissions done and the check engine light came back on the idle was 1800 rpm,. took the car back the next day so they could look at it, another couple of hours of missed work now finally they forgot to learn the car about the new throttle body, ok were off and running, took the car i the next day, crap, past my due date now for emissions, more fees and another couple of hours missed from work, but heck no check engine light, guess it was good for only 2 more days, and now it's still on. texted sean about the problem and still no reply it's only been 2 weeks now. summary when i went to pick up the car, there were spills running down the windshield soda? and the cover for the engine was in the back seat, oil and grease now in my back seats, so i had to wait to get the cover on. ** summary ** spent well over $500 bucks, missed about 6 hours of work and had to pay for a lyft to get to work for 2 days and the check engine light is still on and the there is grease or oil stain on my back seat. i felt and shared with sean this experience was completely un- professional, that experience might slide if the car worked...."
5-star,1,i had a great experience at ace performance. i was in and out in about 45 min. and my truck is running great. if your looking for an honest mechanic at a great price then take the time to check out ace performance.
5-star,1,thank you sean and kelly for great service! you got us in same day and beat the big box competitor by hundreds! thanks for honest solid work!
5-star,1,"today was my second visit to ace automotive, could not have been a better experience. i arrived 10 minutes before they opened, only to find the front door open as i walked in i was instantly greeted with a friendly smile. we explained the problem and without a second thought he went out to check on the car, turned out to be a very simple fix. he recommended what we do, we did it and couldn't be happier. very honest business, am thankful we found them. two thumbs up from me!!"
5-star,1,we've been taking our cars here for years after they were recommended by a friend. we've always received friendly service at a fair price. my husband is very picky about who works on his car and he's been very satisfied with their knowledge and service all this time.
5-star,1,you know many people don't take this yelp thing seriously but fortunately this place does. i don't want to go into details for the sake of business integrity but the owner called me personally and truly went out of his way to make things right. i will bring my business here again and if it is as good as the owner brings this time i will recommend many to come here.
5-star,1,"jamie and his staff at ace automotive are great! i've taken multiple vehicles in to get serviced and they get it done quick, they get it done right, and they get it done at a price that's fair! friendly service and quality work, you couldn't ask for more! the next time your vehicle needs serviced go see jamie and his crew, they will take care of you!"
5-star,1,"i have been very impressed by ace automotive. they were able to fix a brake issue that 3-4 other mechanics/shops over the past couple years haven't been able to fix, the errors would just come right back. ace fixed this and their service has been top notch. i'm very pleased and impressed with these guys!"
5-star,1,"as a single woman, i have had plenty of auto repair shops nickle and dime me to death. i was referred to ace by another single friend of mine. i have been with ace for nearly three years now. i have never been so satisfied with their work and prices. i have just given their name to three of my co-workers looking for a good reputable company. i highly recommend ace automotive!"
1-star,0,"i have gone to ace for a few years now and have always had great service. but recently i took my lincoln ls in to have quite a few things fixed on it. scott and jamie are great guys and i believe they did a good job. they kept me in the know about everything. but at one point they said they wanted to replace the hose connecting to the hydraulic fan reservoir. they special made one because they said it wasn't available to order. it seemed like a solid deal i paid and left relieved knowing my car had been in good hands. the next day as i was idling my car suddenly overheated causing the coolant reservoir to bust (not the hydraulic fan reservoir.) i lifted the hood and saw that the hydraulic fan reservoir was bone dry. i had my father come pick me up and confirm it as well. anyway i call ace they get the car and tell me it will be another 400 dollars to fix what just broke, which was the coolant reservoir. unbeknownst to me the whole reason the car over heated and busted the coolant tank was because the hose they made to the hydraulic fan tank was leaking. they put in a new coolant tank gave me back the car and told me it was good. the next morning i found out about the leak and confronted them about it. they had looked the car over and gave it back to me without even realizing a part they put on was leaking. they were kind enough to fix the leak and seemed contrite. but when i asked for my 400 dollars back for paying for the new coolant tank seeing as how it was their negligence that caused the car to over heat and bust that reservoir. they said it was an old tank and that was the only reason it busted. i later went to the lincoln dealership and they confirmed my suspicions. ace automotive caused my car to overheat because they didn't have a hose fully fastened and when i needed it fixed they charged me for it. i have taken my car, my girlfriends car, my mom, my sister and even my grandma's car there. but i will not return i appreciate them fixing the leak, but to not stand behind your work and return someone's money when you know it was your negligence that caused it is a gross misconduct in my opinion."
5-star,1,"honest (you dont always find that in the car repair business) reliable, friendly, professional, timely, reasonable. jamie is the best! would not take my car anywhere else :)"
5-star,1,ace automotive was great. i will definitely be back. i took my jaguar there for a second opinion after grulich's quoted $868 for leaking coolant and malfunctioning sensor. ace put it under pressure for 1.5 hours and found no leak. they topped off the coolant for free. great service. will be back!
5-star,1,"a pretty good auto shop that offers free inspections. they're quite quick as well, as both times i went there they immediately started the inspection and gave me a quote afterwards. the shop owner seems like he's pretty on top of things as well. i like how he explains things as he goes along. i got my radiator/hoses replaced here for about $350, which is pretty reasonable. it only took about 3 hours as well."
5-star,1,"the most important thing to me when picking an auto repair shop is i want to feel i'm treated honestly. i felt jamie armstrong was honest with me. he told me which repairs were a potential safety issue and which were just annoyances that could more easily be left indefinitely. jamie is also one of the most friendly guys i've met. the repair did take longer than i'd anticipated, but i did have them do extra stuff which wasn't on the list when i dropped the car off. i will definitely keep ace in mind for future auto repairs."
1-star,0,"avoid at all costs. nightmare. their bad oil change cost me a blown engine on my mercedes. they refused to take responsibility initially until i threatened small claims lawsuit. they overtightened cap on my oil pan, cracked it and all my oil leaked out. caused engine to blow. $10,000 repair later and needed new engine. difficult to resolve the issue with. initially unwilling to accept fault. they made a settlement claim for the majority of damages but still took my money and offered no accountability, no remorse and offered no apology or refund to the damages sustained. avoid avoid avoid avoid."
1-star,0,bad brake job. manager would not even want to talk about it...nor head office when e-mailed. avoid this dishonest location and company.
1-star,0,needed new tires in summer of 2014 for our forerunner and got them here. returned november 2015 screw in tire. they told me that the screw was in a place that did not allow repair and we would need a new tire and also would need a match on the other side for balance and wear. left and went for advice to our own mechanic. he investigated and found the screw was small and had not caused a leak. no charge. be careful dealing with these guys.
1-star,0,do not go here! these guys are lying scum - especially the manager. i dropped my car off to get the tires changed and when i come to pick it up they tell me they had to replace something that had seized up in the wheel. i'm no expert on mechanics however i do know now that they should have asked my permission before doing any supposed additional work on my car. live and learn. please do not go here if you don't want to be ripped off. if everyone used yelp and saw all the horrible reviews then this place will go out of business.
1-star,0,"took the car in for an emissions test. so far so good. suddenly asked to spend $500 for an additional test because my engine light was not working. i told the manager that i did not understand and would seek a second option. later as i picked up the car proceeded to tell the manager that he did not have good communications skills as i still did not get how an emissions test would wind up with an additional $500 test plus any ""new"" mechanical needs. he is now shouting at me (i did shout back) and is now bringing people up front to join in... get out of of here you $#@$# and take your $@#$# car with you. again something about poor communication skills when you are being asked to fork out an additional $1,000 or more. hoped i had checked yelp before going there (it was close)"
1-star,0,"this place is a scam. i brought my car, got a quote and when i came back to pick it up the service bill was more than double. they never asked my approval for doing services that were not asked or quoted for. then they said they would not return my car until the amount was paid. a real scam. stay away from them."
1-star,0,"please don't go here or any ag&r (another location in aurora does the same scamming also) . if i could give a zero i would. i went here because my coolant was leaking a little. i know about cars even though i am a woman, and i think they saw a women and thought they could rip me off. i said for them to check the thermostat and the housing around it. once one technician check it i was told it would cost approx $350 not including the diagnosis because i need a new thermostat. i couldn't afford that so i said no thanks and i will try and get my car up to my dads. (he is my usual mechanic but i didn't want to risk the drive up) once i came back to get my car a second technician proceeded to say i now all of a sudden had a severe leak and i shouldn't be driving it at all. (trying to pressure me into getting the work done immediately) i left and took it to my dad, who is only a car-enthusiast. i managed to get, my car 50km to my dads and only saw my thermometer exceed the normal temperature once. so they lied again. verdict - my thermost wasn't broken at all. all it required was a new hose which cost $16.64 and an ""o' ring to adhere it. my dad tested my thermostat mutiple times and it was working fine. i will not be going back here ever again. i can't trust them anymore. i hate being taken advantage of and maybe this happened because i am a lady, but i doubt it as my dad noticed issues at the aurora location also and he has rebuilt and fixed many cars in his lifetime."
1-star,0,"avoid at all costs. workmanship is dubious to say the least. they do not do the agreed work. ie tire change-over with balancing. they do not balance the wheels (but they charge you). also, wheel lugs not tightened! beware. if you do use them, check the lugs...it could save you your life."
1-star,0,"do not go here!!! i went to active green & ross and bought winter tires and rims for my range rover. it cost nearly $4k for the 20"" tires and rims but they perform extremely well and look great. i went back at the first snow to get them put on and the tire pressure monitor system was reporting a fault. they told me i just needed to drive it for 15 minutes at 50km/hr. the warning never went away though so i took it back. they told me again to just drive it some more. the fault still didn't go away so i took it back to my dealer who said that agr had installed the wrong tire pressure monitors. my dealer charged me $75 for the diagnosis. so i went back to agr and they claimed that they did everything by the book but they would install the recommended monitors and charge me the difference. another $150. all the while the agr employees treated me rudely such as telling me to move my car and then telling me that i put it in the wrong place and move it again. it's not about the money. what really gets me is that they didn't do their homework and had three chances to catch this or at least call land rover for themselves. they have wasted so much of my time. all i wanted was a ""sorry for the hassle."" i guess that was too much for them. don't even consider buying tires from active green & ross unless you have a lot of time and money to waste. these guys are a bad joke."
1-star,0,"took my car in for winter tires. bought the whole rim and tire pakage with them, the price is fair and they seem nice and knowledgeable enough. everything goes wrong from here. first they are a whole hour late at the time they promised me, made me sit there and wait. second, they don't know what they are doing with my car's tire pressure sensor and screwed it up. i drive in again next day to have it reset and they made me wait for another hour! i think when you didn't do it properly the first time, you should give extra attention to your paid customer. now they still can't set it right as they promised and ask me to bring my summer tires in so they can figure out how to set it. the trouble aside, i didn't even get a sorry from them."
4-star,1,"most people would fret at first when they brought their value-decreasing car into any mechanics. everyone has heard of someone being ripped off. now i dont know whether it has something to do with the fact that they are a well known company and have a corporate image to uphold, but every time i went inside to get an oil change they were always very efficient and polite. they also spent the time explaining to me what was wrong beyond an oil change and would outline for me the pros and cons of doing a repair. if for example i didnt need a repair done right away theyd say as much. i know that theyll look for whatever they can do, whatever needs fixing, but never did i take it there, get something fixed and have a problem afterwards."
1-star,0,"we just had a terrible service experience at this dealership. brought in our mdx for an oil change before leaving to return to our home after our stay in scottsdale. we had our acura in for an oil change and overall check at our local dealership at home but after three months decided to change the oil and have everything checked again. j.d., the service manager, told us we needed a long list of things done. naively, we agreed and the bill came to over $1,000. he even said the coolant system did not need flushing but included that to the tune of $200. we are an older couple and we feel we were oversold and overcharged and taken advantage of as we have always meticulously maintained our vehicle. jd was slick, insisting even the steering wheel fluid had to be changed out, and insisted nothing could wait until we returned home. he said it would be an hour and a half wait but it took over three hours. at one point he said our car was just being washed but then it was another hour until he returned it. the cashier said we received $100 off but this was not indicatedon the bill. it was just anotherin a series of lies. beware and stay away from this dealership. they are neither fair nor honest. as an update, mr farnsworth called to review our experience. he was exceedingly cordial and understanding. he agreed to reimburse the cost of the coolant replacement as he determined the service was not warranted. we appreciated his consideration and action."
5-star,1,"i purchased my one year old acura from ray ryan. of all the car salesmen i have had over many years, he was by far the most professional, cordial, honest, and competent. after the sale, he was most helpful when i had a minor issue with my car."
2-star,0,"sadly, we did not have a positive experience. in the process of shopping for a newer vehicle we wanted to check out a certified acura mdx to see if it made our shortlist. plamen, the sales guy, was initially very nice. he was kind enough to bring us mints after i mentioned that we'd just eaten greek food and apologized if we smelt of garlic. however, once he knew we were researching vehicles and not necessarily going to buy that day, it felt like his attitude changed. on the relatively short test drive he had us change drivers on a section of road works with traffic passing by - we usually pull off into a parking lot for safety. what really turned us off was after we got back we asked to look under the hood. he looked directly at me and made some remark about why i was bothering to look there. both my husband and i were taken aback as he said it seriously and did not smile, so it didn't appear to be a joke. frankly, we thought it was rude and unnecessary. eventually he made a comment about going to help customers who were looking to buy today before he walked off. maybe he was having an off day or short on his sales target but that is still no excuse. thankfully, the next dealership we visited made up for it by making us feel welcome and going out of their way to help us and answer our questions. awesome test drive too! that's the kind of service that earns business, not the one we encountered here."
1-star,0,called three times for service appointment. put on hold for a long time. if they can't answer the phone can you imagine what the service would be like?
1-star,0,"disappointed. walked in to buy the ilx i leased from a different dealership and was turned away. the sales manager was busy talking to a friend and told me to try back tomorrow. i asked to set up an appointment or a time i can meet with someone who can sell me the car. they didn't know who was working the next day and to try walking in again. most car salesmen jump at any opportunity, this place seemed happy to push me out the door."
5-star,1,matthew and charles are real professionals. my car deal was done the right way in an hour and a half. this was easily the best car buying process i've ever been associated with. and i've had some bad experiences and considered on buying from private party because i've had such terrible experiences at other dealers. matthew and charles will be the next guy's eye contact when i'm ready to buy a new car again.
5-star,1,i had the pleasure meeting sandrena; she helped me with my new car purchase. i absolutely recommend her with any of your new car purchases. she was very delightful and very knowledgeable when it came to my car questions. everyone there is friendly and they really work with you when buying a new car. randy the gm was great and helped me get into a new acura mdx.
5-star,1,"the entire team at acura north scottsdale was a pleasure to work with. ray ryan is a great car salesman, and i truly appreciated his ""no drama"" approach to car sales! i never felt as though i was being pushed into a car or felt that the dealership had any hidden agendas. their pricing was more than fair and they made my car buying experience not only painless - but also enjoyable! i would highly recommend ray and acura north scottsdale to anyone looking for a new luxury car."
5-star,1,"i purchased a new 2017 mdx hybrid suv at this dealer. it has all the features and excellent performance i was looking for. i traded in a lexus suv and an audi a7 as i wanted to get down to one car. i am very pleased with my choice in the mdx as it has more luxury and performance than the 2007 lexus and just about the same performance as the audi with more safety features. my shopping and purchase experience was excellent. i'm a senior citizen and have bought and sold lots of cars. i rate my experience with this dealer as the best i can remember. my sales exec ray ryan was extremely helpful, friendly and knowledgeable. i went to the mercedes dealer prior to acura and their offer on my trades was substantially less. the sales manager and their account and service teams were also friendly and helpful in getting my car equipped and ready the way i wanted. in sum, i love the car and the dealer experience was beyond my expectations, even for a luxury brand."
5-star,1,"i typically don't do reviews unless i've had terrible service however this time was great! i made an appt with plamen who by the way is a great salesman. he is not your typical salesman. he makes you feel like you're family. very knowledge and if he doesn't know the answer he will find out. he made sure i was satisfied with my purchase before leaving and followed up with me the next day. the finance manager terres was amazing! i've never met a more friendly, energetic person. keep in mind i was her last customer of the night. she made me feel like i was her 1st! her willingness to help you goes way and beyond what she is required to do. she is quick (which we all love after being at the dealership all day) professional and just a great spirit to be around. the next car i buy will definitely be from here....as long as plamen and terres is around."
5-star,1,"summer haring has been my service advisor, for a few years now. she is very low key, and easy to work with, and knows her auto business. i highly recommend her."
5-star,1,"my mdx is approaching 4 yrs old- end of warrantee. i have shopped other area dealerships of luxury level cars. for the most part, with exceptions, zoos. but for 4 years i have been a penske customer. my salesman, rob zullo of tenafly,n.j. has always been an honest gentleman with me. my service rep, summer. is superb. for 4 years i have been treated as if i was a customer of a fine specialty store. even while waiting for an oil change,visiting any of the penske showrooms, you are greeted then left alone if you want. penske obviously wants a high standard of customer service- and it shows. 4 years of consistent treatment. my 2018 will be from penske. make?- decisions, decisions."
1-star,0,"initially i had left five stars because i had a great experience. since then, they had lost my registration and gave me an in accurate license plate. purchased my car in december 2016 and now it is may 2017 and my registration is due. they did not give me an option to do a full year registration and now i have to pay to register my vehicle which is unexpected expenses for me. very upset with how this was handled. if you purchase a car here make sure you ensure your registration and plates are accurate."
5-star,1,"i really enjoyed my used car purchase there. had been looking for an 08/09 4wd 4runner for quite awhile and found one here. i was impressed with the preparedness of my salesperson kelly right off the bat. called in to confirm availability and set an appointment after i finished my own homework. she had the car and folder waiting for me with the carfax and kbb reports so we were already on the same page. we spoke openly after inspecting the car and test drive about my pros and cons whether to buy. once we finished that conversation the negotiation was realistic, brief and respectful. then came the next step to finance and i found terres to be just as great to work with. she made that tedious task almost fun...go figure how that can happen. all in all i can definitely recommend checking out the dealership and name dropping for both kelly and terres."
5-star,1,"always been an acura owner since 1993 (legend, 2 tls, 1 tsx). the service at north scottsdale continues to be excellent. recently i had my 2012 tl in for a routine oil change and their service technician found a leak in the transmission seal. they were quick to disclose their findings, arrange for a courtesy car and begin the repair. the service advisors (zsofia and summer ) have also been excellent at keeping me updated on the progress and informing me of any changes that might need my approval. you can feel confident that the job will be done right and if there are any follow-up concerns that they will address them promptly and quickly. north scottsdale acura is the one you can trust."
5-star,1,"i worked with chris h. he did everything in his power to make my experience as painless as possible. chris, charles and terres were efficient and very conscientious of my time situation, having all the paperwork ready to go before i ever walked in the door on the day i actually purchased my mdx. chris has the patience of a saint. a definite asset to the dealership. a huge thank you to all of you."
5-star,1,"the service department is always so dedicated to making your experience a great one! my first call in to schedule my first service was a little questionable, i wasn't sure how it would go. it seemed like the person booking my appointment wasn't quite sure about the availability of a loaner car and that is a very big deal for me. however, i was assigned a service representative, matt. he has gone above and beyond, impressed me speechless and i couldn't be happier with the service!! there is one thing that stands out the most to me. matt is honest about what my vehicle needs, for once i didn't feel like the dealership was taking advantage of me on rates or service recommendations. he actually told me how long i had left for each item. i did choose to fix it now anyways... but the point is i never felt an ""upsale"" tactic to get more money! they also go out of their way to handle warranty items and make sure my car is in tip top shape. did i mention i got a complementary car detail for trusting them to handle my 30k mile services?? there are some other beautiful cars on the road that i have loved for years and one day hoped to own. however, i may be an acura owner for the next 20 years with service like this!!! thanks matt for taking such great care of me and making my experience smooth and stress free."
5-star,1,"i recently had to bring my acura rdx in to acura north scottsdale to have my takata air bag replaced. i worked with matt williams and everything went perfectly. setting the appointment, the appointment reminder, check in, loaner car, and pick up went perfectly. thanks matt for the great experience."
1-star,0,i bought an acura in 2015 at this location. they suggested me to buy the ding protection option (paint less dent repair - pdr) and to pay more than 500 usd for the same. i asked them what are benefits of the package and they mentioned that it will cover any dings on your car. i also showed them my old car and multiple small stone marks that i had on the car front bumper and they said that the ding protection package will cover such issues fast forward to 2016 august and these guys told me that this package only covers sides of a car! i was angry as i had been given wrong information when i bought the car. i asked for refund. the finance persons agreed that i was given wrong information and tried to correct the problem. but after talking to management he said that that i cannot be refunded. he further tried to say that it is my responsibility to go through entire documentation before signing. i was going to buy one more acura from them but now i have dropped that plan. i feel cheated. i would like to have my money back.
5-star,1,"created a yelp account specifically so i could come review this dealership- honestly could not have asked for a better first time car buying experience!! from the moment i walked in, every single person i encountered in this dealership went out of their way to take care of me. after my parents had such a great experience at this dealership when buying their rdx last winter, i decided to check out acura for myself. went in on a thursday evening after work, just to look around and test drive, and ended up talking with plamen. even though he knew i would not be buying anything that day, he was patient and still took the time to show me the ilx i was interested in and all of its features, and we talked a little bit about different options and vehicles. the place was pretty busy, but he did not seem inconvenienced at all that i was taking up valuable selling time, especially at the end of the month. when i came back on saturday, i ended up buying my beautiful new ilx! every staff member, from sales with plamen to financing with terres, went absolutely above and beyond to give me the best service possible. everything was pretty straightforward and i did not feel like i was being swindled or taken advantage of at all - this was a huge relief, since i have never purchased a car before and have heard some horror stories from friends and family about their past (obviously non-acura) car-buying experiences. i am so happy that i chose to buy from acura north scottsdale! i will definitely be back!"
5-star,1,"the first time i dealt with north scottsdale acura was to take my 2003 mdx in for a factory recall. they were great and did not push me to get extra repairs i didn't need. this past spring we purchased a newer mdx from ray at acura north scottsdale. he was a pleasure to work with. very helpful and patient without being aggressive. we recently took the newer mdx in for a routine oil change, and zsofia moll, our service consultant, went above and beyond to give us great service. we will continue to bring our cars into north scottsdale acura for service."
5-star,1,"we had an outstanding experience at acura north scottsdale. after a couple of weeks of research and test driving we had narrowed our choices to three suv's. after we locked in on the 2016 mdx (white w/parchment), the rest was easy. jack worked for our business and was extremely friendly and accommodating. the atmosphere was welcoming and we were given our space, but jack was always there when needed. another acura dealer made the offer to beat the lowest price, but that's just lazy. jack was the guy putting in all the work, so it was a no brainer. much thanks to travis, assistant gm, charles in finance, and kelly who walked us through everything when jack was busy with another customer (busy day). bottom line is we couldn't be happier with our experience. professional and efficient."
5-star,1,"i was fairly sure on the used car i wanted, and found it at acura north scottsdale. as anyone, i dreaded going through the process of negotiating or being ""sold""'on things. i literally went on a lunch break to give it a whirl, and walked out within 20 minutes with an offer for my trade in and an offer sheet...no nonsense, just straight to business. i came home, discussed with the hubby, and emailed scott for more info...received an answer within 10 minutes (and that was afterhours). after a tiny bit of virtually painless negotiating, we made a deal and drove my new car home the next day. the guys at acura north scottsdale made this the easiest car purchase i have ever made! thanks rob z, mike, and scott for all of your help. completely reasonable on negotiating, and treated me fairly through the whole process. i would definitely recommend going here."
5-star,1,"received excellent customer service from mr. bob campbell when purchasing a pre-owned vehicle. very professional in following up on it with a phone call. also, ms. terres martori expedited our paper work in a speedy way so we were out before you know it enjoying our car."
5-star,1,"after visiting five different car dealers in one day, acura north scottsdale is the only one i could stomach returning to. no high pressure sales, no intimidation tactics, nothing but professional, courteous service. we dealt with both rob rossi and venna wang. they knew their product well and offered legitimate solutions to help meet our criteria for a new car. when we told them that we wanted to look at more cars, they didn't try to convince us to stay and make a deal, they simply told us to enjoy looking and that they only wanted to sell us a car if we felt it was the right one for us. the scary part is that i felt like they genuinely meant it. all of the other dealers we went to started circling like sharks when we told them we wanted to look at more cars. one of the dealers even ridiculed us and told us that we were stupid if we didn't buy their car. does that sales tactic really work? it must, because that is how half of the dealers we talked to seemed to operate. rob rossi and venna wang were both so pleasant to deal with that they made our car buying experience what it should be, fun! can't wait to trade in our other car and become a two acura family."
5-star,1,"rob zullo from internet sales and charles watson in finance took care of me. the jeep was actually very well priced, and they worked with my bad credit to get me reasonably financed. rob was straight up about the price!"
5-star,1,"the most amazing car buying experience...ever. we went in quite skeptical about the acura, with our hearts set on a bmw. we were greated by plamen who was very happy and enthusiastic about acura and helping us in general, which was a nice change, albeit alarming. we test drove a showroom tl again, skeptical as there was no way it would compare to the bmw we had our hearts set on. an hour later we were owners. not exaggerating. out the door, keys in hand in an hour. the whole team was completely amazing the nicest, best experience ever and have made us lovers of acura."
5-star,1,everyone at acura was fantastic. brian was the first person i contacted and he was great. plamen showed me the car and was very upfront and sincere. he's a great salesperson. he did not make me feel pressured into buying. even the financing was easy. chuck was able to get me a great rate on my loan. even the people not working with me were friendly and caring. i recommend this dealership.
5-star,1,"in the age of the internet, speed is everything. rocko and his team were fast, effective and won my business while the kids at tempe acura were trying to figure out their auto-responder. i inquired about the exact car i wanted one day, spent 30 minutes in the dealership the next day and drove away. thanks guys, it was a pleasure. let your execs know that at least one person in this world (me) just doesn't have time or energy to play the old-fashioned car buying game -- the internet has made it possible to enjoy the experience. justin"
1-star,0,"went back to this dealership after having a bad experience in 2006 and not getting a deal i wanted and had a very bad experience today with the sales manager who was rude. my wife and i went there to check out the tl and really liked it and were interested in trading in a 2006 infinity, the sales rep was nice and helpful but the sales manager seemed to be anti business when i told them after about 25 minutes that i needed to get going soon, he told me it takes at least an hour to give me a price, we were the only customers in the dealership and told me to come back when i could spend an hour waiting for a price on a tl. not quite sure what is so complicated or why the sales manager was rude when i was not, maybe they were too busy, oh that's right we were the only ones shopping there. get a new sales manager and maybe we would come back."
5-star,1,these guys at this shop did a great job. i called at 1030 in the morning asking if they had the correct part and if i could come in 30 minutes before they closed (430) & he made me an appointment i arrived and they changed my catalytic converter in like 30 minutes.. it was very quick and easy it was also at a very good price i needed to get this fixed and don't have a lot of money so i'm grateful thanks guys and great job!!
5-star,1,"after a lot of research on different exhaust shops in town, i chose advance mufflers. the great reviews i read were spot on. no wait at all. brought my truck in immediately and started working. the two guys definitely knew what they were doing. cut the factory muffler off and welded the new one on along with bending some additional exhaust pipe. truck sounds great! would definitely recommend this place for any exhaust work needed."
5-star,1,advanced mufflers did a bang up job on a custom exhaust that they fabricated for my 1998 jeep wrangler. new pipe with a double walled tip and magnaflow muffler. the car hasn't sounded this good in years!
5-star,1,"i just went by to have them check out an exhaust leak. they immediately took a look and identified the problem. no upselling on sales tactics, just helped me out."
5-star,1,these guys were awesome. we needed to trace the catalytic converter on my son's truck and called and got a price in the morning. we brought it in and within 15 minutes we were on our way. very polite and professional. great work. the best price we found in town. we definitely recommend them for all your exhaust needs. we will come back for sure for exhaust work from now on. they are the best in town.
5-star,1,these guys are fast and do great clean work . i would highly recomend them to anyone . they installed a new muffler and made some custom bends as well as changed out my exhaust tips in less then 45 minutes .
5-star,1,"4runner. had flowmaster super 50 installed and the resonator removed (bad decision). drone like crazy. i checked on 4runner forum. 99% of the member states no drone if you remove the resonator. that is a load of b.s. you have to be tone deaf...if you dont hear the drone at 1800-2500 rpm. below that rpm band, no drone. above that rpm band. no drone. came back today. had a flowmaster 2.5"" branch resonator and small dynomax minibullet (using as a tip) resonator installed. welded. love it!!!!!!!!!!! no drone. yes.i went overboard with two resonator....but no drone (maybe a hint)....at all rpm band. step on gas. nice flowmaster note. now i can cruise without ear plugs. these guy did a great job."
5-star,1,"very fast and good service. some of the best prices i've found and amazing quality. they'll look at it for no charge, and will usually have the car done within 15-20 minutes."
5-star,1,"great service provided! i called to see if they had the muffler i wanted (and did), then came in about 30 minutes later, was seen right away, and they did a great job for a reasonable price. highly recommended!"
5-star,1,"called these guys up at 230pm when another shop which i won't name said they couldn't put on my xpipe cause they said its one they've never seen before and said by the looks of it that it might not fit. well the xpipe by j&m i bought was made for a 15-16 mustang gt so not sure what the heck that was about. so back to these guys... called them at 230pm and they said sure come in we'll do it. well brought in my gt 25mins later and they installed it. they did run into a little fitment issue on the right ""passenger side"" pipe seemed a little tight. well these guys stretched out the ends and also suggested i have the connections welded instead of using the band clamps that came with the xpipe. so they welded it and it looked great they even straightened out my roush axle back mufflers i already had on. looks perfect now. i couldn't of been more happy with the install. these guys were great... very knowledgeable and good at what they do.... exhaust piping!!! thanks guys!!!!"
4-star,1,"quick service for the right price. they could use a little bit of customer service etiquette training but in terms of the service quality for exhaust work, they know what they are doing. i had my catalytic converters changed at this place for 400 bux in 1 hour."
5-star,1,"hey, i was looking for a good place to get a delta 50 series flowmaster for my 98 gmc. i found a place on rancho, just down the street. after i did a quick search again, advance mufflers came out, and i started to read the reviews. all of them were positive! the other place i looked at had 1 review. so i called and talked to tino. he was professional about the flowmaster products and that the muffler would be welded on, and not clamped on. no possibility of any exhaust leaks. i watched them swap out a catalytic converter just before my truck went in. it took them 10 minutes to cut the old cat out and install a new one for this customer. mine was next and the guys didn't waste any time at all! it took them about 20 minutes to remove the old behemoth exhaust i had, and install the sweet delta 50 flowmaster, at tinos' recommendation, i might add. he was dead on! the exhaust has the low rumble i was looking for, nothing attention getting, but enough to know i'm there. granted there is only 1 lift there, but the wait was minimal. there is an opening in the shop where you see exactly what they're doing. pretty cool and reassuring to see the welding they do. highly recommend these guys for a quick, reasonably priced, professional muffler installation!"
5-star,1,just had a magnaflow muffler installed on my 2015 jeep renegade trailhawk. the shop did a great job with the install which took about 45 minutes from start to finish. reasonable price and very friendly service. all connections were welded and even watched chris take a small mirror to make sure the backsides were covered completely as well. i was very impressed with the quality of their work.
5-star,1,"out of all the muffler shops i went to, advance mufflers gave me the best price. i wanted to free up my exhaust flow a bit more since the factory setup on my car was pretty restrictive. i told them what i wanted and they did exactly what i had in mind. i definitely recommend them for either custom work and/or repairs. i'll be giving them another visit sometime in the near future to open up my exhaust system even more. thanks guys!"
5-star,1,customer service was excellent!! completed my catalytic converter work in less than 2 hours & at a fair reasonable price with a warranty! now to drive & make sure the light doesn't come on & it passes smog!!
5-star,1,this place is fast and very economical. i was quoted $1600 for a catalytic converter by another mechanic and they did it with after market parts for $500 the same day with no appointment on my 2008 nissan altima. impressive and friendly service!!!!
5-star,1,"5 stars no doubt about it. took a trip from california to vegas to the grand canyon and cracked parts of my exhaust. they fixed it and did a muffler delete with new tips that i asked for. they worked quick to get us back on the road. these guys are skilled at what they do, and recommend them withoutba doubt. dont hesitate on coming here."
5-star,1,"called and didn't have to make an appointment for my muffler swap. got there with one person ahead of me who was also getting a muffler swap. i was in and out in about an hour or so. nice little shop, they only have one lift so if you go there and there is a long line of people, it may take awhile. overall very pleased with the work and the price."
5-star,1,these guys are absolutely awesome. i told them what i wanted they gave me a good price and completed the job in about 30 minutes. they are great!!!!!
5-star,1,very friendly staff and easy going shop. i had test pipes on my car that replaced my catalyst converter which has a small crack that kept spitting out the dreaded p2a03 code. they welded it up for me and that fixed the problem right away. price was very reasonable. thanks advance muffler!
5-star,1,"excellent work and suggestion on our 15 mustang 5.0 . professional work, great product and inventory. price was good and work was done quickly and nicely."
5-star,1,excellent service. literally pulled in without appt was out the door with my flow master super 10 exhaust installed and sounding sweet in less than thirty mins for only $220. definitely recommend!
5-star,1,"chris and manny installed the best exhaust system my 1981 jeep cj 7 has ever had on it. i looked for a factory header pipe for over two year only to be told that no one manufactures them for a 1981 cj 7. chris and manny made one that clears the motor mount and the clutch linkage. the rest of the systems fit is outstanding, it is fully tucked in under the jeep allowing plenty of ground clearance. yet i still have access to all of the dive line components. the price was extremely far and my jeep was in and out in under 2 hours. thanks guys. this will be my shop for any and all exhaust system needs."
5-star,1,"been taking my cars here whenever i need exhaust or simple welding work done. fast, to-the-point service and they almost always take me in right away, unlike other busy exhausts shops in town that give an attitude and tell you to ""come back another time"". pricing is fair and the weld work is high quality and it is easy to tell the technicians here are well-experienced in their craft."
1-star,0,"buying an exhaust system is really hard, mostly because you don't know how its going to sound. so you rely on the people that work there to provide the best possible solution for what you want. i explained exactly what i didn't want my car to sound like and the goal of what i was looking for. however, the result, is exactly what i explained to them i didn't want. now, the actual work seems to be good (welds, etc), but the outcome is terrible for spending $600+ on a custom exhaust system. when i called back to express my disinterest in the work performed, they basically said there was not much they could do. i'm assuming that means that i'll basically have to pay again to rework my exhaust. now i have a car that i love, but hate to drive. it seriously makes me cringe every time step on the gas. also, after i turn my car off now and leave it in the garage, i have a really bad carbon monoxide smell in my garage and have to leave my garage door cracked until the smell goes away. i may try to buy some resonators or something and see if that can help, but i won't be bringing them here to get put on. the only positives i can say is that they did the work pretty quickly as i went and didn't have to wait very long. the guys were also very nice, but just didn't seem to know what i wanted or how to do it."
5-star,1,"was in need of a new exhaust for my 96 tacoma and found this place thru yelp. i found the previous reviews to be accurate. friendly place, flexible with what you want and they do good work. shop is small but clean, and they get you in and out quickly. i had a new magnaflow muffler installed which took only 20 minutes! would definitely recommend this shop for any muffler work."
5-star,1,"i have a 2013 jeep jk 2 door. i checked yelp and found this shop with great ratings and it was close to my home. my jeep had nothing wrong with it other than the exhaust was to quiet for me. the staff worked with me on what sound i was looking for and what i would be doing with my jeep. so i ended up ordering a flowmaster cat back with the hp-2. the staff got the jeep in without an appointment and did the install with welds on all joints no clamps. great service, great price= a great sounding jeep and a very happy customer."
5-star,1,"this is the place to go if you need mufflers and/or tips. i went earlier today, got a flowmaster 40 on my 2011 ford fusion i4. to my knowledge, not many i4's have custom mufflers on them and i looked it up on youtube trying to find one but no luck so i had to roll the dice on this one. and i hit jackpot. 1. it sounds amazing, from the start, to idle, to going at higher speeds and back down. 2. the customer service was there. i was attended by chris and someone else and they helped out so much. they were patient, helped me pick out a good sounding muffler, and they welded and worked on my car like they had all the time in the world, with quality, and it only took about 25-30 minutes! 3. the price was very reasonable. i paid $200 for everything; parts, labor, and taxes. 149 for the muffler and labor and 40 for the tip, and the rest was taxes. i would definitely recommend this place to anyone in need of a muffler. and thanks to yelp for helping me find this place and the reviews being positive because i almost went to another one where the only positive review was from the same guy that worked there."
5-star,1,"i had bought a early 90s 4runner on the cheap, knowing it needed some work. among other things, it had one hell of an exhaust leak from the rusted out cat. advance was able to weld in a replacement that fit my budget and did the work while i waited. they're my go-to for all things exhaust related now."
4-star,1,"finding a good exhaust shop in las vegas that will do good custom work is a difficult proposition. there are a lot of ""hack"" and ""tack"" shops out there that really do not take much pride in their work and i've been down that road a few times. ever since srs customs (dave lays down one of the most beautiful weld beads i have ever seen and i had him fabricate a custom mandrel bent exhaust on another car) near downtown closed down due to the economy, i have been in search of another shop. the issue i had was an exhaust leak on one of the aftermarket downpipes on my amg 63. since this is an amg, i am very particular on the workmanship. i was referred to another shop from a car forum (cannot yelp it because they must be under a different name and using a dba) perform the work that had sub par welds (used a 110v mig welder that could barely penetrate the stainless steel) and still leaked at the manifold. i took it back to that shop twice and they still couldn't resolve the issue and wanted me to leave the car overnight. hell no! from another referral, i was led to advance mufflers over on rancho between cheyenne and craig. i met tony, one of the technicians before the shop opened and we just talked cars. i found out that he was formerly a fabricator at a muscle car header manufacturer (forgot which company) in socal. we talked about header prototyping, welds, and my current situation. after our brief conversation, i felt comfortable with his knowledge and experience. especially, since my issue wasn't a complex one. within 3 hours, he had my downpipe removed, the flange repaired (the other shop damaged it in their attempt to rectify the situation), reposition the upper o2 sensor bung for the wideband sensor, bolted up, aligned the pipe and welded it back together. since i liked his welds so much, i also had him redo the other downpipe. i will be coming back for them to install my x-pipe once it arrives. would have been a 5-star, but dave from srs still laid a nicer weld bead. note: if any of you yelpers out there that have a recommendation for an exhaust shop that does above-average work and is not afraid of custom work, please message me."
1-star,0,sales rep missleaded me to believe what he said but told me the truth after i had found the price was not correct. sales rep and finance manager has no communication or maybe he doesn't want to because the finance manager was going to sell you another package by confusing you and changed everything i just came to agreement with the sales rep. the sales rep and the finance manager were going to work together to push you to get another plan. so what's the point of talking with a sales person? they pushed me to sign and paid while did not offer me a drive test on the car i was going to buy. their system sucks too!
1-star,0,"worst nightmare horrible sales manager and extremely unprofessional sales and financial staff preying on chinese people by misleading & deceiving. do not believe what they say. my friend wanted to try her chance on getting a finance, the sales (jessica) gave her a lot of wrong information on the car and made her sign a bunch of documents and told her she could get free refund for her deposit(1000), she mislead my friend to think signing the documents were only for trying out financing possibilities, and made my friend believe that she could make the final buying decision after the results come out. and of course it gets approved however my friend didn't want it since she lost her trust on this dealer by their unprofessional service and inconsistent information on the car itself. when she tried to get her deposit back as jessica promised, she was told she had to talk to the sales manager (jeff). the sales manager jeff started the conversation stating he didn't know anything about this case and said the car is now owned by the bank but refused to show us any proof in an extremely rude attitude. when we ask jeff is there any way the dealer can know the progress of the process he wouldn't answer. throughout our conversation jeff kept dodging our basic questions and insisting/encouraging us to go to court if we have any dispute. when we asked jeff is this how you do business? by cheating and tricking customers to sign the files and going to court after you get the signatures? he seems very proud and said who isn't cheating in this world?... this is how they do their business. be prepared to go to court before you walk into this place."
5-star,1,"amazing service from kurt who was extremely knowledgeable of the products, had a great test route to demonstrate the vehicle and started the negotiation process with a very competitive price. this was a no contest purchase as a result."
1-star,0,"this will my last visit at this dealership. the new advisor (who shall remain anonymous) is very unpleasant, rude, unprofessional and was creating a scene when i didn't want him to upsell me anything. he was upset and blew up. talk about being overly dramatic! it also took nearly 2 hours + 3 coffees to get my tires swapped today."
1-star,0,"i recently moved to scarborough from woodbridge. rather than driving 40km to get an oil change and tire rotation for my cx-5 at prima mazda, i booked an online appointment with agincourt mazda. despite already providing all my information online, the service guy requested that i fill in all my information again. when i was online i saw that there was no price listed for a windshield wiper change. i get a free windshield wiper change with coupon a couple of times a year at prima so i thought that came with the package. he said it would cost $30 plus labour and taxwa. i told him that the website should have said that - afterall everything else is priced. i told him no on the wiper change, i can get front and rear wipers for under $30 and install them myself. i asked them to match the free wiper deal but he told me that ""no way would any dealership in canada would give you a free windshield wiper"". i told him i get it all the time at prima. i pulled up the coupon and he disputed saying that they only gave free labour, not free wipers. and that offer was only for one specific dealership despite it coming directly from mazda canada. i showed him directly on the website that they did give free wipers, albeit only front wipers. he tried to dispute that prima charged more for their service when it was the exact same price. he tried to upsell me on brake pads. i'm about due to change them but i told him i would only change them the next time. i'll go back to prima the next time i'm in the area or try out scarborough mazda or markham mazda instead. prima might have tried the same upsell shenanigans and overcharge me like every other dealership, but at least they refer to me by my proper name and title, provide free wifi and starbucks in the waiting room, and wash the exterior of my car for free. and they follow up with me to make sure my service is satisfactory. agincourt did not even greet me by my name, and they would have probably mispronounced it anyway. and no, this is not about getting free wipers. i can easily pay $10 more to save me a trip to the store and time installing it. it is the blatant denial of service, accusing me of lying despite providing them proof, and not doing any proper industry research of their competitors that won't make me come back or allow them to make more money from me by changing my brake pads."
5-star,1,"reviews are reviews right? i came here for an oil change and nothing else... i got a report that was very unique and had some things on there that i didn't know anything about but i needed, and on the back it had a description of the significance of getting it done. i went to a mechanic that my own dad recommended me and a few days later my car wouldn't stop vibrating and making a noise. i brought it back to mazda and when they showed me the brakes apparently the mechanic i had gone to didn't do the job properly and mazda technician randy showed me what they did wrong. i couldn't believe it for my own eyes. i could have been in a serious accident. i have always had this stigma against dealerships but after this i know this is for real. i dealt with nathan (advisor) and he spoke to me like i was his family, ashley was amazing and so cheerful and comforting. love this place. guys honestly if you have any concerns just give them a call and they will help you. amazing team."
2-star,0,"honestly if your car isn't under warranty avoid this place at all costs! the service advisors always trying to sell you stuff your car doesn't need. and their ""inspection"" is a joke. not to mention mazdas high ass prices on parts and labour, like what is this a lambo dealership. after this last service i seriously doubt if i'm ever going to return to this dealership for my oil changes. after multiple oil changes they only now told me the oil i've been providing has been 0.7l short, fuck this place for real"

1-star,0,"avoid this local storage and uhaul rental business. renting anything there is a nightmare. one employee 'patrick' writes down all your credit card info including the security code on the back, then drivers license, then continues to ask for personal info. he then asked for email info, additional credit cards, etc. when confronted as to why he wanted what amounts to ""identity theft"" info, he then refused to rent and asked us to leave. when asked for the paper he had written down all our personal information on, he refused and said he would keep it. avoid. if this is the way they treat senior citizens from sun city anthem, it is alarming."
5-star,1,just brought my 4th vehicle to amazon for window tint and had yet another great experience. i appreciate there new location which is sooooo much better then the last place.
5-star,1,i noticed the advertisement on this guy's truck and ask him for a card when i was picking up my kid from school. i wanted to tint my dad's truck windows so i took him there and they took care of everything. the shop was clean and the service was very professional i could have asked for more. in fact they had more then i even asked for and will more than likely be back to have the rest of my vehicle serviced. if you're looking to get your windows tinted i would definitely go here.
5-star,1,"perfect experience! came by a few times for information and everyone was very helpful. they have a range of products to choose from. i did the front 2 side windows on my care and they were done professionally, quickly, and look great. the tint makes a huge difference in the arizona sun. i will be going back to do the back windows in the future."
5-star,1,"had window tint put on the car. fast, friendly, efficient service. from start to finish took about an hour and half. car was just as clean as when i dropped it off."
5-star,1,"i had a very pleasant experience working with brad and his crew! they tinted two of my cars and their work is phenomenal and professional! they back their work with a lifetime warranty so that really relieves me. keep in mind, it's the tint that the warranty covers, not other company windows or human error. everything was efficient, the wait time was super reasonable and spot on. their prices very reasonable and i paid what they quoted me at the beginning. they explained to me everything about their products and services as well as the process of tinting, all my questions were answered! all the details in between were covered, even the installer asked me how i wanted the tint which is a plus! the installer and brad gave me some helpful tips and advice when deciding how the car should be tinted. i'm a cautious guy so i consider every review and pictures before taking a chance with a new establishment. i'm actually surprised with the lack of reviews they have considering the amount of customers they get. looking at their work via pictures on google/yelp/fb, they work with people and bigger companies for their window, tinting, and wrapping needs! trust the positive reviews, take the negative reviews with a grain of salt. this company and its crew are legit. i was also referred here by a car dealership that i've been doing business with. i will definitely recommend this place to other people and will be back for more business! thanks guys!"
1-star,0,you were not even there! the woman working behind the counter told me that! yes..i was told that and if she told me wrong then as a business you should follow through with what your staff is telling the customer. your business is garbage.
5-star,1,good selection of tint and explained each. didn't try to up sell once i made my selection. they were ready when my appointment was scheduled and finished promptly and did a great job.
2-star,0,"shocked and disappointed! shocked in the fact that they left my newly detailed car streaked and spotted - i don't think there was one spot left clean (without streaks and/or spots from the palmolive dish detergent) on the outside of my car except for maybe the front bumper. even in the inside there were scraps of window tint left on the floor. disappointed in the fact that the installer did not treat this vehicle as if it was own, and, my complaints were ignored after in person and subsequent call to speak to mgmt. and all this after paying for the upgraded tint $300.00! sure the lady upfront said ""i'll have them clean it..."" before i left, but that would be like sending your food back at closing. thanks...but no thanks."
5-star,1,good company and quality service. i would definitely recommend to family and friends. the owner chris is great to work with. thanks!
5-star,1,"we had seen these guys at the home show in january where we received a coupon. we held onto their card and decided to have them put window tint on my car and on some windows in our new home late march. we are not disappointed at all! our coupon/discount was honored. rachel was great to work with over the phone and for payment. my car looks beautiful and the protection on the windows is superb! i highly recommend this team for your tint needs, vehicle or home!"

5-star,1,"very happy with the protective window tinting this company installed in our home last month. the installers were experienced, efficient and knowledgeable about new materials that offer more sun protection and energy savings. couldn't be more pleased."
5-star,1,had our 4th car tinted by amazon. excellent quality and customer service. our truck tint is still in great shape after more than 3 years.
5-star,1,"had them put a clear bra on a dodge ram after calling around and finding they had the best price and a 7 yr warranty vs the 5 year that everyone else offered. while installing, they found some small orange paint spray on my hood that they could not clean off before installation and called and told me so. they were willing to take it over to the car wash and have them clay bar it off so i could get the best result possible. while i wish the clear film wrapped under the hood for complete coverage, i can't complain with the price, a 7 yr warranty, or the extra time they took to get my car clayed and have the job done right. would strongly recommend!"
5-star,1,"they did a really nice job tinting my car, and it's a difficult car to tint. the price was good and the people i talked to were really nice. i did have one issue with the tint not settling in the rear window, but since it has a warranty they replaced it for free with no hassle about it. overall a good experience and i would highly recommend them."
1-star,0,ok so as far as window tinting goes they do a good job. you really need to keep an eye on the rest of your car though. they had a huge guy tinting my 2003 honda and he broke the clips that hold my back seat cushion down. when i brought it to there attention they completely refused to take any responsibility for it. i have referred 3 people here but after this experience never again. $5 in parts and a were sorry and this could have been resolved. instead they have lost my and any future referral business.
5-star,1,"i had them install window tinting in my home almost three years ago, and the install was very professionally done, looks great and saves on the electric bills. i had a warranty issue and they took care of it without a problem. these guys know their business, very knowledgeable and professional. if you need tinting give them a call, make sure to ask them about energy tax credits. i definitely recommend this business."
5-star,1,"went to aurora toyota about getting a rav4. we worked with david derouin. he was professional, well mannered, collaborative and was patient as me and my wife had different capability needs. we arranged a test drive on the day after a two day ice storm so it was a great way to see how the rav4 held up. david was patient and gave us enough time to see how the rav4 handled in different conditions. we kept going back and forth between two vehicles before finally deciding on one. negotiation was painless and not pushy. his tone and body language was positive and not aggressive or confrontational. when he went off to his manager, he was back quickly. other stuff were helpful were helpful and pleasant to deal with during the process. i also am very impressed with david and the whole team getting the car ready for us in under 24 hours. my wife had to work the next day and was facing 2 hour commute via bus. thanks very much for having it ready for us so early - much appreciated! i can't say anything bad about the process. if you are looking for a toyota, i recommend seeking david out at aurora toyota."
1-star,0,"worst dealership we've ever had the misfortune of dealing with. one of my family members sadly insists on buying toyotas despite the fact that they've become horribly unreliable, and horrendously overpriced considering the awful interiors and terrible driving dynamics compared to any other economy brand like chevy, ford, kia, hyundai, or honda. the main problem is they don't answer their phones. oh, you can call and speak to a receptionist--unfortunately the receptionist hasn't been trained to do anything except transfer your call to a the service department, which has a strict policy of never answering the phone, ever. we have to drive there to book service appointments as they don't do anything over the phone at aurora toyota. we've spoken to managers who expressed confusion, claiming they do answer the phone, but yet time and time again we call, spend half an hour on hold, call back, tell the receptionist it's unacceptable and we need to speak to someone on the same day we call, ""one moment please""=another 30 minute wait before the line goes dead...etc. finally i managed to talk my family out of buying toyotas after decades. we'll be buying a chevy bolt ev next--unfortunate that toyota no longer cares about the environment and doesn't sell a single electric vehicle, after having pioneered the prius, and now gm is decades ahead of toyota. climate change is real, fyi."
1-star,0,"the service department at this location used to be good, but has steadily declined over the past few years, to the point where i will never return. even with an appointment, i waited over 2 hours before my car was taken in, even though they knew i was waiting - unacceptable."
1-star,0,"the two locations are confusing...my first review that's on the other aurora location is actually for this location. bunch of issues at the beginning which they tried to solve, but kept having to come back and wait for hours. the sales people are great but definitely something wrong with the service centre. anyways they short changed me on what they promised as compensation and had to pay out of pocket what should have been covered. the service centre manager is also conveniently away on vacation. lots of dealer options out there...avoid this one."
1-star,0,terrible service centre; they were too busy to take my call or call me back for over 5 weeks. took them 2 weeks to confirm that there were recalls on the vin despite the fact that i could pull that information up for free on the toyota site. i was quoted $330 for parts and labor and walked out with a $2100 bill. some communication problems but billed for labour for both a wheel bearing and the same tire's breaks when we all know that the breaks are a joke to replace when you've disassembled the mounting. tires and battery i had done elsewhere for $130 less (battery) and $120 for the exact same tires.
1-star,0,"avoid! the first time i was at this car wash i did a deluxe wash where i was supposed to receive some kind of vacuum and cleaning after. when i came out of the wash i waited at the end for someone to come over or talk to me and instead i had to watch two different employees on their cell phones texting and not even acknowledging my presence while o waited in my car, i got out and waited and stop nothing. after about 10 mins of being completely ignored i just drove off total waste of money. the second time today that i went i had another terrible experience i did a simple car wash as i went to purchase my wash the young blonde cashier just stood there texting and again totally ignoring my presence when im parked right outside of her window after finally getting her attention when i asked to purchase a wash i got some snarky attitude as if i was inconveniencing her. as she was handing me my card back she decided to go back to texting while still waiting on me and mumbled something i didn't hear because she wasn't even looking at me or directly speaking to me so then i go to pull out to the wash only to be yelled at to stop my car with some screaming attitude. i barely pulled up and wasn't even in neutral yet but she freaked out on me bc. maybe i would know what to do if the employees that worked at this business would actually speak directly to their customers acknowledge their presence and do their job and respect that they are payed to do a job. i miss the self-service wash that used to be here it was a lot better used and at least i can count on myself to wash my car properly instead of paying someone else a service that doesn't even do it correctly and treat their customers like crap. i will never be going back. as a manager i dont understand how you can have customer service employees who are allowed to use their phones while working and don't have personable or polite attitudes."
1-star,0,"the worst car wash i have ever been to. the one in monroeville is great. this one, you may as well throw your money out the window. never again."
2-star,0,"this is probably the worse car wash i have ever been too. have used them about 18 times in three years. not once did they complete the work as stated. missed windows, tire dressing, streaks on windows, water spots on car surface and missed tire rims. also their pricing is high for the poor work they deliver."
2-star,0,"this place was a bit of a disappointment. the exterior looked great, but the interior was a waste of money. the staff was kind, but lazy. i could have done a better job at home. i would give them another shot, but cautiously."
1-star,0,"the first couple of times i went to this place, they did a reasonable (although not spectacular) job, and were very friendly and helpful, so i thought the bad reviews were just sour grapes or cranky people. nope, they are right on. not long ago, i went in again and paid for their top of the line regular wash, as usual, which was to include an interior cleaning. i had just barely sat down in the waiting area before they told me the car was done. they hadn't even touched the interior! hadn't vacuumed, hadn't even wiped down the dash or cleaned the windows. and they left the trash right where it was. then they flat out refused to do any of it, including toss the trash - saying that throwing out the trash wasn't their job! hello? seriously? i have *never* come across a car wash that has copped an attitude like this. and they refused to do any of the rest of the interior because of the things i had on the floor and some of the seats. would. not. even. touch. it. when i complained, they nastily told me to get out of there and not to come back. they did at least refund my money, but i would have far rather just have had my car cleaned. why do people work at a carwash if they're not willing to, you know, actually clean cars?"
1-star,0,"scammers! don't waist you $$$ i purchased a gift card for a detailed auto wash. i have called the number on the card several times to schedule the car wash as you have to schedule a detailed and left numerous messages and no one ever calls me back. i finally drove out to the place to ask for a refund and was told the manager would have to issue one for me. of course he was not around, so i left my name and number for him to call me back and he never has."
1-star,0,"they used to do a good job and maintain their self wash/self vacuum stations. the stations went downhill last year and now the actual car wash with hand detail option is bad too. i visited earlier this summer to be greeted by a pushy, younger guy that drove a bentley (pointed out it was his). he claimed he was the owner. i purchased a detail and had to schedule it approx. 8 weeks in advance. i had the detail done today. a new guy claimed he was the owner and that the old guy was not. i had a bad feeling from the start and my gut was correct. i never received a call my car was done, so went there near closing time and found bird droppings still on the roof. the worst part is the fact there are acidic stains on the paint. the car is worse off now, then it was when i dropped it off this morning. avoid this place!"
5-star,1,"this place is great! you will not get a better deal or service anywhere else. my car looks amazing! i wanted a full detail after i left my windows down during a storm creating a funky odor. when i arrived the details were booked 2 weeks out, i told them what happened, and bought the speed detail. they shampooed my carpets for free, even though they were busy and it was not included! also, i had a dent in my back bumper, dom offered to fix it for a very reasonable price and through in the full detail i originally came here for. i went for a full detail, and left with : 1. a fixed bumper 2. speed detail 3. full detail this place spoiled me, my car, and my wallet!"
1-star,0,"this place is an absolute ripoff. i payed for the ""premium plus,"" which is the highest level of service short of a full-out detail. in this case, the ""premium plus"" amounted to an automated car wash and two guys hastily wiping water off of my car's exterior and then making a half assed, one minute attempt at vacuuming. the owner apparently has no desire to establish a loyal customer base, so i'm thinking maybe this so-called ""car wash"" is a front... i guess we'll know for sure when we see ""crystal blue"" make an appearance in pittsburgh."
5-star,1,"i've been going to their drive thru wash for several months now, but i decided to get the full detail recently and i was extremely pleased with the results! the car looks and smells great and they even removed all my cords and wires hooked up to my stereo so they wouldn't get damaged by the machines. then they drove the car back down to me at work (only a few blocks away) so that i wouldn't have to walk back to get my car. i will definitely keep going for the regular wash and next time i need another detail i will absolutely go to them first."
5-star,1,"i don't usually get my car detailed, however i had north dakota dirt and grime sandblasted by wind into my paint. no joke. the fellows working on my car did a fabulous job, especially brandon. he even got the yellow paint off from when i ran into a pole:) my vehicle was sparkling and they paid special attention to whatever i asked. worth the money:)"
1-star,0,"i visted unique auto wash today....a gray rainy pittsburgh day. i was the only customer. i paid $25 for the everything wash and towel dry. @ attendants were working. this was hands down the worst car service i have ever received. footprints (from my kids) remained on my passenger dash, my center console was filthy (i was told center console is not included in the ""interior package""), as were all four of my doors. the door jams were not touched, and crumbs remained throughout the interior. i could have vacuumed better with a rake. i called to complain and am awaiting a return call rom the manager. i went straight to washington blvd carwash and completed the interior myself. if i could give a half star rating, i would. shame on you unique carwash....total rip off!!!"
5-star,1,"only carwash in the east end that's not in the ghetto. getgo got rid of theirs for more pumps last year. the express wash for $5 from 4-7pm is a good deal, as is the vip wash for $7 (coupons on website), which includes wheels, clear coat, towel dry, triple foam and underbody flush. get the rain x for $1 more. $2 tip makes it $10 total. the vip plus with interior for $20 is naturally a rip off, but anyone with basic math skills can assess that vacuuming and wiping the windows for 12 additional clams is dumb. so vacuum yourself for $1 and buy some pre-packed windex wipes for $2 at target and be on your merry way."
3-star,0,"i'm reviewing the ""do it yourself"" section, not the ""drive thru with teenagers"" section. sigh. why are all the vacuums i find $1?! that is so expensive. so i pull up to the first one, take everything out of the car, get big time hit on by the brotha vacuuming next to me (to the point that he would not leave me alone), and realize that the vacuum is out of order. i back up and go to another one, after running over my bag of groceries... already i was in a sour mood. the vacuums worked ok i guess, for $1! i used about $4, and they did have a convenient, working change machine, so that was nice. but, the entire time i was there i was being harassed by this guy next to me. like, begging me for my phone number, etc while he was blaring his music. then people drove by and honked at me vacuuming. how annoying. so, for you ladies, i think it's just a bad location. go to oakland or somewhere where women are more common (?) if you're in a rut, i guess this place can work. it's a bit weathered, but it does the trick."
1-star,0,"i pull up to the unique autowash and pay $21 dollars to get the car washed, towel dried ($2), and vacuumed ($6). the car runs through the autowash--it's nothing to write home about--and at the end, there are three teenagers drying and vacuuming. lackluster would be an overstatement. one kid never took his eyes off his phone and texted the entire time. the other two did a mediocre job vacuuming and barely dried the car. there were streaks all over. pathetic. i would have given the place two stars, but at that price point, it's verging on a rip-off. let me note that in both chicago and san diego, i got the same exact service for about $10 and they actually did a good job. my car is still dirty. any recommendations out there?"
5-star,1,was visiting my family for the holidays and transmission started slipping. he took me in right away and drove it immediately to figure out the problem. they were honest and thoughtful and did not do any unnecessary work. he spent a good hour with me and walked me through all the pros and cons of each option for the fix. would recommend them to anyone!
5-star,1,"i've been a customer of theirs for almost 20 years. they do good work, they only do the work that needs to be done and they are honest people that will go the extra mile for you."
5-star,1,"i have been with the asm for 15 years and find the staff to be professional, responsive and courteous. they have taken care of all our vehicles over the years and owners and techs have always been fair and honest in our dealings. ken and tom are exceptional to work with. i always feel confident that i receive the best service possible when i need inspections or repairs. i would highly recommend asm for anyone seeking quality automobile service."
5-star,1,"i have been going to auto service mall for over 20 years and have found them to be fair, honest, and reasonably priced. the owners and techs are very friendly and and you are treated respectly. if your car needs minor work that is what repaired. nothing else is done. when tom or ken says my car needs something done i know i can always trust them. i go no where else with my cars."
1-star,0,no good!! don't ever go or trust these individuals with your vehicle. the garage personnel are rude and unprofessional the parking lot is small and there is no where to park.
1-star,0,"i listened to an autozone employee and now i have an expensive repair. i walked in to the store asking for a ac refrigerant for my prius. the guy behind the register andy moore said any of the ones they have will work. i said that i read that prius needs a special one. he said he never heard it. he asked me what my car year was, plugged it in the computer, and said, that the computer says 134a, and that again, any of them will work. he didn't offer to help pick one even though there were at least 2 employees in the store and no other customers. i picked two, and asked if either would work. he said yes, so i got the cheaper one (avalanche 18oz). i went to refill my refrigerant, and half way through the process i noticed a print at the bottom saying that it is not to be used with hybrid!!!!! i went back to the store and told me he sold me a wrong one. andy didn't care, he said the computer told him what he told me and didn't offer to even give me money back for the refrigerant. now i have to take it to a mechanic to get it replaced and who knows how much it will cost me to fix it. avoid this store, or at least the employee by the name of andy moore who by the way may be the manager.."
5-star,1,"called ahead to get 2 cabin air filters, put them on hold, and picked them up when i arrived. friendly service and clean store!"
2-star,0,"the customer service was horrible. i went in to buy oil, i had no clue what i was doing. not only did they not say anything to me when i walked in but i stood there staring at all the choices while 2 empoyees walked pasted me. i ended up calling my step dad for help, because i couldn't get any at the store. not happy."
5-star,1,"i've come to this auto zone in the past with my old betsy when she was at the end of her days, and was treated with respect and kindness then. i started having problems with my new car a few days ago and tried going to a location near my new house and had a terrible experience. i made the drive to tempe today and was not disappointed! angel helped me solve every issue with the best customer service ever! seriously, i wanted to hug him. he made this stressful situation into a pleasant one! if you need car parts, even if you're not in tempe, come see these guys - it'll be well worth it!"
1-star,0,"new staff they have is unfriendly, pretentious, and all around rude. i purchased some bosch spark plugs for my toyota camry from a different autozone, in which, i later decided to return them because i would rather use the original brands, ngk or denso. as usual, the cashier asked me why i'm returning, i tell him my reason and his reply to me was, ""why!? did you know that bosch is made by toyota?"" all while giving me a look as if i didn't know what 2+2 was. i was taken back a bit because in no way does toyota, a japanese company, make bosch that is german. i didn't mention anything because i did not want to deal with a dumb and pretentious person. thankfully i got my full refund and i won't be coming back to this place."
1-star,0,"not a good experience. my service engine soon light came on and i happened to be near, so i decided to stop in and see if i could get a reading or some insight. i went in and asked, and was told to refer to my cars' manual. okay. fair enough. i go out to my car and start flipping through the manual, with the car on, and notice that the a/c isn't kicking out cool air while the car is sitting still. so i head back inside to find a solution and i'm handed a can of stp ac pro that retails around $50 (and told it costs that much bc of the reusable gauge that's attached). the instructions are fairly simple, so i head back out to my car and follow them to a ""t"". that gauge that's supposed to tell you when to stop isn't functioning and unbeknownst to me, i put in too much fluid. luckily, i stopped before any major damage occurred. i brought the can back inside with the intention of either returning it or getting some assistance with it on the second try. as i approach the counter, a line forms behind me. the cashier, assuming i'm doing one of these two things, asks me to move to the side so he can help everyone purchasing something first. i wait, even though there are two other employees behind the counter, and then notice one customer is purchasing the same thing, different brand, gauge and all, for less than half the price. nice that i was given the way more pricey one as if it were my only option. finally the rep who had me wait walked outside with me to take a look at what the product is doing. he notices that the gauge is not working and checks the pressure using a small tool he has on hand. informs me that i put in too much of the ac pro and my unit is at risk of blowing. there is a yellow dye that squirts out onto his finger. he tells me that the dye is the reason that the gauge was not reading correctly and mentions that there is a shop down the street that i should probably go to. i go to the the shop, aka just brakes, to get my car looked at. they let me know that the guys at autozone gave me some bad information. first, they tell me that the ac pro cans are about the worst thing a person can use; informing me that they see peoples' units destroyed all the time by them. second, the dye is normal and has nothing to do with the gauge not functioning. just brakes took good care of me. autozone wasted a good chunk of my day, pushed me aside after i had just spent a lot of money there, gave me bad information, and just had a sour attitude through most of our interaction."
5-star,1,"man i went there because i needed some quick help with my car, and angel, went out his way to help me out.... he still managed to take care of 2 other customers at the same time!!!! thanks 100% angel."
5-star,1,"these guys are amazing! christmas eve and rainfall, these guys are out here replacing my car battery just in time for the holidays. can't thank you enough jose(angel) and daniel. happy holidays!"
5-star,1,"i freaking love these guys! everyone who helped me was awesome. joe, andy, chuck, and other guys in the store whose names i didn't get but i think everyone who was working today helped me in some form or another. i'm almost completely clueless when it comes to cars but i always google my issues and am able to get an idea of what's going wrong and what i need to do - so turned out that i needed to replace my alternator, as it wasn't charging the battery anymore. i bought a new alternator from them and changed it outside, they lent me tools and kept coming out to check on my bf and i as we were doing the job. they helped us a lot with trouble shooting some issues and in the end, we left with a working car for which i am super grateful. i'm not a phoenix native so the heat really gets to me but i don't think anyone wants to be bussing it in 100+ weather so thank you autozone! definitely recommending for anyone needing help to come to this location."
5-star,1,"i have been to this store 3 times over the last month for various auto related things. i will keep going back because of charles' knowledge and willingness to explain the details. i appreciate his thoroughness and educative approach. i'm not a mechanic but do the work myself with a family relative who is, and i enjoy learning the ""why"" of things. i would rather pay a little extra and get the genuine expertise vs saving a few bucks and buying online. great job charles."
5-star,1,"angel is the best,this guy goes beyond the call of his job, although nobody is prefect this guy always goes out of his way to make sure you get the right part. great job angel, weather i spend one dollar or 2,000, i always got the best from angel"
5-star,1,"in the middle of a monsoon, trying to get home from the airport, my car won't start. we get it jumped and head here where we had the most amazing service from donald who took his time with us, provided incredible assistance and knowledge, and made sure that when we left we were not only in a safe car but also in better spirits. no one wants to deal with a dead battery but he definitely made the whole experience better. my husband and i want to personally thank donald for what he did for us tonight. i'm not sure when i'll need to come back but knowing that he's in the autozone brand, we will definitely be returning customers in the future. thanks, donald!!"
5-star,1,"wow!!!! i came in today because my rearview mirror in my car fell off. i brought the mirror in but when i was checking out i realized i forgot my purse. i ran home to grab money and when i came back they had my mirror all ready to go and scraped off all of the old glue for me! and then dillon came out to my car and scraped the old glue off the windshield for me in 104 degree weather. not only were they incredibly helpful with the old glue and directions for the new glue, but the whole staff was so friendly! if i knew things about cars i would apply to your store! thank u so much! u guys really made my day!!!"
5-star,1,i had the worst day dealing with some banking issues. i had the money in my account but wasn't able to access it. i got a hold of derick and he was absolutely wonderful! he helped me pay for the part i needed via paypal! he also installed the part for me. just wanted to give a shoutout to derick and all the employees at this auto zone! they were so helpful and informative! so thankful i went to this location!
5-star,1,"this place is awesome!!! way better then the scottsdale location. went to the autozone in scottsdale first. the guy must have been having a bad day because he was not interested in helping me at all. all i needed was a new headlight and it seemed to be too much of a struggle for him. leaving with no parts to fix my car i left that location and drove 5 miles down the road to the tempe autozone and was helped by karl. he was extremely helpful, even in the 110 degree weather, he made sure the parts i got for my car were correct. from start to finish he was on it!! made me totally glad i didn't just give up on autozone all together!!!! thanks a ton karl!"
5-star,1,i walked right in and was helped right away at about 9:30am. i just bought a car off craigslist and my headlights weren't working. jose went to my car and inspected the headlights from under the head and detected that it was just loose and a but dirty. he didn't just automatically charge me for headlights i didn't need. i appreciated it so much because i just spent all the money i had on the car. i'll be back for my future needs for my new car!
5-star,1,"i was really impressed with the service i got here. i was just coming in to get a battery and when i was changing it out in the rain, the extra care they gave really went a long way. i could tell they really enjoy their jobs. i thanked them via the auto zone website, but figured other people on yelp might appreciate the info."
5-star,1,this place is pretty great!. i ended up stranded with a busted alternator in a work truck and after calling ahead this is the only place that had one in stock. the sales associate made sure i had the right part and after installing it at my shop the core return was easy. i'm glad they had the part ready to go.
5-star,1,"i have a 1970 oldsmobile that needed a few things to get her running, so i called auto zone and spoke to a rep named angel on the phone. he was extremely professional, very helpful, and sincerely thanked me for calling autozone at the end of our conversation. today i went to the store, needing some oil, seafoam, and carb igniter. angel patiently walked me around the store, pointing out the items i needed and what would make sense based on their selection. i also brought in a dead battery that angel offered to charge --- at no cost!! (something autozone will do for anyone). when i returned an hour later, the battery had a positive ""good"" charge, and i was on my way. ((had i had to buy a battery, however, angel walked me through the three different options and why each one would make sense based on the quality of the battery and the warranty that accompanied each battery.)) i'd definitely recommend this autozone -- all the guys representing this store had positive attitudes and seemed like genuinely good people who care about the people walking through their front doors, even calling at least one customer by name! if you need anything for your car and live anywhere near 35 e. broadway, go to this autozone!!"
5-star,1,"i had a battery problem and was turned away at the auto-zone right by my house, which is on baseline and priest. the staff there told me they could not find my warranty information, but they were more than willing to sell me another battery minus $50 credit for my old one since i had a 5 year warranty and the battery was under 3 years i should have gotten a new one. they were not very helpful so i walked out. several days later took my dead battery to this store where it took jarrett kyle a few minutes to find my warranty info and i received my new battery without any problems wonderful service. i am a very happy customer it's a shame that the store that's a 1/4 mile from my house is so lousy"
1-star,0,there are very incompetent workers especially angel rodriguez. extremely rude and unable to complete the simplest of tasks. i called to look up a part and got there to pick it up but they didn't have it due to looking up the wrong part over the phone... no wonder they are hiring. their current staff is shit!
1-star,0,"i feel that the system is flawed. i bought a battery in 2010 went to have it replaced in 2012 and he said i had a different battery in my truck, it wasn't. he fought me and i had to buy a new battery. in 2014 i went to get a replacement, same thing said that it was a different from the one purchased in 2012, he fought me for a few then looked deeper and saw that i was correct. so, i lost money on the first one and almost the second. i wish their system would not fail me."
5-star,1,"went here for the first time and was truly impressed by the service. i had a replacement mirror that needed to be installed and though they said they regularly don't do that, they put it on free of charge. they also fixed my tail light and later on the same day when i found out i needed a battery change i showed up and they replaced one out for no charge. great service, great prices. i recommend karl he was very nice and helpful!"
5-star,1,"we figured out today that both brake lights were out on our car. called this location to see if they had the item on hand, which they did. donald helped me on the phone and greeted me also once i arrived to the store. he was very friendly and had already had the lights waiting for me at the register. after signing up for the rewards program they offer and paying for the lights, donald also installed the lights for us!!! excellent customer service!!!!! thank you donald again for getting us back on the road safely."
5-star,1,"i cannot say enough good things. i came in with a check engine light. eric checked it out, and it turns out my antifreeze reservoir was leaking terribly (hose was detached and unfixable). he, jose, and jose r. spent the time to explain everything to me, looked for a new part (didn't have it in stock so i bought it and brought it in), and installed it. they took a great deal of time and care in creating a temporary seal in the hose so that i could go out and buy said part. if they hadn't done this, my car would be toast. they truly saved me a lot of money and heartbreak. eric, jose r. (he goes by joe), jose, and teresa were all so incredibly kind, generous, and helpful. i hope their boss reads this because they truly deserve some sort of compensation. on top of all this, i think they understood that i knew nothing about cars, yet they didn't try to take advantage of me. that's really hard to find in the car care service. i certainly will be coming back to this location for all my car care needs."
5-star,1,"stopped by yesterday when my car battery had completely died. since it was under warranty i received my replacement batter for free. they offered to put it in for me but i went ahead and took care of it. figured since i was there to get my alternator checked out. turns out it was bad...they didn't have the part there but their manager went to another location since i couldn't drive and picked it up for me. by this time, all the mechanics were closed for the night and i'm sitting in a parking lot with a car running purely on a battery. the associate behind the counter pointed out a mobile mechanic that was in the parking lot. after talking to him, he not only was able to replace my alternator for me, but replaced the belts as well for a fraction of what it would have cost me at a mechanic's shop. the staff there was extremely helpful, above and beyond what needed to be done and also picked up some new brake light bulbs while i was there which of course they help look up for you. will definitely be back here again if i need help and strongly recommend their services. exactly the kind of customer service one would love to receive from every place you go. great place to go for check engine code scanning too. they do it for free and can then look those codes up online when you get home to determine what you need to do!"
5-star,1,thanks autozone! they helped me figure out where the fuse to my lighter was located and how to replace it. $5 and 15 minutes and i was back on the road. i am so grateful that the dvd player will now be able to run on the 14 hour ride home!
5-star,1,"i just bought my scooter a few weeks ago and had no idea what oil it needs. i went to the autozone and they were extremely helpful. took me to the area for two-stroke engines with fuel injectors. they carry both regular and synthetic oil. surprisingly, the synthetic oil (better than the rest) was only $3.99 for a quart. sweetsa!"
5-star,1,"i've been meaning to write this review for a few weeks. my battery died and i got a jump from a co-worker after work. so i drove right down to the auto zone at the southeast corner of mill ave & broadway rd in tempe. the staff there were all outstanding. when i got there, they were pretty busy, and the district manager was about to leave for the day. when he saw me standing there, he set his things down and called me over. so there i was, dressed in my suit & tie, attempting to change a battery. he sent out one of his employees (david) to help me change the battery. david had a little trouble because the battery is located under a bunch of other things in my car. however, david was very professional. so, this other employess, shelly comes out there and changes my battery like it was no big deal! she was more than happy to help, and thanked me for being a customer! wow! bravo to auto zone for their friendly, and very capable staff! i have since gone there for miscellaneous items, and will shop nowhere else for any car needs. this place is the real deal!"
3-star,0,"great place to have your battery recharged. they require that you bring your own oil back to the recycle bin... which is gross and impossibly filthy. i really can't leave this place without getting dirty. but hell, i really can't complain. i like getting dirty."
1-star,0,"they do horrible jobs on any especially if it's not foreign ."" they have some good jobs most likely on foreign cars, but their prices leave then overbooked for convenient work that is completely unsatisfactory."""
5-star,1,i honestly don't know why that previous review hated on tony! he was extremely kind and honest to me when my car got damaged by a semi he worked quickly and gave me reasonable pricing - the car ended up not being salvageable and he even helped me sell it to a mechanic. honest and genuine service 0 complaints i was very happy with my experience.
1-star,0,i wouldn't take my car here ever again bad customer service tony is not a man of his word. and he rips people of i found some who worked on my car way inexpensive and it was a cleaner shop and they offer snacks if you have to wait extra for your car. auto spec was a good place but it's gone down the drains. i'm writing just to save the viewers a headache
5-star,1,"i am happy to have found the best auto mechanic in town. i came in with a small dent in a problematic spot, and my car looks again like new after they took care of it, there is no slightest sign that anything happened. i got a great price, everybody were friendly, the owner is very informative and they are dedicated to what they do. i am confident that i will be coming here with all the future repairs after my warranty expires, as well as i recommend this place to my friends. i am glad that i don't have to look any further. i greatly cherish my vehicle and i would not let anyone to even wash it, however i surely believe that this is the place to go to. it made my day that my car was so nicely taken care of, and when my car is happy, i am happy. additionally, it is easy to find and in a popular location (sahara @ decatur), so they get a lot of traffic. also, the usa auto with a $7.77 smog check is right next door (i also went there, superb service as well), so now thats two excellent businesses in one location. i am highly satisfied."
5-star,1,i took both s-63 mercedes benz to them for 3 years now and i will not allow anyone to work on them but tony. i have taken them to three other places and other than expensive talk nothing happened. if you care for your german car or car in general you will not go wrong with this guys. they are the best in their field not to mention honest as well.
2-star,0,"so i do give good reviews and find i am lenient but maybe not so much here. they hit my soft spot. i came there to get my headlights restored. i asked about the process and tony told me they did seal it up with a sealer afterwards. so the job took a while and it looked fantastic but. he said the reason they don't use a sealer is because it is pointless with the hot sun. he told me to bring it back in, in a few months and they could polish it up again meaning dropping another 20 dollars on the job. i could do the job myself but for 20 dollars, it is worth someone else doing it because that is how much it costs in getting the supplies myself. the reason they sell a non-yellowing clear coat is for the fact that i would not have to bring it back in. i hate how these shop guys think we are not educated. i am a mechanic and play dumb sometimes just to hear what these guys say. plus, there is youtube. save yourself time on doing headlights yourself. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uejbklz7rmm"
1-star,0,do not go here i've had several mishaps with this place the biggest one of all was a catalytic converter installed backwards causing too much back pressure therefore ruining spark plugs and injectors on my car. i called tony out on it and he refused to do anything. also i had a water pump replaced and he didn't bleed the system causing my car to overheat because there was no water and too much air in the system. in addition a friend had a fuel pump replaced and tony installed it wrong causing a major fuel leak all over the road and car. also misdiagnoses cars all the time because he doesn't want to spend time on your car. so many headaches i will never come here again and i suggest you do the same. you could probably throw away your money instead of coming here and that would probably be more affective then coming here.
1-star,0,"i took my car in to replace the crank shaft regulator, tony began flirting with me and offering that if i had problems paying, we take it out in trade and asked if my boyfriend was good to me, but when i picked up the car, they demanded payment but, failed to give me a receipt. i asked for the receipt and was given a written amount of $400 but, no description of services. i drove away and within 10 minutes my tire exploded, wires hung from the wheelwell. i called them, they promptly towed my car back to their shop, where they kept it for nearly two months. when i finally got the call to pick up my car, again i was not given a receipt. again, my car had more problems than before i dropped it off, it no longer had a smooth ride and the brakes squeaked. i returned on two occasions to make complaints and they simply told me to pay more and they would fix it. my car now shakes when i drive it, i feel unsafe and now to fix it will cost more than it is worth. and even though the asian guy who supposedly owns the shop called me several times while the car was there, in order to make to force me into payments, has never called since, even though i've never paid the last amount that they ask for. on the few times that i showed up just to see what was happening what the progress was my car was on a lift beside another mercedes also on a lift tony said he was using that car for parts but my car is not fixed and i was told that it was his personal vehicle. i honestly believe he used my car to fix his car. that is why they did not hound me for payment, because his fixed car was payment enough."
1-star,0,"my friend took her vehicle to this business last year for 1 problem,but when she picked up her vehicle several more problems occurred she called them back and they picked up her vehicle and kept it for nearly 2 months and refused to give her a receipt and the car has many more problems in addition to the original one still occurring.now the repairs on this vehicle will cost more than the vehicle is worth.this establishment turned this 2002 mercedes c240 into a running garbage can.this place is terrible and we wouldn't recommend this."
1-star,0,please do not go to this place it took all my money $3k and totally didnt fix my problem and still kept asking me to pay more. here my story to tell guy named tony took my car in shop and ask me bout $3k too repair the rear damage and coolant system. after it my car been repaired same day i picked up my car the coolant level light popped out i took back to the autospec they said no problem you can still drive everywhere if i listen to him and drive i b dying now. this place is completely bullshit overpriced mindgame playing. he even ask me another $500 to fix the coolant system since he made a wrong decision to replace the water bump?not even sure he replaced it or just say so? never leave your car here to repair well if you still think here is the place to repair your car good luck my friend. take your car to another place will be a better choice.
5-star,1,"bmw, mercedes, audi, porsche, ferrari mechanic shop in las vegas this is the best one. i have been taking my cars here forever. several bmws including an 850i which now even the dealer themselves were able two repair and diagnose correctly. most recently hay work done on an a5. i live in san diego and i bring my cars all the way to vegas just for tony to work on them. pricing and quality of work are worth the trip. best european mechanic hands down!"
5-star,1,they are awesome here. you can't go wrong dealing with tony and ed. price is always been fair and informative when it comes to my s500.
5-star,1,"finally found a great foreign car repair shop in vegas. ed & tony are honest, fair & reliable. been there 3 times. every time great service. one time they picked up & dropped off my car. another time they charged me less then the original quote. always take the time to explain everything."
1-star,0,"i got sent here by my dealership that was doing repair work to my 2007 mercedes c230. i had got a detailed diagnostic for the mercedes dealership that cost me $170 that stated clearly everything wrong with the car. so, me and the dealership had a repair agreement arrangement. so let me inform you that that the only person i am communicating with is my salesperson since they are the ones paying. anyways, the person whom i was dealing with was named tony. i was notified that that the camshaft position sensors all 4, my transmission mount were replaced on my car as i picked it up. he said he could only prove me with a receipt once my dealer paid for it which made sense. later that same day, the engine light had turned on and when i ran the diagnostics it read the sensor codes! they literally probably just turned off the engine light. i do not recommend this place."
5-star,1,they are honest and also affordable. .not like other mechanics these days that try to charge for things u dont need! ask for tony..he will explain what is necessary and give you the best options!
1-star,0,"came in to test and possibly purchase a car battery. the customer service rep/some old guy with missing teeth, was the least helpful person ever when asking him the difference between two batteries... ""well this one is better."" okay... please explain why it is better. ""it just is."" ahhh... okay. i'm gonna take your word for it because it's got a shorter warranty and $100 more expensive, because it's just better. no thank you. please try to be a little bit helpful. instead of just take my word for it."
1-star,0,"do not ask these people for help! working for a auto parts store with no freakin clue of auto parts even with the help of a computer. they will sell you the wrong piece that will screw up your car so that an oil change now turns into am $800 part needing to be replaced. and when you tell them instead of trying to fix they problem that they have caused, just look at you and say they're sorry. really! ?!? so find somewhere else to shop! save yourself time, aggravating, and money!! this store has idiots working for them."
5-star,1,"i have gotten great service at this location! the staff and manager are knowledgeable, friendly, and care about their store. i went in with a major problem from two batteries from another autozone location. a guy here replaced it under warranty but significant damage was done from previous battieries and poor installation and i needed the $$$ terminal replaced from the manufacture. i came back with my receipts the manager helped me initiate a claim on her day off!"
4-star,1,"this particular autozone is pretty good. the store looks clean. the staff is friendly and professional. like most part stores if they don't have it they can get fairly quick. i've ordered a few power window motor replacement kits(three of the four power windows all stopped working, one at a time, within like 6 weeks, weird). once it was in stock, and the others i could get them normally by the afternoon, or the next day. i've returned a few items i bought for projects just in case things went bad, and save me a trip back to the parts store in the middle of the project. totally hassle free with returns. thumbs up! i gave four stars because i feel a couple of employees could use some more training as it took the entire store staff to change my wiper blades on one occasion. and i asked for high temp thread sealer and the the employee pulled and rang up thread lock."
5-star,1,the staff was very helpful. the employee removed the headlight bulb found the replacement and even install the new headlight bulb before i could even pay for it. i recommend this location. they gave some good advice on another question that i had.
5-star,1,this place rocks and the people that work here actually like helping you with any automobile issues that you may encounter. the best auto parts place around bar none.
5-star,1,"the employees are always so helpful and courteous. anytime i need a new battery, they install it quickly. thank you for being a place i can trust!"
5-star,1,my left rear taillight was out and i went to other places that wouldn't help me with it. i came to this autozone and david g. was more than willing to help me. i have a 2012 jeep and some things on my car are pretty complicated to fix including the taillight. he fixed it quickly and was super nice the whole time. i highly recommend this location and having david help you. he was so professional and knowledgeable.
1-star,0,"the day staff is awesome but go there at night time and you will get rude customer service . i purchased an item in the morning time that was not available and they advise me they will call me when its @ the store which they did oh lawd i should've gotten up then but i didn't i went in later to encounter the most rudest employee of autozone shavon all i can say she needs to be coached on customer service...(cause i got a refund)let me put this here for her cause i know she will read this. what customer service is : politeness: politeness is almost a lost art. saying 'hello,' 'good afternoon,' 'sir', and 'thank you very much' are a part of good customer service. for any business, using good manners is appropriate whether the customer makes a purchase or not. professionalism: all customers should be treated professionally, which means the use of competence or skill expected of the professional. professionalism shows the customer they're cared for. personalization: using the customer's name is very effective in producing loyalty. customers like the idea that whom they do business with knows them on a personal level."
5-star,1,"came in on sunday with the help of a lovely gentleman who just transferred to this location. he was super attentive, helpful, and did not take advantage of a girl who doesn't know a lot about cars unlike most places. greatly appreciated and extremely hard to come by. thank you!"
5-star,1,"my husband and i got stuck since our battery died and walked to this autozone and doug, the store manager, was so kind to help us out! martin and kevin (who will be at decatur and vegas dr. location) drove us back to our car and made sure we got our new battery set before they left! we are so thankful since it's already so hot out and it was a 30 minute walk one way!!! never had that amazing customer service that absolutely went above and beyond!!! thank you!!"
5-star,1,"been buying parts here for many years. the service is excellent and very friendly staff. i like dealing with sean, he is very polite and very knowledgable in helping with your car/truck problems and knows his parts. great guy and a great asset to autozone."
5-star,1,yesterday we brought my wife's car to pick up a battery. edwin g. showed me several to choose from and then amazingly he installed the battery in the car for us! never expected that kind of service and he did a tremendous job! i would recommend them to anyone looking for automotive help.
5-star,1,"these guys are the best! checked our battery, we needed a new one, they installed it out in the hot sun and did a great job! always friendly and professional."
5-star,1,very service oriented. the tall gentleman went over and beyond this service that was given. i wish there were more people like him in service oriented businesses
2-star,0,"take my advice and if you have questions don't rely on any employee here to give you the right item. i was being helped by a manager and still was directed to the wrong filter. that was after he inspected the current one under my hood!! also returning to pick up a battery within two hours, the guy working with my friend had totally forgotten who he was. he had just dealt with him and helped him out for 20 minutes. facial recognition is important to me in customer service. the main reason this location gets 2 stars, is the inconvenience of getting all the way home, to find out the filter you were told to buy is nowhere close to the right size and having to return it with no apology..."
4-star,1,"amazing! my battery was dying. not only did the guy (i believe his name was adam) check my battery for me, but he also showed me how a lot of mechanics might try to screw me over by setting the battery tester incorrectly so that it would show a bad battery even if it was a good battery. wow! thank you! secondly, i expected to have to buy a new battery. he double checked for me and determined that we bought that battery at another auto zone and it was still covered under warranty! free battery! to top it off, he installed the new battery for me and attached a temporary charger to the vehicle to make sure it didn't lose a charge, as my vehicle might have gone all wiggy if it was without power for too long. i told him, and i was being 100% honest, that if i carried cash, i would've given him a tip! he said it wasn't necessary and that our family has done enough with my husband being military. yes, we also had a friendly conversation as he installed my new battery. he was just all around friendly."
5-star,1,great company! super easy to communicate with. very professional. fixed a broken lock on a door to a rental house. flexible too as my tenant had s time constraint. i would recommend and will be calling again !
5-star,1,absolutely the best locksmith experience i've ever had. they arrived in 10 minutes. dave was very knowledgeable about different type of locks and he was efficient. the manager ben was absolutely understanding and helpful! if ever i need a locksmith these are my go to guys i highly recommend.
5-star,1,"i was having a long day and of of course, like typical people, i locked my keys in the car, looking for a service is not something easy, especially under stress, i found this locksmith, which i would highly recommend, and i am grateful for they were very quick and friendly there is a tear in my ruber lining for the car from the force i wish we could've prevented he was nice but i should have been paying closer attention"
5-star,1,"great, fast and fair service. lost key to pod that was delivered. needed to have removed without damaging ( cutting lock ) or $500 fee from pods for their door closing repair ( joke ) but bi came out. fast! and picked lock in .30 seconds, made sure door opened. so many times i got the bait and switch in chicago from locksmiths - so just moving here - this guy gets a shout out for saying $65 for service on the call, 20 minutes to get here and .30 to fix it and was off again. very cool! steve"
5-star,1,"ben was great in installing a programmable keypad for me at a new home. he was professional, on time and he accommodated my work schedule. also, a week later i had some challenges with the keypad, and ben did the necessary research, contacted the keypad manufacturer and took care of my keypad. i definitely would do business with ben again..."
5-star,1,"in the time it took to get another locksmith to call back, b1 locksmith was at my door, solving my problem. ben was instructive, telling me how to best work with my schlage combination lock (user error caused the problem). i highly recommend their services; they provide expert services and they are efficient and honest!"
5-star,1,"a latch went out on my garage entry door. sent yelp messages to many companies on yelp and then talked to a few on the phone. all were friendly, some told me i could fix it easy etc, but i did not want to. b1 locksmith sent manny over within 30 minutes from when i gave the go ahead. he arrived prepared and professional. they also had the best price. i will use them again in the future."
5-star,1,great service! quickly open my car and helped. a gentleman came and helped me within 20 minutes! got my car open and everything.
5-star,1,"excellent locksmith company! charges were clear up front. i had a very odd lock mechanism that needed repair. dave was great! he spent several hours on it, until it was fixed. dave really cares about doing it right! and, he even took time to talk with us about personal stuff. wish more businesses cared about the quality of their work like these guys do. thank you!"
5-star,1,awesome service everything went perfecr the technician was very speedy and professional i would recommended the service to anyone who needs a good locksmith. they really saved me when i needed help
5-star,1,they responded quickly and were able to fix my broken front door lock at a reasonable price and quickly. also very friendly technician
5-star,1,"the locksmith came quickly and was able to let us into our appartment. he was very nice and professional, and explained the pricing and options to us on arrival. we were able to get back into our appartment relatively quickly (commercial locks are toigh to pick haha) and go about our day. helped turn an unfortunate situation around in a flash."
5-star,1,"had the best experience with dave helping me out today. dave made sure to go above and beyond by taking all the necessary steps to get my car open. he came fast, was totally professional, and honest. recommend this company and dave to anyone else"
5-star,1,they came out on a holiday to help me get into my front door when i was locked out . the technician who was very professional and friendly. i would recommend them to anyone in need of emergency locksmith services.
5-star,1,"i had a really challenging situation and dave was a huge help! he not only patiently helped come up with creative solutions to my problems, he even gave me some ideas that would save me money in the future! dave knows his trade well, but he is not just a great locksmith. he is a great person. i really appreciate his willingness to think outside the box and the fact that he cares enough about his clients to go the extra mile. and he literally did go the extra mile. after realizing that there was a miscommunication about one of the locks i had rekeyed, he came back to fix the situation at no additional charge. that is the kind of service that makes you trust a company. i would recommend dave to any of my friends!"
5-star,1,ben was very professional and very easy to work with. this was a difficult job because of the thickness of the door but he was able to figure it out with no problem and replaced the old lock which was jammed with a new one..we were very pleased with the result..thank you.
5-star,1,this was an easy task to check off my list. just purchased a new home and wanted to change out all the locks. found b1 lock on angie's list. made a phone call and quickly had an appointment set for the next day. the person answering the phone was very professional and knowledgeable. she explained their pricing very clearly. the technician arrived on time and was very knowledgeable and quick. all four door were changed out in less than 20 minutes. what more could you ask for?
5-star,1,"fast service, these guys are awesome and got me in my apartment in a 100+ degree heat! i got locked out and my apartment maintence couldnt help me at all, but these guys did. highly recommended! call these guys!"
1-star,0,"they said that they will give me 50% discount, but they said it doesn't include car lockout, wtf. it coast me 60$ after 5 discount. and then they said give us a good rate on yelp. first of all i have to choose to write you to a rate a good rate or no not you are forcing me or in another ward convincing me to write you this. that is called bribing."
5-star,1,b1 locksmith helped me get into my house and get into my car very quickly. they are very professional and made me a key for my vehicle after i lost it! if i ever loose my keys again i would definitely call him back!
5-star,1,"this was such a great experience. i was refereed to b1 locksmith by a friend & am so happy i went with them! i will never use another locksmith company. i called at 8am on a friday morning (memorial day weekend) and they were here within an hour. ben was fast, honest, kind, and professional. not only that, but they were so much less expensive than any other company! he showed me his id & business card before coming into my home, and was done with five locks within just a few minutes. i cannot say enough about how fantastic my experience was."
5-star,1,"they came quick and very professional, did the job very good. the technician is friendly and explain all of my options. i recommend this company, they respond very fast in the tempe area and the prices are competitive."
5-star,1,"he was fast, nice, professional and he made me an original key for my ford fusion. the dealership would have charged me more. he came when other locksmiths made us wait and then i called b1 locksmith they came in 30 min!! the key was ready in 20 min, the price was reasonable as well!! thanks, really recommended!"
5-star,1,lost my cars key couple days ago called several locksmiths they were all either to busy or charging way to much. got a hold off b1 locksmith spoke to ben he was able to help me out find the key i needed quickly and the price was really reasonable got the job done quick.. thank you
5-star,1,made me a key super quick and even fixed my horn!! ben is a good locksmith and they do honest work i could appreciate. ill definitely use this service if needed again.
5-star,1,"our sliding glass door locked us out and needed a locksmith at 11pm at night. i took a chance on b1locksmith, ben arrived in 30 minutes and was friendly and professional. after further discussing the locks in our home, we decided to hire ben to rekey all the locks. i will not hesitate to recommend ben to my family and friends, definitely one of the good guys."
5-star,1,ben was awesome and friendly!! he came to me and was able to get the new key made in a few minutes. service was top notch and i would definitely use again. great price too!
1-star,0,do not trust this company. they are a bait and switch type. i was charged $469 for a single lock to be rekeyed. then when asked if i would write a review the technician pulled up the review page on my phone and filled it out himself. i then called the company to complain and spoke with owner ben who was completely rude and unprofessional. reading other reviews from this company they look like they were all written by the same person. do not use b1 locksmith.
5-star,1,"caught myself in a pretty bad situation by losing my keys to my car and not having a spare. i contacted b1 locksmith and ben was at my door before i even had a chance to get dressed. he was extremely fast and diligent and i really appreciated how quickly he finished the job. i'm really hoping i don't need to call a locksmith ever again (fingers crossed!) but if i do need to, i'm definitely contacting them again. thanks again ben!"
5-star,1,"manuel gave great service. he was on time, courteous, and professional. i recommend this company. i'll be throwing them some business if anyone needs a locksmith. great job."
1-star,0,"they damaged my car today. waited for the manager for 45 minutes, and then when i spoke to him, he yelled at me for 20 minutes saying it wasn't their fault. there is a huge chunk of paint missing from my passenger door that wasn't missing before. i would know, since this is a brand new vehicle. the manager refused to give me a refund for the car wash."
1-star,0,just got my jeep washed and it was horrible. my bumper and fenders we're not shined at all. i also had to tell them to vacuum inside again. i'm very disappointed with bj's.
1-star,0,"paid for the $35 wash. ended up being rushed at the end and drove away not realizing that they didn't clean my cup holders, vaccuum the back seat or the trunk, didn't clean the side mirrors, and basically did less than there cheapest car wash. i've used them several times out of convenience but i'm done after this one."
1-star,0,do not leave valuables in car! they stole my pistol! i will never be returning here. i caught them and they denied it. by the time police showed up the video surveillance had conveniently been deleted. not trustworthy! i did not get my firearm back!
2-star,0,car wash is a car wash. went here because they offered a coupon on there website. if you want to be harassed by the auto glass replacement guy the entire time you wait for your vehicle... then this is your place. wouldn't leave me alone even after i told him i would complain to the manager and post a complaint online. car wash and service is respectable. the harassment you go through for it is not worth my time. last time i go here.
2-star,0,"dear mr. bj!! my issue with this place is the ""service writers"". these guys have made a career out of checking a box and writing a price on a piece of paper which is why now i kinda understand why it costs 20.00 for a car wash. recently i pulled in and drove past the dude up to the car in front of me. well, that must have pissed him off that he had to walk a few feet to greet me. he filled out the slip without asking me what kind of service i would like and without a word handed it to me and left. what the what?!? (news flash bub, customers like it if they are greeted with a friendly welcoming attitude) then as i was waiting for the car to finish vacuuming in front of me i went to throw some trash in a garbage can a few feet away he opened my passenger door reached over and turned off my engine, so immediately i had to restart my vehicle to move forward. i've been going here for a few years and have been treated with rudeness before so now i'm done with these yayhooos. one more thing, they cant seem to grasp the concept of first come first served either."
1-star,0,long story short i went in and took my wife audi for a oil change and when i picked it up they had noted on tha receipt tha it stated oil leak so i didn't really pay to much attention to it !! few day later notice a oil stain in my garage about 12inch by 12inch i knew something was not right went back to bj left car there i was called back and was told i should just take to my mechanic ! so i did and guess what it was tha oil pan screw was not tightened properly after they changed my oil bj didn't even bother to check it when i dropped it off thxs for nothing ! what if my engine would of blow then what bj i'm sure you would of came up with some bs !! bj lost my business look out for oil leaks after getting service done here!!!!
3-star,0,"i come here often to get a nice easy wash for my old truck. don't really do anything fancy since mostly just need a quick spray and wipe down. the car wash attendants are always nice and friendly. the cashiers are helpful and attentive, never fill like they are just there to take your money and send you on your way. my only issue here is the pushy windshield guy. i have never been a fan of him or his method of selling. often times he will be the first person to greet me as i drive up and ask what i'm here for and then spot a chip in my windshield and ask if i want him to fix. i usually politely say no and hope that is the end of it. there have been a few times where he picked at the chip in the windshield which i didn't think was needed or necessary. i am a fan of all the other services here besides the windshield people. need a quick wash come early to get the early bird special."
1-star,0,"avoid this place !!!! i was given a $120 detail gift certificate as a gift. my car is a brand new car. i have had it for 3 months but used the gift certificate to get all the dead bugs off my car after a weekend trip to san diego. my car is very clean inside, no pets or smoking and it is garaged at school and home . took it in at noon today and they called to have it picked up at 5pm. when i got home i was furious to see the horrible job they did. all i asked was for them to take off the bugs from the grill and hood. they did not do that . they covered the baked in bugs with wax and they scratched my windshield! my car is still covered in bug debris but now there is a layer of wax on top plus a scratched windshield that they blamed on rocks. my car looks worse and is now damaged. came in for a car wash came out with a damaged brand new car . avoid this place ."
2-star,0,"got my truck washed with ""the works"" package. disappointing, especially for the price. if you have high standards for car cleaning, i wouldn't bother with this place. streaks and cloth lint all over my windows and paint. the workers i interacted with were kind of rude. might be a fluke experience, but it's what happened. i won't be back."
1-star,0,"this place doesn't even deserve 1 star! on top of the slowness (on their slow days at that), they do a pretty crappy job cleaning the interior. i just recently went there again, mainly because of the convenient location to where i live and once again, they took forever. then i leave and notice smudges on my windows, but dismissed it at first, but when i got home and went to clean these smudges off, i realized they weren't smudges but that my tint had lots of nicks all over it. i went back and asked for a manager. he said it's from my seat belt hitting the window over a period of time. what's funny is my passenger window has them too and i never have a passenger in the car 98% of the time. and i've ejected the seat belt over and over and never once does the metal buckle come close to the window. if this has been going on over a period of time, i must be practically blind to have never noticed these marks in my tint. he's so full of it! he even went to their tint shop and got a guy to confirm that he was right. of course he agreed and then offered to replace the tint for $90. this is absolute bullsh*t, and so is this business. i will be further pursuing this matter."
2-star,0,i'm sure the service is fine but after the 9th time of the guy asking me about me windshield and me saying no i lost it and just left. do not recommend until they learn that no means no.
1-star,0,update: im still here waiting for my car after being told no detail just wash... it has been another 30 minutes. i asked to speak with a manager and spoke w a guy named alex. i asked why my car isn't ready and that i need to go find someone else to do a detail. he apologized and said i could bring it back tomorrow and he'd knock $20 off. i wanted it done today like i was told so probably going to pass. i am here now and was planning on getting an oil change and an entire car detail. i have been here for about 45 minutes and on different occasions employees tried to get me to purchase other services. that's not why i'm posting a bad review although that is annoying. the reason for my bad review was after my oil change was completed i was called to the front desk and was told they don't have time to do my detail today. what????? i wouldn't have even let them do my oil change had they told me that at the beginning...i would have went somewhere else that could do both!! i'm very p*ssed right now!!
1-star,0,"i am very disapointed with the way i was treated at this car wash last week and i have put in a complaint to the bbb and this company has had my complaint for a few days and has decided to do nothing with it. i want people to know that they don't treat their customers right. first i purchased a full detail which included wax, carpet shampoo, and everything else. i kept asking the guy are you sure these stains can come out? are you sure? i have tried to get these stains out and they have not came out and i'm pretty good at getting stains. he tells me over and over again yes unless it's coffee those stains are coming out. i then asked about the black running down each side of my van. ""oh yeah that'll be gone and if it's not gone we'll re-do it"". then he tells me 1 1/2 to 2 hours. which is reasonable. i have my son with me we go in and wait and wait and almost 5 hours later it's done. i get in my car it looks like a $20 wash was done. my carpets are still all dirty, there's armor all over the place, each tire they missed a huge section when cleaning them, my carpets still had debri on them so they didn't even do a good job vacuuming. i take it straight back to scott and he says oh it's his fault he gave them too much work to do today. i told him how long i waited and he didn't seem to even care. he tells me to bring it back the next day which was fri and he would have them redo it. he only needed an hour. so i do that. we bring it back friday morning and i drop it. i give him 2 hours. i come back i have to search for my keys. when i go over to where they detail an employee says we don't know and i said well who do i ask? then another employee comes over and says, ""hey the white mini van is here, the one we already did yesterday that she took home dirtied up and brought back for us to clean again"". then another guy came up with my keys (red) and said sorry to me. i was so upset i started crying. i could't believe that he had said that. i showed scott before i even left there. i got in my van and drove it straight to scott again. what's funny is my floors were not touched. nothing was different. they didn't do anything they said they were going to do. i even have pictures. i told him everything and he was just like well i can go get the mananger and the other guy came over the one that promised all the stuff and kept saying well, we can fix it. are you kidding me. i am not going to stay here another minute. it's crazy because i have been taking my cars here for while, but never got the detail. customer service is definetely not there. i don't know why they promise things they cannot deliver on. i filed a complaint and they are ignoring it. i am only asking for $60 back from the $128 i paid them since they didn't even do a full wash on my car. they are ignoring me now though. not right. i didn't even get a call or anything."
2-star,0,"wait wait wait. don't come here if you're in a hurry. needed an oil change and alignment. took 2+ hours. not terrible until you consider the 4 guys standing around looking at their phones. i'm not actually sure i needed an alignment, but since i just got new tires, figured it couldn't hurt. when they were done i asked for the alignment report but was told they don't have a printer to print it. the tech couldn't tell me what adjustments were necessary, if any. the only people who weren't rude were the cashiers. not coming back here again."
1-star,0,six cars waiting. one guy doing all the vacuuming. three guys standing around with their heads up their butts. this place blows! if i wasn't so strapped for time i wouldn't choose this place. its just the closest one to me. grrrrrrr!
2-star,0,"this place is super slow,don't go here unless you have all day!! then after that wait my car isn't even vacuumed very well and it wasn't that dirty!!!geeze"
4-star,1,"i have been here several times. from car wash to windshield repair. they have always been good to me and my van, so today i decided to get my oil changed to. i was really impressed. they brought my filters out to show me they needed to be replaced. didn't sell me anything i didn't need. i will defiantly be back"
1-star,0,"i went to bjs and requested a basic car wash and oil change. i went back to pick my car up and they had detailed my car subsequently charged me for the detail of my car, waxing, and additional services that i did not request, or agree to. the paper i signed was for a total of about $40 and trying to be accommodating i agreed to pay $93, which legally they could have never got me to pay more than $40, but as said i was trying to be accommodating. what really irritated me was after i agreed to pay the $50 over they were not at all understanding, talked down to me as if i were the one being rude and even began discussing the situation in another language right in front of me. mistakes are understandable but being completely rude on top of it for a mistake made on their end is just completely poor service. i will never come back here again."
1-star,0,"went to get an oil change and pulled into the parking spots just to the south of the service bays as i figured they would need to pull the vehicle into the bay for servicing. there are no signs and it never once occurred to me that i would need to pull into the car wash entrance to get an oil change. i walked past the car wash people and was asked if i needed help. told them i needed an oil change and he said to go inside and they would help me. got inside and saw a bj's employee practically sitting in some girls lap talking across from the service counter. stood at the counter for a couple minutes and a serviceman came in and asked me if i had been helped. i said no and he said that the guy across from us would help me. he tells me to go get my car and pull it into the carwash entrance. so i pull the car up and ask the carwash guy why he didn't tell me that in the beginning. he said i am just the auto glass specialist and didn't know. so the auto glass specialist takes all my info and here comes the guy that had ignored me from the beginning. i asked him why i needed to pull my car into the carwash entrance and he said because it was easier for the employees to fill out the paperwork!!! unbelievable! i asked him what about what is easier for the customer? asked why i didn't get a simple, ""i will be right with you sir"" and nothing, no apologies. it was raining, by the way, and he asked me if i needed a car wash. total idiot. he then pulled my car back to the original spot that i had parked and there it sat. meanwhile, inside, i see a gentleman talking to another serviceman and asking questions. the serviceman did not answer him and the gentleman had to ask him if he was able to speak. so then i go to look past the counter to see if my car had moved and a guy who acted like a manager asked if i needed something and i told him that my car was sitting in the same spot as when i first pulled up and that i had an issue with the first guy. he tried defending his guy's lack of customer service by saying his customer had a high dollar repair that he needed to resolve. why can't he give me a simple acknowledgment i asked. manager said that he would talk to him about it. uh huh, right. i see my car finally move to a stall and 10 minutes later it is done. that is the fastest oil change, 18 point inspection, fluid top off i have ever had. i really don't know if they even changed my oil. i think they just put a new sticker on. never going back there for anything."
1-star,0,"they said inside will look like new... just less dirt and new smell.. ""we washed it"", not at all..... ""one and a half hours"", was 3 hours...... the hot dog vender had good dogs...."
4-star,1,i'm going to start by saying that i'm a pretty laid back person. i normally won't fuss about $1 but i was charged for an oversized vehicle. i have a jeep patriot. it isn't even considered an suv. i don't have an extra row of seats. my trunk space is smaller than my old carolla. i haven't even left and can't get over that. on the wash itself. i watched the guy wiped down my car and was extremely impressed. i was so impressed that as he went on i kept adding dollars to the tip. my car looks amazing and couldn't have asked for a better job. i just wished i would have gotten his name.
1-star,0,"would not recommend this place. came in for oil change and a car wash. employees were like vultures, wanted me buy this get the windshield fixed, detail my car even though there was rain in the forecast. i declined, stated i was traveling out of town and just wanted the oil changed. they no longer offer a oil change and wash, stated most people don't want the wash. i was told that the price wasn't much diffent now. had a previous service there about 6 months ago and paid $29.99 for wash and oil change. so i went for the oil change at $28.99 and the works car wash for $16.99. total $45.56 out the door. a far cry from the $29.99 they use to offer. want i got was the shaft., the car went in for the oil change which took about 25 minutes, but then it came out and wentback into the line for vacuuming. did i mention that when i drove in there was onlyone car in line. but now it sat for 25 minutes as 13 other cars drove in got vacuumed and put in to the wash. by the time my car get in the wash they are backed up 4 cars deep in all 4 lanes. my car sits for 30 minutes after it comes out of the wash and no one ever touches it. the kid drying the car right in front of us takes 20 minutes to dry one side of the car he is working on using the air hose to dry with. i have been her almost an hour and a half and my car isn't even being worked on. i ask to speak to a manager and when i tell him my concern he flat tells me that there is no way my car has been there an hour and a a half. but he will get someone right on it. they had my car ready in 5 minutes after i spoke with the manager and it looked like it. the inside hqd not been wiped out clean, seats had not been vacuumed and doors and hand prints on them and remember this was the works package. i guess when they got raided they lost all the quality workers. so no quality work no return business. i would give this place less than one star but yelp forces you to give at least one star. you can believe that i will tell everyone i know about the poor service at bj auto spa,"
5-star,1,my favorite car wash place in glendale. prices are not bad and they have great customer service. the waiting room is huge with a lot of snacks and drinks so that's a plus. i usually go in the morning (before 10) and the wait is about 30 min. i believe they have early bird specials too. check their website for coupons as well ($2 off).
5-star,1,"i've been going to bj's for about 2 years. they've always taken good care of me and made sure that my car was in top condition. i've been through three vehicles during that time (two that i still have) and both of them are serviced, washed and fueled at bj's auto spa. i trust the chevron gas, my truck is super clean and it runs better than ever. from outside service to technical expertise, i can fully recommend bj's auto spa!"
5-star,1,"i like this place and would highly recommend it. i was referred here by a friend who works at a dealership in phoenix. he told to me to check out bjs because my car was no longer under warranty. he told me to get an oil change and lube and have them check out the ""check engine"" light. he said they would check out the car, give me the oil change, and wash the car. and he knew i would be happy with it. he said he always took his older cars there and he was never disappointed. i was skeptical because i have a vw and i had not been able to find a good vw,mechanic in phoenix. they did great work.they replaced a sensor, changed the oil, lube and cleaned the car. the whole thing was done for $200 and it was in and out in a few hours. they gave me a discount on top of that. because the car came in early, sean, josh, ng, explained everything to me and explained my options. they even gave me the old part they took out and that has never happened in phx! this is a great place!"
4-star,1,i have been going to this auto spa off and on since 2006. they have reasonable prices and do a fairly good job. they are open as early as 7am and as late as 6pm. this is my auto spa choice when i need an oil change and want my truck washed and looking great afterwards with the interior and tire dressing. my red truck looks sexy afterwards. it turns me on. lol. for the vip wash and oil change i believe i pay only $33 and that's only if i add a beverage while waiting for my baby to be done. i also barter with them when i need my coolant / transmissions fluids flushed. customer service isn't the best. oil change is quick with no problems. the workers washing and cleaning your vehicle are hard working.
1-star,0,"did the apocalypse happen and i missed it? seriously, this place reminds me of the children of the corn. like time forgot them and they just went crazy and gave up. i remember coming to bjs when i was young and waiting for my dad to have his truck washed and even an oil change. the place was swarming with people and it was actually a decent place to wait for your car. nice chairs, nice carpet, cool car stuff for sale, i think they even had food. i went here recently to get a stud put on my car and it was nice to see they have the same chairs from 20 years ago! they even decided not to wash them, or the carpet for that matter. the place was a ghost town and was full of swap meet type junk for sale. it's as if the owner gave up and stop paying the bills but the workers somehow still get their checks so they show up with no direction and no money to renovate or pay cleaners. glad i don't live near this dump. the neighbors should have it condemned. the owner should man up and close this shop down."
5-star,1,"what a great place to get a carwash! i have been going here for years and it's nice to always see friendly and familiar faces! the guy who writes the ticket up knows me now and knows exactly what i need. i always get a great carwash!! if there is something they missed, i mention it and they get on it right away. my kids love the little play area and the free carousel and like to watch our car go through the wash. i've also got my oil changed and some work on my car and they are very professional and honest. i had went to the dealership one time and they told me all kinds of stuff that was wrong with my car. i then went to bj's and they said i didn't need all that work. they fixed what was wrong and that was it! save me a ton of money! i will definitely continue to go back here!"
1-star,0,"it's hard to tell if they do a good job or not because i was too busy declining services from aggressive salespeople. i had previously purchased a $30 wax. they wanted to upgrade that to a better wax with a detail for $90 (with a ""free car wash""! guess what? if i'm paying $90-$120 the car wash isn't free). when i kept declining the self-described ""great price"" -- he lowered it $20. then the guy asked me ""how much i wanted to pay."" this kind of cheesy insulting bartering should take place in the mercados of tijuana, not at a neighborhood car wash. i was also offered a free windshield replacement with some speech about it not costing me or my inusrance a penny. i will never go back. my wife will never go back. i advise the rest of phoenix do the same."
1-star,0,"parts warranties are only for (3) three months now, make sure you ask. had the same rear wheel bearing go out at 9mo intervals, twice. after pressing them the first time it went out they had me cover labor for $150, which would have been covered if i went to a shop with a 1yr warranty. when it went out again larry was sorry that he couldn't do anything other than have me pay full price for them to do it again, i was already in $600 on a $450 repair. i went to subaru and they said the part still qualified for warranty - this was me speaking directly to the same parts guy larry did 10min earlier. subaru found a seized stud in the rear control arm, that is supposed to be removed for the wheel bearing repair, bennett's got around this somehow and didn't mention the failed part, subaru also found a different grease, in addition to the factory part grease, on the bearing, that they said could have easily caused the failure, both times. i got to pay another $600, $1200 total for one wheel bearing! i liked these guys, for the last 4-5 yrs, even recommended them, but we won't be going back, larry is aware but got the hands in the air look when i went back about the second failure. again parts warranties are only for (3) three months at bennett's, depending on how they put the parts in, it may take as long for it to fail, 12 months is the standard - covering labor, i got to pay labor for it failing in under the 12 months every other shop sets as a warrant period."
5-star,1,"need help from someone you can trust? this is the place. i've had service at bennett's three times in the last year and couldn't be happier. the first time i was in, i got to listen to the guy at the counter (larry) talk to two customers before me. he first gave a man a great explanation of why a repair was complete, but less costly than estimated. then he provided a woman with a very detailed but clear analysis for the condition of a car she had brought in to be looked over before her son bought it. it was easy to see that both customers were happy and felt like they had gotten a good deal and good information. this shop does not talk down to anyone, and they don't bs or schmooze their way through customer interaction. i've had coolant leaks fixed, an intermittent ""check engine"" warning light analyzed and fixed, and a suspension issue resolved. all done timely and at a reasonable price. the other reviews are spot on. this is an honest shop doing really good work, and not looking to gouge you or add on extra services. highly recommended."
5-star,1,matt at bennett's auto is very knowledgable and skilled with bmw's. i brought my car in and he was able to replace the belt along with my driver-side mirror fixed at the perfect timing and good price. i plan on bringing it back to have my breaks and other things done in the future. i highly recommend bennett's to anyone who needs work done on your bmw.
5-star,1,"i took my car here to get my brakes replaced. they did the work quickly and at a good price. i went here on a recommendation from a friend, and now i recommend it to my friends when they need work done."
5-star,1,"told them to replace my belt tensioner due to frequent squeaking after replacing my belt.. they looked around and said,""nope, take the belt back and ask for a new one under warranty"".. charged be $12, and after installing a new belt, turns out they were right. honest guys."
1-star,0,"beware of hidden charges, this is a clear reason that consumers don't trust auto repairs and places like this. run and run fast! follow my rant on facebook with over 16,000 followers."
5-star,1,"my friend recommended big o', and the manager at this location (ernie) earned my trust. i don't think there's anything more positive i could say. ask for ernie."
5-star,1,i came in to this location looking to have my tire repaired. after the guy in the back looked at my tire they told me there was now charge for the repair. these guys are great and have friendly staff. thank you brian and russ for getting me in as fast as possible.
1-star,0,"terrible customer service. came in for an oil change. they told me it would be an hour maybe a little longer. i get that. i didn't have an appointment. however, no updates from them on my vehicle and 2 hours later i'm finally asked to wait in line to make payment before they give me my keys and because my husband was paying over the phone they asked me to step aside (since the transaction takes longer than swiping a card.) he then cashed out 2 other customers behind me in line that had also come in after me and took 2 phone calls before even starting my transaction. and i was told that it was my fault for not having an easier payment method. never coming to this location again."
1-star,0,"i've been to this place twice and each time it was awful customer service. i'm personally a woman who gets a little intimidated coming to an auto shop so as it is i'm anxious. the first time i came to get my tires balanced out. i made an appointment for this but i still sat there for 2 hours. once i asked what the heck was going on the associate just said i was up next. no apology or anything. today i went to get the pressure in my tires checked. 2 guys looked me dead in the eyes but just walked by. am i invisible? when the third guy walked by i called out for him for help. he said he would get someone over in 2 min... the mechanic comes over, doesn't say hi, nothing, checks my tires and says ""you're good."" maybe they were rude because these services are free? that doesn't give them the right to be rude. if i have to pay that's fine, just give me some good customer service!"
1-star,0,came in to purchase a tire and they told me i had to order and it would be 3-5 days. 2 days passes and i call to get an update and he tells me it wont be here for another 5 days putting me at a week driving with a hole in my tire. i explained that a week to get a tire is a lot longer than 3-5 days and they told me that weekends don't count and its business days. i would have loved to have known that before i spent 300.00 on a new tire. because i cant drive for a week without a new tire i had to pay a restocking fee of 20% for a tire that still wont be here for 5 days. we can just say im not happy with the company and i wont be going through them to do anything again!
5-star,1,"go see jesse here at big o, he went out of his way to make me happy and hooked me up with a great deal. everyone there went out of their way to make sure i was happy and got a great product!"
1-star,0,"rip off's!!! they did an oil change for me, inspected my brakes and told be they were fine, but i needed a new water pump for $800!!! lol had it, all my hoses, all my belts, new thermostat and radiator flush for $400!! somewhere else!!! then when i returned the next week because my brakes had been squeaking since they inspected them the week before, they had the balls to tell me it was because i needed new brakes. when i told them their mac has just said my brakes were fine last week, they said i must have driven them hard!! in a week???? took my truck down the street to midas on st rose...they told me i still had 50% left on my pads!!! do yourself a favor....dont do business with these cheese balls!!!!!"
1-star,0,"purchased 4 tires that took 2 1/2 hours to install once in the shop (mounted backs on front). less then 100 miles sense broke, they installed a new one and charged me for labor and replacement part. took the broken censor to another big o shop and they stated that it was very likely cracked during the tire mounting and broke while driving. the shop person said it happens or that i hit a curb and broke it. front service good - shop service very bad. did talk my neighbor out of using this shop and he purchased for new tires from discount. less then $100 censor repair cost you $1,600 sale from the neighbor."
5-star,1,"ernie and trent were able to take care of me immediately. they were professional, friendly and fair! i live 26 miles from big o! i will be back! you rarely see this type of customer service anymore. thanks big o! stephen your technician was so helpful too!"
5-star,1,"i had amazing service. the place was so busy, i had a long wait but there are plenty of restaurants close. they take appts though. they fixed my tire for free. the workers are smart friendly and really knowledgeable. i'm from the south and have a high standard for friendliness and they exceeded it."
1-star,0,i took my car to this location to get the tire pressure checked on my tires. the gentlemen behind the counter told me to just pull my car in to the first bay. so i did. as i was doing this an employee that was working in the garage started yelling at me to not pull in the bay. very rude and unprofessional!! i left! will never be back!!!
1-star,0,"i went in to get a front end alignment with an 11 a.m. appointment. the tech that helped me came out to the car and rubbed his hands on the tires as said there was a problem with your tires and that is why the car is pulling to the right. he said i can do the alignment but it won't help. so i found my extended warranty and managed to get them to cover the 2 tires. so with the sale going on i figured why not see about the other 2 tires with the deal they has of buy 2 get 2 or buy 3 get one. when i figured that scam out (wanting almost as much at the other 2 tires being covered) they add all the other options as mandatory so there is not real 2 free tires just in the fact on the invoice it will show no cost. moving past that, once we had the warranty issue figured out they said they needed to get the tires from another store (why did you not find ones you have in stock at your store first) in the meantime did he give me an offer of what kind of tires i wanted??? nope he decided for me. so my buddy and i run a few errands and go to lunch expecting the car would be completed. nope stuck at home with no car until wife gets home. wasted the rest of my day. come to find out that when i called at about 5p.m. they had not even finished putting on 2 tires. so the wife drops me off 20 minutes later and the car was ready. get all the receipts and go on my way. figured since i was in there for my free alignment check and have it done if that was the problem. again no they never check for the alignment and now it was worse than when i first brought it in. the same tech at that time became very rude because i was pissed that my day was wasted and they did not even take care of what the original problem was check the alignment. so after being wronged he does not even care about customer service to offer me something for his failure to do his job. he asks the most condescending question to a pissed off customer. what do you want me to do for you. well i want you to do your job take care of me and give me the alignment for free.(expecting him to man up and offer a discount.) nope he goes to the chart and says these are the prices which one do you want. the cheap tech did not even offer the original price i was given earlier. so asked who the manager was and he tossed the car at me so i tossed it back to him. that's when he got extremely so i left and called the complaint line on him. but knowing how companies don't care i know they will not even call. so like the saying goes get wronged once shame on you. employing such a rude person when your goal has been making guest feel like family. we you made this one feel like the unwanted family."
5-star,1,"here's why i give big o tires in henderson five stars... because they don't have 10. we've been a customer of this location for about a decade, and the entire family takes their vehicles in for service. i can't stress enough how comforting it is to know that when you send your daughter or wife in that they receive superior service without being overcharged or taken advantage of. i highly recommend them for your out-of-town friends to have their phone number in their phone so they have issues when in town, they simply go in and see those guys especially early and have their issues taken care of efficiently and quickly. if there was a way i could speak to the owner i would tell him all this in person."
5-star,1,"i've been going to these guys for about 4 years now. i trust them, they are friendly and they don't change and arm and a leg. it's nice to have an auto repair shop that i actually trust!"
5-star,1,"came in early looking to get an oil change..attendant was friendly, knowledgable and courteos..had 1 person in front of me so it took about an hour..also in another instance had a nail in the tire...they fixed it for free..overall good service. overall i thought the service was excellent! not the fastest but then again i'd rather my car was done right rather than too quickly.."
1-star,0,2 years ago i took my care there to get new tires they had a great deal! .....bad idea. they talked me into replace brakes as well ....bad idea. the brakes started making terrible grinding noises 3 days later so i took it to midas and they had to replace all of it and stated they the wrong kind of pads. today i discovered the tires they put on the car were not used but already 5 years old when they put them on. i'm having new tires put on again but this time by goodyear.
5-star,1,excellent service! i brought my truck in for tire repair and the wait was longer than expected so i had to leave. i brought in back a few days later and i was not charged for the repair because of the wait.
1-star,0,"went in for an oil change and tire rotation - came out with $1,500 damage done to my car - they put my car on the wrong lift and cracked the evaporation unit under the car! 20 minutes after leaving the shop i noticed my check engine light was on - i pulled over and the coolant was empty. not sure what they actual did with my car while it was there. heard they got a new manager, he was nice enough to refund the oil change, now i have to negotiate with their insurance company on the damages! this shop has issues with their mechanics - don't take you car here!"
4-star,1,"i went here after a terrible experience at another store. it was a sunday so i was worried as i figured they might be too busy to help me. even with people in the shop, chris helped me within 5 minutes. i needed 4 new tires and an oil change and he gave me various quotes for different quality of tires. when i asked about a brand they didn't have in, he called around and located them for me. already a huge step-up from other places. he told me the exact time he 'd have the car ready and even let me know he might be 5-10 minutes behind when i check-up. he also discounted the oil change for me. on top of everything, whoever took my spare off and put in back in the trunk, did so with care and even tried to fix the mess a previous place had made of my tire cover. i will be using these guys again. thanks chris and the guys who helped out. -my only reason for not giving 5 stars is the added cost of installation. $20 is a little steep as i have heard of places who offer half that price, but honestly with the great customer service, it didn't put me off too much."
5-star,1,new management! super happy! i've had a lot of bad experiences with mechanics.... very pleased with how the new manager steve is running the place. i felt like they were honest and gave me the services i asked for! also beat the best prices i could find!
5-star,1,"i have had nothing but positive experiences from this shop. came in last night with a tire emergency about 15 mins after closing. geoff opened the door for me and stayed late until the job was done right. i won't use another shop unless i absolutely have to. if you've dealt with mechanics in the vegas area, you've probably encountered a few that operated using unscrupulous practices. not here. i recommend them to everyone."
2-star,0,they did do the job that i asked but when i first arrived i asked if they had the tires i wanted in stock and they said yes. 2 hours later after waiting and waiting and waiting they admitted that they only had three tires and were waiting for another store to deliver the final one. not honest. wasted my time.
1-star,0,"ladies, avoid this place as though your life depended on it. i happened to drive to vegas for a meeting this summer; my car was vibrating the entire way down, so i stopped in to have this big o shop look at the balance. the car was barely up on the lift when the mechanics decided i needed new shocks/struts (without even looking at it or going through a checklist of all possible balance pathologies?). the car had been serviced the week prior by my trustworthy mechanics in reno -- why would the reno guys not have jump on a pricey repair like struts if it was indeed needed? anyway, who am i to know better? shelled out the $400 for new shocks, and imagine my surprise when i drove away with worse vibration. my mother happened to be with me, so she brought the car back the next day, spoke to new mechanics, and all that needed to be done was replacing some balancing weight clips. what i believe are fraudulent business practices only scratches the surface of my experience at this shop. if you're a member of 50% of the population (read: female), don't visit this place. you'll be disrespected like nothing you've ever encountered."
1-star,0,"came here because discount tire was having a employee appreciation day a couple of months ago. walk in and ask for 4 tires, and also ask if there are any discounts going on at the time. guy says no deals going on, but while he is quoting my price i passively check bigo's website on my iphone and whaddya know? there was a $75 off deal going on when you buy 4 tires. i point it out to the guy and he immediately cuts the price. slime. i should have left then and there, but it gets worse. he quotes me a time of 45min - 1hr. i sit in the waiting room from the 1980's for about 1 hr and check on my car. they hadn't even started yet. frustrated, i went for a walk around the block to starbucks and back. when i came back i sat down in the parking lot to watch the tech work on my car. after finally getting around to my car the tech began to unscrew the tires with reckless abandon and dropping the tires on the ground so that the rims were parallel to the ground! saw me looking at him and took a little more care with the rest, but the damage was done. a couple of minutes later the manager calls me over and tells me that they ""found"" the tpms sensor cracked in half inside of my tire, makes up some crazy lie about how the sensor would still be working because it was rolling around in the tire. (bs) i had no tire light when i came to the shop, but left with one. btw the sensor was $250 dollars. of course the crooks did not offer to replace it but stuck with their story of ""finding it"" that way. so... got 4 new tires wasted 4 hrs and spent extra $250 on tire sensor avoid and go to discount tire"
1-star,0,"my family and i had by far the worst tire experience here! we were there for over 5 hours! when we first arrived they told us an hour and a half, then continued to say a few more minutes every time we would ask to see what was taking so long. long story short, they ended up putting parts on our truck they didn't even talk to us about. the bill came to $1200 and something but we were told $762 when they started the truck. avoid this place, they scammed a poor little old man before us as well, came in for an oil change and ended up spending 5 hours and over $700 dollars to leave again...poor charlie. this place is filthy as well, dead bugs, broken lights, dirt everywhere......go to costco or sams, trust me!"
1-star,0,went back there because i had a flat tire and was towed in. they wouldn't honor warranty on tires. said had too many miles. i had spent $2100 on rims and tires there. they tried to pressure me into buying sumitomo tires which are garbage. i drove across the street to discount tires to avoid their bullshit. they are horrible. this happened 1 1/2 years ago.
1-star,0,"my tire pressure was low and i discovered my tire had gotten a nail in it, so i called around to see who could fix my tire for a reasonable price. i called big o and they said they don't charge for that, since its such a minor repair. so i decided to go with them. i was busy working so my boyfriend on his day off, took my car down there for me to get it taken care of. he noticed it was pretty busy, he ended up waiting almost 2 hours, finally they told him it was all done and informed him that i needed new tires and gave him a quote. so a few days later i noticed my tire pressure going down again, and my boyfriend checked it and saw a nail. the same nail that he took it in to get repaired for, so basically they did nothing but try to sell him some tires and make him waste 2 hours waiting on his day off, and i was driving it unsafely for the rest of my work week. yes he should've checked the tire upon leaving big o, but generally when someone tells you the jobs done, you believe its done. or else what was he waiting for? i guess thats what you get for free ..nothing. so i do not recommend going there for any service if this is the way they do business. terrible way of doing business, terrible service..dishonesty is something you don't want when taking your car in for service. if they would have done the work, we probably would've gotten my tires from them also. but now, never again will i go to a big o. beware."
1-star,0,"i first took my car to this shop because i bought a ittle coupon book with a few free oil change coupons. had my oil changed, and as part of their inspection they suggested i get new rotors and break pads, and showed me why. they quoted over $300 to do this repair, and i felt that was a little high. then, i noticed my oil was leaking. ended up taking it to another mechanic, who did the break work for $170, and said my oil cap was put on poorly. my mother in law then went to this shop as her car battery had died, and was told it would be over $100 to replace - when you can go buy a battery and get it installed from advanced auto parts for $60! i don't know if this shop is dishonest or just really pricey, but i have since taken my business elsewhere."
4-star,1,"i was having brake issues in may 2009 and i was looking for a place to take my car on a saturday morning. i just happened to drive by big o on pecos/windmill. i stopped, the guy said he could look at it right then. long story short, 2 hours and $580.00 later my brakes were done and it was amazing what a difference good brakes make. so this month, the front brakes were sqeaking and grinding so i took it back. they did some work on them(no clue what it was) and did it at no charge which amazed me. it's much better now and he didn't try to sell me something else and it was done in under 90 minutes. this place seems honest and knowledgeable. recommended ! edit: i've been back here 2x this year. my 10 year old pontiac had some brake issues again, and i figured they'd have record of what they'd already done. sadly, i had to spend $900 plus on brakes all round, which really makes a difference in the car!! and now, last week, my ""check coolant"" message was on (well, for the last month, and i kept putting coolant) so i went back here and $750 later, owned a new water pump and all the stuff that goes with it. god, i hate spending money on car repairs. i've always felt good about going here. i always have to wait to have the work done and the waiting room is clean and only smells mildly of grease and tires :) (ps the restroom is clean too). they offer free bottled water, cold, which is a nice change. at any rate, i hope i can sell the car later this year but now i know most of things are working on it!"
1-star,0,"i've had the same issues as some of the other posters. matt never returned calls and was never at the shop. took my car in on june 30, 2015 he had it for a month. car windows were left down and filthy on the inside. we needed a new harmonic balancer and matt finally admitted that when he was timing the car he ruin the head of the engine. he put a new one in and couldn't get the car to start. my husband was finally fed up, called matt with a different number and he answered. matt told my husband he couldn't get the car started to take it to his friends shop, he said he would have the car out back together. wrong! my husband showed up of course matt not there and my husband had to look around the garage to find our missing nuts and bolts. my husband then took the car to global automotive where they told us that parts were on backwards and it was nothing electrical. matt ruin the head again. we had to purchase a rebuilt engine. sad to say we drove the car in and had it towed out! also stuck with a $1,900 bill!"
1-star,0,"i believe an inherent problem with yelp reviews may be that unscrupulous business owners have their friends and family write glowing reviews to help generate business. 5 out of the 6 current reviews for bison are quite favorable. however, it's the one that isn't that is more inline with my experience there. the one star review wasn't there when i first researched bison, only the 4 and 5 star ones. it sounded too good to be true. and, in fact, it was. not too good, just not true. first off let's start with the website. if you visit the bison website, it lends a very upscale impression with both it's writing and graphics. in reality, nothing could be further from the truth. this is a mom and pop backyard operation, albeit from a large metal building in matt's backyard. disorder, dust, and disarray are the theme inside and outside the shop. his teen-aged daughter or wife will run your credit card for the amount due. i have never actually met matt, the owner, only spoke to him on the phone as he was never there. he is pleasant and courteous enough on the phone, until you begin to voice dissatisfaction. then he simply does not answer your calls. but enough on that. i was so impressed by the reviews that i brought 2 vehicles to bison for repair. the first had a coolant leak and a busted motor mount and an issue with the transmission that turned out to be a shift module, a part that sells for around $150.00. that was the most expensive part replaced on the vehicle, but somehow i racked up a bill of over $900.00. after picking up the vehicle i called matt and told him i could still smell antifreeze. he assured me that in a short time the smell would go away. it has been several months now and the smell is still prevalent, and the vehicle still requires additional antifreeze to be added periodically. i will say to their credit the motor mount and the transmission were fixed correctly. these are very straightforward repairs, and it seems in those cases they are able enough. the motor and transmission did not have to be removed to perform repairs on them. so how did i rack up $900.00? there is no work order to itemize repairs, as yelp reviewer andrew c. mentioned in his review. curious how none of the other reviews mentioned this. vehicle #2 had overheating issues and an air conditioner problem. the air was fixed, the overheating kind of fixed, it overheats less frequently now. this is not an old car, it's a 2011 model that we bought new. when the vehicle was returned, there was a warning light on that was not on when we dropped the car off. it was a bad battery warning light. i had purchased a new battery from aaa two years prior, and they have an excellent warranty. aaa came to my home, checked the battery and said it was marginal, so they replaced it free of charge. however, this did not make the warning light go out. i called matt back and asked when i could bring the car back so they could fix the problem they caused, and he informed me they were very busy, and it was very hot inside the shop. after that, he quit answering my calls, as yelp reviewer andrew c. also mentioned. this time the bill was north of $750.00. in closing i would just say that you can do better elsewhere. i don't see how taking it to the dealership could be anymore expensive. and, at least at the dealership there is accountability for the work performed."
1-star,0,"i had a very similar experience to shawn. i took my truck to matt for thr same ongoing issue 4 times. i paid $620 and all i got was the incorrect parts installed, windows left down and a interior with dust and dirt all over it. matt will not answer or return phone calls for his shoddy work. i highly suggest you test drive your vehicle and demand a invoive (he doesnt provide them) before you pay this guy any money. i am currently filing a report with the attorney general to get my money back, i dont see this guy in business for much longer."
5-star,1,took my suv in recently. very quick to diagnose and relay info. made sure that all isues were fixed and that it was safe as it is my car to transport the children. very fair priced and honset. also super quick had my car back very next day! will definitely be using again for my vehicle needs! we now have a car person after a move to a different area!!
5-star,1,"i am not one who takes the time to write a review however matt & the guys at bison automotive are honest trustworthy and dependable and will forever (or at least as long as i live within driving distance to his shop) be my mechanic!!!! my family moved here from utah just over 6 years ago where i worked with a mechanic in the family to fix all our cars. when we moved to arizona it was hard to find a mechanic who would listen and wouldn't try to repair things that i knew didn't need repair. we all know how hard it is to find a trustworthy and good mechanic let alone a great one. i have lived in buckeye for over 3 years and the guys on matts crew are exactly what buckeye needs a good and trusted shop we can count on when (not if) our babies konk out. my volvo is my baby and i treat it that way so when her transmission was having issues i took her to the dealership (joke) & to a ""friend"" both wanted to charge me nearly $3000.00 the dealership $150.00 just to plug it in not!! thanks to yelp i found bison automotive. i can not tell you how refreshing it is to talk to a mechanic who actually listens and doesn't discount any diagnosis made by someone other than themselves, one who lives the golden rule matt and his crew not only beat the previous bids but he had it in and out of the shop in 3 days and it would have been less if he wasn't forced to wait for parts from volvo that were a day and a half later that promised. matt is working on a new shop i hope he finds one close but if not we will drive to where ever he goes!!!!! thank you guys!!!!!"
5-star,1,great service. speedy and efficient at a good price. we took my daughters car there and matt and his crew had us repaired and on the road in no time. we look forward to him expanding his shop.
5-star,1,"matt fixed the air conditioning in my honda pilot. wilhelm was going to charge me nearly twice what bison's charged me. on top of charging me so much less, he walked me through the estimate that wilhelm gave me and explained to me what they were charging me for and why he didn't think it was necessary or did think it was necessary to change and replace everything wilhelm identified. i appreciated the honesty! matt also completed the job in just a short afternoon! i had a great experience. you will too."
5-star,1,"i cannot say enough about these folks and this business. first, they sell spectacular cars. hardworking, gorgeous cars. i use mine for garden supplies, pets and pet supplies, hauling bikes and getting dirty and probably most important, long solo road trips where reliability and safety is essential. the staff from the top down is professional, accessible, efficient and knowledgeable. i never worry that the service dept will do more or less than necessary."
3-star,0,"i generally do not write reviews, but i feel compelled to share my experience with the consumers that are out there considering bobby rahal as their auto dealer. i have leased my cars for the past 6 years, and finally decided that it was time to invest in a car that i'd have for a while. i test drove 8-10 different cars to make sure i knew what qualities were important to me. i decided on the volkswagen gti, and i found what i thought was the perfect car - right color, right miles, right features - on cars.com at bobby rahal's dealership in wexford, pa. the dealership was a distance away, but i figured that it was worth inquiring about. so, i did... i called the number on the ad, and dave derose was the salesperson to reach back out to me via text message the following day. dave and i spoke about the car, and he convinced me that the car was well worth the 5 hour drive to get to wexford from maryland. i asked him for his honesty, and said that i didn't want any surprises... i wanted to know that the car was going to be exactly as described, and there wasn't anything that i should be aware of before making the trip. dave's exact words were, ""not in the least. the car is perfect, except for a little curb rash on one wheel and my guy is here now fixing it. i called him when you committed to purchase. i'm standing beside it right now. our dealership does not sell anything that we would put our reputation on the line for."" so, i was convinced. i trusted dave. i thought, ""well, he's confident, so that makes me feel confident"". i had him send over the paperwork; i signed them and sent them right back. the following day, i called my bank and had them wire over the funds for the full amount of the car. i thought, ""i have nothing to worry about"". wow, was i wrong! my boyfriend and i arrived at the dealership on saturday afternoon. i had been texting with dave for the past few days, so i was excited to meet him, and thank him for his fantastic service. as we were pulling up, i receive a text from dave, saying that he called out sick that day, but in his words, ""all is ready to go"". at the time, i didn't think much of it. i walked into the dealership, filled with anticipation - this is the first car that i had ever really sought out... i had inquired, researched, and negotiated the deal all by myself, and that was a big thing for me! i was so happy and excited to bring my new car home with me, and to show it off to my family and friends whom i had spent the past few days bragging with. brandon collins, the pre-owned sales manager, met us and had the car pulled around. we went out to the car, and a cloud of disappointment flushed over me. this ""perfect"" car not only had the worst curb rash i'd ever seen on a wheel, but also had a large, approximately 16"", scrape above the tire, as well as on the rear door handle. there was also a crack on the right turning signal light. as we continued to inspect the car, the damages kept mounting. there was a quarter-sized crack in the windshield, there was a large crack on the interior driver-side door, there was water inside the center console, indicating that the sun roof may have a leak. we were outwardly upset. i couldn't believe this was happening! my perfect car was a fraud! dave had lied, and because he had called out that day, brandon was left to take the heat. needless to say, we left without a car that day, but what i can say is that brandon made the best out of the worst situation. he sat down with us, offered to reimburse us for our trip, apologized profusely, and did everything he could to make us feel understood. i received my refund check today, via overnight fedex, along with the trip reimbursement, a hand-written apology note, and a $150 giftcard to morten's steakhouse. brandon went above and beyond. he's one of the good guys - it was his service, not to mention his compassion, that saved the reputation that dave had so carelessly put on the line. sincerest of thank you's, brandon!"
5-star,1,"brandon collins & bob guckert at volvo in wexford are very sweet, funny, kind and very accommodating. they strive to make sure the purchase is smooth and everything was perfected on our gl450. i strongly recommend this duo. i've never laughed so hard during a sale!! i just purchased a new car from them a few weeks ago and i can't wait to go back!"
5-star,1,6/16 - my car got a few scratches from traveling tonyc. i took it to bobby rahal and they were able to get the scratches out within a day and free of charge. i will continue to keep coming back. i've had my volvo serviced at bobby rahal many times and each time i have received excellent customer service. i wouldn't trust my car with anyone else. the staff and quality of service keep me coming back.
5-star,1,"i've bought 3 cars over from bobby rahal over a ten year period and had service there for as long as the cars were under warranty. plusses: sales. they are very straightforward. they can answer technical questions about vehicles. they offer a good deal from the outset. they don't try to get you to pile on extended warranties, extra coatings, etc. service. always competent. loaner cars available. they wash the car as part of the service. minus: the service is expensive, but that's just the way it is with volvo service. once i've had cars go off warranty, i take them to my local garage."
5-star,1,"realizing this dealership caters to high end cars, i hesitated going in to check out a used dodge. fortunately my salesman was alex moussa. i explained to him my budget constraints and he could not have more understanding and helpful. i recommend alex without any reservation. thank you alex!"
5-star,1,"i drove my sister here to buy a car (close to an hour and a half). the salesman, alex, was extremely nice and thorough with everything. overall, i thought the service was great and the car was really nice."
5-star,1,"i have purchased two volvos from bobby rahal. the first one the car sold me, the second one, the dealership sold me...especially the service department. i am a major car buff and have owned a lot of cars in my life and dealt with various dealerships. my experiences at bobby rahal can be summed up in one word. outstanding!!! the dealer service has been second to no one that i have ever dealt with. in fact it is not just the service but the entire dealership as a whole. from the minute you walk in the door it is not just a visit but an experience. the last two times i have needed service they have been somewhat at the last minute. the first was a convertible top that would not go up and the second was a tire blow out and a faulty tire pressure monitor system. the service department bent over backwards to accommodate me, i did not have an appointment but was taken in immediately. the service manager, shop foreman, and service writer took immediate ownership of my problem and not only resolved it in an extremely timely manner but far surpassed what i had expected as an outcome. i have recommended bobby rahal to friends many times and will continue to do so. in so far as a premier dealership they are far and above anyone else in pittsburgh. bar none... the best experience i have ever had with a service department!!"
1-star,0,"my husband was shopping for a new used vehicle when his truck decided it didn't want to work anymore, so we went to bobby rahal to look at their used vehicles. we found one, a bmw x3 2008 in our price range with a warranty and purchased it. the next day lights started coming on the dashboard and it threw a code (we checked it with our reader). we called the warranty people (who were off because it was columbus day), once we finally got a hold of them they set an appointment at the bmw dealership. we kept the appointed and received a call telling us on a $11,900 car there are $6400 in repairs. the car had passed inspection in september. this was not an as is car. to end my story, the car is still in the shop, and we have had very little communication with the dealership or the warranty people. the shop that has the car told us no one is returning his calls either. i know this is a high end dealership and we bought used, but i thought that with the reputation and cost of the vehicles we would have better customer service. no communication and 1/2 the price of the car wrong within a day after purchasing the vehicle? i am so disappointed with this company. i don't know how they treat people who purchase new, but we have had nothing but problems and it seems no solution in sight."
1-star,0,"0 stars. don't walk, run from bobby rahal's service center. brought our s60 in for one repair and a new and major braking problem became immediately obvious upon driving off the lot. dealer claimed to have test driven the car so it is mind boggling how they could have released it to us with such an obvious and potentially fatal flaw. when we asked for an explanation and repair of the problem, we got a call from the service manager who refused to accept any fault and tried unconvincingly to defuse blame on a worn bushing in the most unprofessional, defensive and discourteous manner. the way the car surged to the right upon braking could not have been explained by any of the excuses given, none of them stacked up. hands down this was the worst customer service i/we have ever experienced."
5-star,1,"even though i live almost an hour away from bobby rahal, i love this dealership so much that i always bring my car out here! the customer service is second to none. adam generally helps us out, and he is fantastic. he will communicate with both my husband and me. i also love that i can always get a loaner car... though i do wish they were volvos. if i drove a loaner s60 around for a day or two, i bet i would consider purchasing one very soon! bobby rahal also sends out coupons pretty regularly. they are great when you have to have a big repair done. (now if only i could ever remember to take the coupons with me!) if bobby rahal costs more than going to a local service place, i don't care. the service is just that good!"
4-star,1,"the guys in the service department always take great care of me and my family. adam, matt and rob are very friendly, professional, and honest. these guy go above and beyond to make sure you are happy with your volvo, no matter where you bought your car. the waiting area is clean and has cold water bottles and lots of magazines to read. it's better than most service waiting areas but not as nice as many luxury car dealership waiting areas. every time i bring my car in i take time to look at the new volvos, jags, and land rovers. the entire sales team is friendly and not pushy. my only gripe is that the service loaner cars they give are not as nice as the loaners i have had at other volvo dealerships. it would be nice if they loaned cars that made you want to get a new car and not just wish for your car back. all-in-all, i'd say they are much better than the other volvo dealership in the pittsburgh area."
2-star,0,"fairly average volvo dealer service. pretty fair pricing, and they seemed honest. i only had a standard 60k service done - no major work. i'd have given them 3 stars, but i have to bump them down one for two things. when i went to pick it up, one of the staff brought the car around to me and had it idling outside of the office. i jumped in, and it seemed to be idling slightly rough. i thought i might have been imagining things, but when i pulled out to leave, there was obviously something wrong - definite misfires. i left it overnight, and it turns out that they'd put in a bad plug as part of the service. no big deal, but it's pretty clear that they didn't test drive it after their work. (not sure how the guy who drove it around didn't notice it, either before he left me with it.) they were nice about it and didn't try to charge me anything for it and apologetic, but it's still a fairly big error. the other issue was smaller but just points to inattention to detail: i noticed a week later that they left the caps off of my tires. again, they were nice about it when i went back and put some new ones on, but they should've caught it before. (i wouldn't have commented on this had they not already made the other mistake.)"
4-star,1,service was friendly! very customer oriented. they we're a little slow with completing an alignment. it took about 1 hour and 30mins even with a scheduled appointment on a weekday not during rush hour or lunch either. very reasonably priced as well. $49.95 for an alignment with the online coupon.
5-star,1,went during my lunch break hoping i could get worked in for an oil change ( which i was a bit overdue for.) was told by louie that they could definitely work me in and that it should be about a hour. i decided to wait for my car and it actually ended being less than what he originally quoted me. i really like the fact that i was not pressured to add or buy additional services than what i had originally came in for. all in all i was able to get in and out during my lunch break hassle free! highly recommend 'brake masters' and speaking with louie to take care of your vehicle needs. i will for sure go back!
5-star,1,effective efficient and professional. i have an audi q7 which needed breaks and rotors changed. the quote from audi was $2800 plus taxes. i got all that done for all four wheels + complete servicing under $1000. as promised on time . great place for any of your car needs
5-star,1,"i had another fantastic experience here! juan was awesome and so was the manger on duty! these guys are super friendly and fast! i will be returning here for future services since the customer service experience was one of the greatest i've had!! it's hard finding a place to go when you're a lady, that the guys don't try to take advantage of you by selling you products or services that you don't need. go here ladies for repairs and services!"
2-star,0,"yeah, i just don't know about this place. i went in for an alignment and had a few issues. i will say, the staff is super friendly and accommodating and they wound up refunding my money but i kind of had to fight with them a little. they were so nice to fit me in same-day and the time they quoted me for the repair was accurate. like i said, i went in for an alignment and they completed the work. as i was driving home, i noticed my car was going to the left when i kept the wheel straight, so i made a u-turn and headed back to the shop and explained what was happening. the guy at the front test drove it and said that nothing was wrong and to drive in the middle lane and see if it still pulled...so that's what i did and it did the same thing so i brought it back again and this time i suggested a test drive with the technician. the technician came out and asked for my keys and was like, ""oh, you're going to come?!"" i said yeah, i want to show you. so anyway he hopped behind the wheel and told me the same thing...""it's not pulling and everything is ok..."" frustrated, i asked him to pull over so i could show him. we watched as the car dashed across three lanes of traffic when i held the wheel straight. when we got back to the shop he didn't really seem thrilled but put the car back up on the lift. about 5 minutes later the manager comes out with a piece of paper showing me the numbers. i explained that i understood what the computer says and what the piece of paper says but the car is pulling to the left and it isn't right. he tried to blame it on torque steer...which is ridiculous. i told him that torque steer is only under heavy acceleration and the likelihood of it being torque steer on a prius is ridiculous. i told him that i would bring it somewhere else, have it fixed, and dispute the charge. we agreed that he'd refund my money if another shop could do better. the manager said that i would not be able to do any better than what he was showing me. he wound up having to eat those words. poor guy. on sunday i brought the car to pep boys who showed it out of alignment on the left side by 0.06° and on monday i brought it to brakes plus who showed it out of alignment by the same number. i had brakes plus perform the work and went back to break masters with this info and they refunded my money. break masters' alignment is inexpensive...i believe i paid $49.95 after a $20 off coupon but you get what you pay for, it seems."
1-star,0,brake masters? more like break masters. this place is definitely not the place to get even the simplest job done because they will screw you over. they will lie right to your face and will not look you in the eyes. sure they have nice little coupons ready to help you out but you definitely get what you pay for. they will not give you the full invoice i.e exactly what they did and how many hours of labor they completed. they don't know what they are doing and they will break your car and not tell you. please for the love of your car do not take your car here because they will ruin it and you will end up with a large bill for stuff they damaged.
5-star,1,this location is the friendliest and they have never steered me wrong. i have been going here for over 5 years and have always had a pleasant experience no matter who i deal with. i would definitely recommend them to family and friends!
5-star,1,you will always have me as a committed customer. thank you and your staff for your professionalism and honesty. you guys are awesome!
1-star,0,"this company offers very poor customer service. i say the company as a whole because there was an incident that occurred while my vehicle was being serviced at this location that required me to take the matter to the corporate level, whom also exhibited very poor customer service. a few weeks ago, i took my car in to be serviced. the store manager, john, cussed in an exasperated tone when i told him that there was a part on my car that had been broken while it was being serviced. he deflected all responsibility and stated ""i could be a not so nice guy and say that it was wear and tear of the vehicle...i guess i'll just eat the cost of this."" he was visibly agitated/frustrated with the situation, and despite his crass, condescending response to the incident, it seemed like he was going to replace the part and take care of it. however, john was never once apologetic and stated that he'd be in touch with me regarding the part, had his tech ""do the best he could to 'fix' the part temporarily"" and sent me on my way. he followed up the next day and told me that ""his guy didn't break the part intentionally"" so i [the customer] ""would have to buy the part at wholesale cost from him and he'd be willing to install it at no charge."" he said that's the best he could do...mind you, he just admitted fault by saying his ""guy didn't break it intentionally."" at this point i decided to take this matter to his supervisor, as i felt that i shouldn't have to pay anything because 1. i didn't break it 2. my car was in their care while it was being serviced 3. he admitted fault. apparently his supervisor was out of town so i spoke to the corporate customer service rep, timothy harphant (who called back a day later). i explained the situation to him. he stated that he would speak to the store manager to get his statement and requested pictures of the damaged part. (note: the pictures and video that were sent were of the part after the tech had messed with it and attempted to ""fix it"", so the damage was not accurately depicted). timothy called back (yet another day later) and stated that after speaking with the store manager, he agreed with him, that it was general wear and tear of the vehicle and stated that the best he could do is what the store manager, john, offered me...""free installation"" of the part, which he stated would be at least an hour and a half of labor (for a part that would literally take 15-20 minutes to install) and i'd have to pay for the part that his employee broke. he didn't care that they admitted fault or that he made this decision using an inaccurate depiction of the damaged part. i later called back to see if he would at least approve for me to have the part installed at a different store, as i didn't feel comfortable going back to the store where i felt mistreated and taken advantage of. timothy never called back after multiple messages left. the part on my car is still broken, and i have yet to hear from anyone at brake masters. to say that i was dissatisfied with this company is an understatement. i will never take my car back to another brake masters and will advise any of my friends, family, coworkers, acquaintances, neighbors, fellow social media networkers, or simply anyone asking me for a referral to a mechanic shop of any kind to look elsewhere for quality care and outstanding customer service. because brake masters won't give that."
5-star,1,i love these guys!! my brakes were making a loud noise and i dropped my car off with john. i was so worried it was going to cost me an arm and a leg...but they didn't charge me anything once they realized it was something very minor. i was so surprised they didn't charge me anything...it's hard to find honest mechanics and these guys proved honesty still lives. thank you john and the team at brake masters.
1-star,0,i would not recommend this location! i took my truck here to get my front brakes replaced and brake fluid changed. not long after the 90 day warranty my truck started to wobble when braking. i had to take my truck in to the toyota dealership for an unrelated reason which was under warranty and the service manager told me that my rotors are warped which is causing the wobble and that the brake fluid needs to be changed. after i inspected the brake fluid it was changed with new fluid but brake masters did not clean the fluid reservoir before putting in the new brake fluid so it looked dirty from the outside. for the cost of the service provided i would not recommend this place. stay clear!
1-star,0,"if there was a rating of negative stars, i'd use them. thoroughly disgusted with the level of professionalism, customer service, and integrity at this place. brought my car in for a simple oil change and tire rotation. it was overdue, but still. i sat in the waiting room for almost two hours while they did this. one of their techs kept coming in and complaining about the cars he was working on and how dirty and under maintained they were (seriously???), while another tech was on the phone complaining about the number of hours his employees were working. after all of this, they quoted me $1,027.64 worth of work that needed to be done on my rear brakes. this was for both brakes drums to be completely replaced and a new master cylinder. not having the extra $1,000 to spend, i paid for my oil change and left. i took it to another mechanic for a second look and he couldn't find any thing wrong, aside from a small fluid leak on one of the lines. wow. being outright lied to was a new experience for me. would never recommend this place to anyone. steer clear!"
1-star,0,brought my car in to check the brakes. they gave me a quote for 300+ dollars to repair a caliper and get new brake pads. walked out with no work and went to another brake masters on ray rd. where they said the calipers were fine and pads looked great. paid 80 dollars to machine the rotors.
2-star,0,"went to brake masters today to get a simple brake fluid flush on my wife's 4runner as it had a bit of a spongy pedal. when i arrived steve greeted me and checked me in. the tech took it for a test drive to verify the concern. took my other vehicle for a car wash and came back 15 minutes later and they were already lowering it from the lift. we drove home. the pedal felt much better, but noticed a funny noise coming from the front end. when i got home i looked under the vehicle and there was brake fluid all over the wheel wells, the control arms and the inside of the tires. they also managed to get my headlight dirty. i immediately called steve to let him know and he apologized and told me to bring it in the morning so they can clean it up. not acceptable! a simple flush turned into a mess. i had to power wash the whole front end because their tech did not pay attention to detail. makes me wonder if they are capable of doing bigger jobs. i was a tech at a dealership and just took it because i was on a time crunch. you definitely get what you pay for! no thanks never again.... i also do have pictures that i took of the mess in case anyone would like to see."
3-star,0,"not sure what to think... i had my front brake serviced in glendale a few years ago (4/5?) and they have done a great job i thought so i decided to go to the chandler location to service my back drums. i went with a coupon for a $119 job brake and ended up paying $300 not sure how i got there. seems like you never get the price you would expect, a bit frustrating son 't you think? nonetheless, i spent about 4 hours on saturday morning waiting for my car then took off. everything was fine until i started to hear a clunking noise when braking. i wasn't sure what it was but couldn't bring back the car until monday morning. i went there at opening and explain what i've heard. left the car and they shuttled me to work (nice to be offered a shuttle service). later on they call me stating that in fact the noise was coming from the front rotors and they needed resurfacing. i said okay and they did it for free, nice. my coworker brings back to the store and i took my car to lunch. what a big surprise when i tried to brake... the car was still rolling! it felt like i was only using the back brakes. so i decided to go back to the shop again and told them what was going on. they ended up saying that the brake pads needed to be bedded in the resurfaced rotors and it was a matter of going and braking multiple times. as i thought it was dangerous to do so i left my car one more time there. later on they picked me up at work with my car in order to try the brakes. this time they were working however not as hard than before i brought the car to them. i said good enough though and started to think about it. my car is a honda with 165000 miles on it and the front rotor were the originals, a bit rusty and probably on their end of life. so i decided to get some new ones that i changed myself. i had to re-bed the brakes myself however now they are working like new! so basically they did an okay job however i'm still a bit concerned about their prices. i was quote $139 for brakes that you can find for $40 on amazon.com... and this doesn't include the labor, just parts! so, sure they offer a lifetime warranty, however basically bendix provides it, they are just passing it on and you still have to pay for labor. all in all, they were willing to work on my upcoming issues which was great however, price wise, they might not be that competitive. would it be nice to bring your own brakes... for more savings?"
5-star,1,"i have to say . it has always been a pleasure doing business here, however this time they went above and beyond for me. they were able to fix my car under full warranty with absolutely no issues, which included dropping off and picking me up when my vehicle was done, apparently i had a damaged compressor on my air conditioning my warranty on my compressor was for 1 year and labor was for 90 days which i had exceeded by 3 months. i walked in and asked about my warranty and sergio the manager stated "" dont worry about it, you spent money with us before now its our time to step up to you and take care of you "" wow....he took care of the compressor and the labor and i was shocked... i will tell as many people as i can to help him out.. he deserves it... thanks again sergio and i will continue to trust brake masters..."
1-star,0,"i have been going to brake masters for 12 years. my experiences have been getting worse with time. a year ago i brought my mini van in for an alignment and oil change. i was told it would be done in 2 hours. i came back after 2 hours to find it had not been even been in the shop. they technician tried to convince me to leave it for longer, but i needed my car. i left very frustrated. last fall i took my mini cooper to brake masters for new front brakes. not only did they not do a complete job, they took 2 hours longer than their estimate to replace the brakes. they were never honest with their time estimates. at one point, i asked how long and they replied, just a few more minutes, come to find out they didn't even have the pad in their shop yet. they (finally) replaced the brakes, rotors and sensors, but were unable to reset the brake warning light. i have since learned it takes 2 minutes to reset the light and i did it myself. they said the rear brakes were causing the light (they weren't, there are two separate lights one for the front, one for the rear brakes). i returned a month later to have them replace the rear brakes. they ""said"" they replaced the pads, rotors and sensor. again they were unable to reset the light. i reset the light. a month later the light came back on. i took it to the mini dealer this time and was told the sensor was not replaced. thus the light continued to come on. the dealer replaced the sensor and my brake light problem has been fixed. the paperwork clearly shows i paid for a new sensor. i am now registering a complaint with bbb and their corporate office to get my money back. i will not return."
1-star,0,"i took my car here to see if they would warranty any work from the germann and gilbert road locations. they would not do anything... these guys are just as much of a**holes as the other one. i had a manager who runs the stores in the area, take a look at my car, and he also did nothing. first off if you are a manager have some courtesy, don't yell at customers! second you should not be a manager of a car repair shop if you can't fix your own car. my review from germann and gilbert: _________________________________________________________________these people are the rudest a**holes ever. first off after charging close to $600 worth of work, then broke my car. my brake pedal was almost to the floor, and they told me it was my back brakes. they adjusted the back brakes and there was no change in pedal height. they striped 4 bolts on the ""upper oil pan"" (engine). they do not even stand behind they're work. i took my car to another mechanic and i was told it was the brake power booster. i got it replaced correctly and now my brakes work great (not thanks to these a**holes!) _________________________________________________________________"
5-star,1,"the first time i went to brakemasters in chandler on dobson and chandler boulevard, my dad suggested that i call them. i had already called a couple of other places for a quote on work i needed done asap, but since my dad was going to help out with travel, the store was near him and he usually puts a place through the paces before giving it his stamp of approval, i called. the quote i got was $80 less than any other place - without even telling them about any other quotes. they got the work done in just over an hour. my husband and i have had to take our vehicles in a few times since then, the quotes have always been good, the manager always has a ready discount or coupon to add to help out and they do what they can to make sure that you are able to get the repairs that you need, if they can add a discount, they do. they will even take you into the bay and show you exactly what needs to be repaired and why, so that you can see for yourself. they do drop offs and pick ups for longer jobs - in a manner and distance far superior to any dealerships i've used. last week, when my husband got home from work and had some whining and squeaking, they said to bring the car over ... they prepared a free estimate on the car, even though they were not able to get started until closing time - they stayed an extra hour to finish my inspection and other customers' vehicles who were already there. the kind of customer service delivered by this brakemasters is rarely found in business today; they give service like i do in my business ... with fairness, concern for the customer, and sensitivity about costs. they do business in a manner designed to generate customer loyalty and referrals for the long term, rather than gouging or trying to make as much as they can on every repair; they don't try to take advantage of the customer's need for a repair. they have earned my loyalty!"
1-star,0,"man, this place cost me a ton of money and did crappy work. the brakes they use are metal, so the crud on my wheels was nasty and the life of the brakes was fleeting. when they would fix one thing, lo and behold something else needed to be fixed. mainly my fuel pump, which caused my car to have major start issues once replaced. the fuel pump was because my gas guage suddenly stopped working after they had replaced my struts. they could never get my tires balanced. i regret the money they took from me and think about 1/2 the work they did on my car was not necessary."
4-star,1,nobody likes to hear that awful screeching from your breaks going out on the car...all i hear is money...leaving my wallet. i stopped into brake masters and the guys were all very helpful. they did a complimentary brake inspection. it turned out that my front brakes were completely worn out. i didn't have time to get them fixed that day so they gave me a printed quote and told me to come back asap. i returned two days later and they remembered me and my car right away. i dropped the car off and they called a few hours later saying it was ready. they honored the original price quote and actually gave me a discount. they never tried to sell me anything extra. thanks guys for making this a great experience.
5-star,1,"back in april i had major issues with my a/c compressor and serpentine belt. they fixed these issues at a fair market rate, according to a few references and reviews i'd read online. now on oct 19th i had the exact same problem, i dropped of on my way to work, and worried about the bil. i got my warranty through them the first time, making the trip absolutely free!! car runs great again, ice cold a/c, and the power steering is smoother than it has ever been. thanks guys!! ryan"
5-star,1,i always feel like i get great customer service and a fair price at brakemasters. i have been coming to my shop for years and have never gone through the hassles i have experienced at other places. i would highly recommend them.
5-star,1,"i have been coming to this brake master's for years and have brought various vehicles, from high end bmws to pickup trucks, classics and hybrids. i know when i come here i will always be taken care of. we usually have worked with george who has been here a long time and is an automotive wizard! i have watched him fix things that other mechanics didn't know what to do for or wanted to charge huge amounts of $$$ for in a matter of minutes at a very low cost. i always know george will take good care of us and our vehicles. again, even on high end expensive vehicles, hybrids, exotics, etc i know they will do a top notch job. anytime i have questions on work they did or something my vehicle is doing they are always happy to talk about it and problem solve it in any way they can. do not think of this place as a franchise chain ""brake masters,"" think of it as a fantastic, skilled crew of local mechanics who know their stuff and take care of their community. a+++ highly recommended."
5-star,1,"i was so blessed by the service and integrity of this location. the manager jerry was thoughtful and knowledgeable when i called and further impressed me while i was in store. i got my front brakes replaced and left the store in a timely fashion and was sure that i was taken care of. i will 100% return to this location for years to come. phenomenal service, best price and care. free wifi and good a/c in the waiting area. another gentleman (i believe the other manager) checked on me to see if i needed anything or the tv channel changed while they took my car on a test drive to confirm all was good with it. elsewhere i have paid much more and received far less quality. thank you brake masters"
5-star,1,"able to take me on a saturday ar 5:11pm so after i purchase groupon for joe's auto 43rd and union and arrive at 4:47 pm and was told ""we could do it on monday"". went to goodyear 35th and union git the same. did a yelp search and found brake masters open til 5:30 pm. called on the way and they said they can do it. got in and out (paid more than groupon) but who cares manager took great care of me car was ready and running by time he handed me receipt. and out the door i went..! great work team thank you from a uber / lyft driver lyft ref:peyton727407 uber ref:kcf9e61due"
5-star,1,i had my brakes replaced at brakemasters on bell rd in glendale. mark and titus and the entire staff treated me great. i brought it in without an appointment because of the urgency and they took care of me right away. they even stayed late to finish.
5-star,1,jerry and his team has always taking care of my vehicles for the past couple of years. their prices are always fair and and great workmanship. thank you guys so much.
2-star,0,has anyone revived a coupon though thetraveldealer.com from brake master to the plaza hotel in vegas and had difficulty getting a hold of the web-site to make the reservation. if you have any advise please reply to me.
1-star,0,"had ""soft pedal"" on '95 geo tracker, so i took it here to get the brakes checked. have heard nothing but bad things about b.m., but it was close & i had a coupon, so thought i'd give it a try. they said my coupon was no good (of course - classic bait-and-switch tactic) & quoted me $1300 (!!) to fix my brakes and broke my door. when i said ""thanks anyway"" and left, i went to open my driver's side door, and it sagged (basically dropped) a few inches. the technician that worked on it put the jack under the door instead of on the frame 4 inches away. took it to my normal go-to shop (which is much further away - why i didn't go there to begin with), which fixed the brakes for just $250 and fixed my bent door frame for free. lesson learned? if you find a good shop, stick with it regardless of any logistical problems."
5-star,1,"great guys here! i have been bringing my car here for a couple years now, and have had a great experience every time. they really go above and beyond and are very quick, even when you don't have an appointment. the only complaint i have is the bathrooms are not very clean! and there's no changing table for babies. either way, it won't stop me from coming. they have even given me a courtesy rides a couple times to make my appointments more convenient."
1-star,0,"this place is the epitome of ""bait & switch"". they quoted us $165 for an alignment, let us wait in the waiting room for close to an hour & also forfeit out appointment at another repair shop that had quoted us $265, then came back & said it would be $300, nearly double the quote. they couldn't care less about the origin l quote & wouldn't even come down to the $265 we could've paid at the other shop. they said the best they could do is $295, a whole 5 dollars. save it! there are repair shops all over. go to any one of those before wasting your time here."
3-star,0,the experience was pleasant but i took my car to my mechanic a week or two later to get my brakes replaced. they told me that i was about a quart low on oil which is disappointing. it's a hassle to go back and ask them to fill it completely.
2-star,0,"i've been going to this location for over 2 years and i love the service i always receive. however, today, the guy behind the desk was rude and condescending. he rolled his eyes at me when i answered his questions and just brushed me off. i didn't get a sticker to say how many miles i need my next oil change to and just everything was off. i'm going to be finding a new brake masters because if this is any indication of how things are going to be now on, i don't want to get scammed or treated like an idiot."
5-star,1,"went in soon after they opened in the morning. was in and out within an hour. brakes already feel and sound much better. quick, professional service, and only got repairs done on what was needed."
1-star,0,"they told me about an hour the brake service would be done. it took 3 hours and 41 minutes to finish it. the pads that they sold me were not here; they had to go pick them up. when i went to ask why they told me it would take one hour, he said that he hasn't told me that, calling me a liar. don't go somewhere they lie to you. price was above average by the way."
1-star,0,"these guys are crooks and deceiving liars. do not go here! i went in today to get a quote of brakes, they broke my window and claimed it just fell after shutting my door, then they added about ten other things to the quote, one of the things being my rear shocks leaking, and have the quote telling me it would be for the original same shocks that on our the truck, these guys do not even know their vehicles. he quoted me for the bottom of the line shock, knowing my truck comes standard with bilstein shocks. they would not listen to me when i said ""no"" put my vehicle back together and i am leaving. continued on and on with ridiculous prices. do not go here! they are scum of the scum. you can know that i will never come back."
5-star,1,"best customer service in awhile!!!!! didn't wait long at all, they were very nice and made me feel comfortable and offered tips. will visit again if needed:)"
5-star,1,"i needed an oil change and to replace spark plugs in my car on a saturday. went to a couple of other shops in the area but no one could get me in for the day. went to master brakes which is right by where i workout. i walked in and was greeted by jerry who said he'd get me in and out today even if they had 20 cars. went to the gym to kill time. jerry called and said i needed a couple more plugs and they gave me a ride to get them! even better, when i returned and waiting in the lobby, a lady had been in there for several hours and another repairman came in, acknowledged she had been waiting awhile, and offered to take her to get something to eat and offered to pay! this place definitely knows what customer service means aside from providing excellent repair services. highly recommend! i will be back!"
5-star,1,"was extremely pleased with their service! they fixed my brakes (from problems i was having from the previous techs who installed it recently) i got a new battery for a decent price. the manager was extremely nice and helpful and did an excellent job with customer service! this team was friendly, courteous, and professional. and the wait time was excellent. less than an hour!"
5-star,1,"manager was extremely courteous and professional.... he cares a lot about customer satisfaction. i would definitely recommend this location. if any part of the service is unsatisfactory, the manager will immediately make it right."
2-star,0,ok so ernie is great with customer service. joe on the other hand is rude condescending and complains too much. this was my first visit to a brake masters and was pretty pleased in the beginning. ernie left early for the day and that's when my 5 star review plummeted to a 2. i'm not sure if i'll return to this location. if ernie isn't there then i won't come point blank period.
5-star,1,"we came back to this one after our other guy left a different location. tony the manager took great care of us! we took car for oil change two weeks ago and today was called after lunch and ask could they get me in for an oil change. tony said come on down. when i got there i explained i was overdue for an oil change and filter but i also needed belts checked as one has been squealing on and off. i also asked for brakes to be checked. they got me in right away and finished in a timely manner. he said the belt was dry but not cracked so not necessary to change yet and brakes have 70% left on front and 50% left in back so we're good there as well. i've been going to brakes masters for years and years because of their honesty. i appreciate them and their work. btw, they are acceptingb he school book fundraiser coupons now at this location if your coupon says rock springs. tony explained that the ownership changed hands to corporate after those coupons came out so they weren't accepting them as they were not getting credit for them. tony went to bat for the customers and now they are accepting them which is great! discounts are always great!"
5-star,1,"we had a great experience here getting an oil change. i live close by and always passed by this place thinking they only do brakes, but apparently they do everything but tires. tony was very nice and attentive, definitively sign up for their email coupons! we've been going across the street to firestone but repeatedly get screwed. i will be coming here from now on!"
1-star,0,i took my vehicle to brake masters for an alignment. while they were doing the alignment they told me i needed new shocks etc. and quoted me a price of over 1400.00. i routinely have my tires rotated every 3000 miles and no one had mentioned this previously so i decided to get a second/third opinion. i took my vehicle to two other shops to get estimates and opinions and both of the shops told me that there was absolutely nothing wrong with my shocks etc. if i could give this place a zero rating i would because of their deceitfulness. i plan on writing a letter to corporate and letting them know that one of their shops outright lied to me! my recommendation is if this place tells you you need any work get another opinion! i will never return to a brake masters again!
5-star,1,i am a happy customer today. steve is very honest and knowledgeable. tony is the same. i definitely will recommend this place. the other one in s eastern is questionable.
1-star,0,"took my car this morning for a oil change. and had a coupon that we get from a school coupon book from my niece. it's the third year we get this book and used that same coupon and this same location. and the grumpy old man didn't want to take it he said it was fraud and that they never take them! lies i called my dad and uncle and he they both confirm that they do take them. the grumpy dude just didn't want to take it. so i said fine just do the oil change because i need it. he then tried to get me to sign up for something to get 10$ off but fail to tell me it was for a credit card. i read the paper right before i signed and ripped it up lol it took longer than he said for the oil change. i paid and then gave me a list of bullshit that is wrong with my car that i know for a fact are lies, because everything is brand new. they don't care about their customers. he was rude and didn't care. no one in the family is going back to them."
5-star,1,"came in this morning for brake service, not knowing if i needed front or rear brake pads... got an inspection done... low & behold, i needed both, plus front rotors immediately start thinking about price & it being above my price range...but god bless steve the manager!!! worked out a great price for me & was very understanding & compassionate!! if u need brake service and let me point out it comes with a warranty...head on down to brake masters!!! thank u again steve and the technicians at brake masters!!"
1-star,0,"i had my brakes done here a few years ago and was not impressed. they tried what is probably the normal caliper upsell for like 4 bills more which i declined (calipers are less than 1/2 that). i am driving months later on the old ones and no problems yet. the service was for the 4 wheels, 2 disc's and 2 drum's. based on the squeaking they never touched the drums beyond blowing them out with air. $300 for some disc brake work i assume. not a year later i replaced the pads upfront myself. i would not go there again. vegas is notoriously bad for car repair and this place is one of the reasons."
1-star,0,"spent 799 on brake job. you expect a thorough job to be done because it is a safety issue. 1 hour to do a brake check. authorized them to do the work. received bill and they billed me for lifetime brakes. what that was i don't know but was billed for that. got in truck parking brake not depressed and radio needed to be reset. got home parking brake pedal went to the floor no resistance had to push it down three times to get it to resist. parking brake realease lever would not return light stayed on i returned it right away. they told me return spring is faulty and it just so happened went out when you took it home mechanic who worked on it arrogant and started to argue with me i asked him about the resetting of the radio and he told me the battery went dead. shady things going on here but was told they would fix it. never heard from them for five days called and was told the owner will not pay for the fix. says, ""it is just one of those things."" now i have to take the truck to a reputable dealer who can tell me if my brakes are safe. first if mechanic that sensitive should not talk to the customer the most unprofessional service i have ever received second do not say you will do something then go back on it. again, a horrible business decision i have the voice mails that said they would fix it 799 for a brake job have them attest to everything working properly before taking keys and have them put it in writing. as i see it parking brake was not depressed when i got in truck which leads any normal person to say they did not verify it worked properly. you got my money and hope this review helps others make an informed decision. mechanics there should not be trusted based on the treatment of customers. owner should not be trusted for work done"
5-star,1,"i am in the middle of a huge hassle having to get my brakes done, water pump replaced, and fuel pump replaced. *sigh* let's just say that i haven't had an easy last few days trying to get this all taken care of! but ernie was very friendly and didn't mind explaining everything to me, as i'm shaking up a bottle of formula for my crying 3 month old. ha! he has a great sense of humor and helped put me at ease while dealing with pesky warranty companies and dealerships. the water pump and brakes were both done here, and i haven't heard a squeak or seen a drop of fluid leak since we left. i am very happy with the repairs done, the price paid, and the quality of customer service that i received. the location was very convenient for me as well. will definitely recommend to others."
5-star,1,just got my oil changed here and i have to say this definitely where i'll be taking my car from now on. ernie is a genuine guy and really makes you understand what's going on with your car and why you're doing what. definitely know i'm getting honest people working on my car here.
2-star,0,"$375 to replace rear pads & rotors. labor rate at $88 is good. pads at $91.95, roughly a 25% markup there. rotors at $160 (for two), an even larger markup (unless sports quality rotors were used - which doesn't make a lot of sense considering it's a buick sedan). no issues with quality of work, but howie's auto offers the same (or better) quality and doesn't mark-up the parts as much as these guys. only way i'd come back here is if i order my own parts from amazon and bring them with me (which means they won't warranty the parts, but that's standard). unfortunately ernie wasn't in the shop today, so i had to deal with david. based on my experience today vs what i've read here, avoid david and deal with ernie."
5-star,1,ernie is the most honest mechanic i have ever had contact with! this shop is amazing and a rare find in las vegas!! will definitely recommend them to friends! thanks ernie- u guys are the best!!! see u next time for sure!
5-star,1,"was looking for a place to change the oil and rotate my tires. got a chance to talk to a customer who had been coming to this group of stores, with the same owner, for 18 years. the rock springs location is their newest, opened in 2013. i was so impressed with ernie, the guy running the counter, that i brought my car back to replace a sensor a week later. it's really nice to find an honest shop with fair prices."
5-star,1,"looking for an honest qualified mechanic stop by here and see ernie. he is a straight shooter. i had my brakes done this past weekend and very happy with the speed, quality and cost of service."
5-star,1,"it's one thing to read rave reviews about a business or someone. but it definitely is another thing to experience it first hand! today i got to experience how great ernie truly is. the yelpers before me have mentioned it before and i'll mention it again. ernie and his team are one honest team of professionals. when i visited with him yesterday after reading the reviews here, he recommended that he took a look at what i needed for my car so he asked me to return early today so he could get me in the shop. he gave me best and worst case scenarios yesterday and today, after he got a look, he and his team got me in the best case scenario and save me hundreds of dollars! his business principle of doing the right thing and just being plain honest will continue to give him this kind of success. i am telling people i know to consider him when needing brake service or any service for that matter. thanks, ernie. i wish you continued success, and your professionalism and honesty will take you very far in your personal and professional life. thank you so much!"
5-star,1,"add me to the list of fans. ernie and his mechanic checked out my brakes, fixed a minor issue the previous mechanic had messed up, and refused payment. ""come see me in six months."" how awesome is that? i will be back when i do need brake work!"
5-star,1,just had break job and oil change and it was done quickly and professionally. very impressed with the overall experience and i will refer all of my friends and coworkers to these guys from now on. thanks again to all at brake masters.
5-star,1,like previous reviewers said ernie and his team are amazing and totally honest about what is and is not needed. have to say that going across the street and getting a ridiculous estimate has me forever returning here. it's great to see true honest mechanics in vegas and with them doing everything but tires and exhaust it's a great shop for your needs.
5-star,1,"honest, fast and friendly. i'm so glad i found this place. i originally went there on a recommendation from discount tires down the road and was very satisfied."
4-star,1,"literally in and out of this shop in 20 minutes. just needed an oil change and told my friend to pick me up so we can have breakfast while it got done. but by that time, i was already being handed my keys! sure a big part of it was probably because there were only 3 customers there at the time but saved time for myself and wasted my friends gas. so i win twice. they also did a quick check on my car which is their standard procedure and recommended more than forced me for some upgrades. shout outs to livingsocial.cm for the great coupon."
1-star,0,"when things go well, it's a fine business. when things don't go well, it's terrible. when car rental employees are not proactive when cars are not available at time of the reservation pickup, it ruins the day. had these people made some calls to the upcoming few reservations, we could have made alternate plans."
1-star,0,"i called to book a moving truck to move, two weekends prior to the date. when i called 5 days in advance to confirm i discovered i had been booked in for a cargo van which would not accommodate the amount of stuff i was moving. i was very disappointed and the new budget staff member i was speaking to apologized but did not offer any help. now i am scrambling to find a moving truck while every other company is sold out. not impressed and will never use budget again."
1-star,0,"be careful renting from this location. the car we got had bed bugs!!! after a 5 hour drive in the rental car, i was covered in bed bug bites - classic breakfast, lunch, and dinner bites along the seat belt lines. budget was not willing to reimburse us after paying $600 on bed bug dogs to ensure that we didn't track any bugs into our house or our family's house. luckily we were bed bug free, confirming that bed bugs were from the car. after speaking with the rep from this location and the avis budget regional manager, the company was not responsive or willing to do their part in damage control. be very careful!"
1-star,0,"for those of us who live near this business and have to listen to continual horns honking up to 25 times in a row, and loud music at 2:45 am by the jerks delivering cars, they should lose their business license. multiple complaints to city hall have had zero effect. this is an oklahoma company by the way. anyone considering renting from this outfit should see how they treat the vehicles upon return. i'm talking standing burnouts, with employees standing around laughing their heads off as gravel and stones and dust are sprayed all over the other cars and apartment next door. spinning tires and pulling donuts in the lot spraying all the other cars with gravel. we watched last year as one of the guys backed a black jeep into a large truck, damaging both vehicles and was laughing about it. make sure you check your rental before your take it out and record it on your phone. transmission problems from burnouts and paint chips are not your friends. i would never rent anything from a company who disregards the neighbourhood in which they operate. or treats their own vehicles like this."
1-star,0,"expect to pay $15-$20 extra at counter on top of the price you're quoted when you reserve the car. i have rented from here dozens of times in past couple years. have noticed in the past year that they never have the model i reserved available. but they are always fast to offer to rent me a bigger model right away, as long as i pay more $$$. if you dont pay extra, they either offer you a smaller car than the one you reserved (they will tell you the smaller car is actually nicer! really!) if you dont go for the smaller car, you sit and wait until someone returns a car in the class you want. it's a smart money-making move that takes advantage of customers. from what i've observed (while waiting 30-60 min for car on multiple occasions), most customers just want to get out of there fast and are willing to pay extra (""it's only 6 dollars per day"") to get a car at the time they reserved. bottom line: if the rental company cant provide you the car type you reserved at the time they promised for the price they promised, the customer should not pay more. they should upgrade you for free to a car that is at least as big as the one you reserved. it's that simple. the customer should not pay extra because the company cant hold up its end of the bargain."
1-star,0,i was charged $322 by budget for an 8 hour rental on a saturday. budget did not have after hours return and we were apparently charged for sunday when their offices were closed. they refused to review and adjust the bill. avoid budget at all costs. car arranged through park hyatt hotel in toronto.
5-star,1,"i just returned my car, so hopefully i won't be seeing any of those mystery charges other people have complained about. i've rented from this location on multiple occasions, and it's always gone well, but yesterday's rental was the best. u-haul changed my reservation for a moving van, and i called this location in a panic, hoping to score a van. the staff were friendly and immediately reserved a 12-foot cargo van for me at reasonable time. when i arrived to pick it up, there were several visibly stressed out people who were obviously also moving on dec 1. the staff were extremely calm, helpful, and professional, even though they were dealing with a room full of people who were on edge. although their vans are more expensive than u-haul's, the service is so much better, friendlier, and straightforward. i recommend them for anyone who has problems with u-haul."
1-star,0,been renting from enterprise with great service and very competitive price. very happy with enterprise over the last 10 years. this is my 1st time to rent at budget rent a car- emergency reason and no other car rentals available (11/26-28). poor service-(budget rent a car-toronto.canada- nely) 1) they will not bring the car to you nor will they do a visual inspection w you at pick-up. 2) upon return - they require you to gas-up the car within 2 miles of the drop-off and show receipt upon return of car.(never have had this requirement). why.??.... isnt it enough that you return the car with full-tank of gas and in the same shape. 3) why even ask if you wanted a different car during pick-up if there is non- available at the time to offer ??? will never rent at budget again if i can help it... maybe this okay to some but certainly not to me.
2-star,0,"just tried to book a van online. get this--the booking form won't actually tell you how many people/bags can fit in any of their vehicles! useful, right?!? i tried the online chat function and was told ""since you're in canada we don't have that information."" they actually could not tell me a fundamentally important detail about one of their own vehicles. unbelievable. i would have to call them and navigate my way through their phone system just to get this one basic piece of information. forget that. so much for the internet making anything easier!"
2-star,0,"i've left this place with mixed feelings. folks at the counter were friendly and helpful. however, they gave me a truck with the tank... let's say ""not quite filled up"". which cost me additional $10-15 or so, because i returned it with the actually full tank - noticing that the fuel indicator does not under-read, as i initially thought. no attempt was made to compensate for that or at least apologize. happens, but do check your fuel level before leaving - don't repeat my error! also, when i was returning the truck, manoeuvring area was blocked by a bunch of cars and it took me certain running around under freezing rain and asking for help before the truck finally made it to its parking spot. as a final tiny bit - the truck was full of garbage, had to throw it away. not fun, really. otherwise an okayish' location, partially saved by the positive attitude of the people working there. being polite and helpful must be appreciated."
1-star,0,"this note is directed to management of this location:::i have a huge issue with your company - and specifically this location: why would your site let you book a car 1min before the location closes? absolutely unacceptable - i pre-paid for a car at 333 college st. tor on canada and the site accepted a booking for 3:59pm.. found myself 5mins late and the csr refused to keep the location open to accommodate me (for 5mins longer). i ended up taking a cap to the airport to see if there was anything i could do to get a car from the only location that was open in toronto... the csr rep there also told me that he wouldn't do anything to help... this is absurd... this was a huge opportunity for your employee to right a wrong (the wrong being your site letting me book so close to a close time) instead they simply amplified the lack of customer service your company provides. i am a loyal thrifty car renter (at least 3times a month - every month) and decided to give your company a shot, which proved to be a huge mistake. not to pull a ""poor me"" card here, but the urgency of this rental was to visit a friend who was diagnosed with a terminal blood cancer and is going into an emergency surgery this week. this visit could be the last time i see him again. when i tried to ask your csr rep at 333 college street to empathize with my situation he decided to respond by saying ""you need the car, but i live in st. catherine's and it's far away for me to get home""... as if his commute was more important than someone's life... absolutely blown away! i documented the employee's name and can let you know who he is (off line) look forward to hearing back from you.. i've also tweeted my concerns, posted to your facebook page and will continue telling this story until i'm compensated for my rental and your site is updated to only allow rentals u to 30mins before the location closes..."
1-star,0,"two things that i can't stand are hidden fees and power-trippers. at this budget location, you get both. i just moved to the neighbourhood and was very happy that this location was so close to my place. i've rented there before and the staff had been friendly and the price was right. a lot has changed since then. the pick-up was smooth and weekend staff were reasonable. my cargo van was messy when i picked it up -- not a problem for me, it's a cargo van and i expect a bit of a mess. the one day price seemed good $80 / day but that quote didn't include the required commercial insurance (+ $30, fair enough). however, when i returned, the weekday staff demanded to see my gas receipt. apparently you have to supply one, though i've never been asked for one before. so, i got charged a service charge -- not because the tank wasn't full (they didn't dispute this) -- but due to lack of a receipt. when i pointed out that this receipt requirement wasn't explained to me when i picked up the van, the service guy (barry) called me a liar. it's also nowhere on the contract (though it might be in the small font folder that holds your contract). barry also demanded that i clean up the cargo van. although i was initially happy to comply (i added a bit to the existing mess), i wasn't going to stick around after his insult. oh, and did i mention the $5 parking charge?! so, $170 total for an $80 quote on the rental. plus, a bit of abuse from barry (free of charge). if this doesn't sound like the type of experience you want here's some other car rental places in the area: http://www.wheels4rent.ca/ -- on nassau, has trucks but closed sundays enterprise car rental at bay and gerrard (on bay, south of gerrard) -- haven't tried this one hertz car rental at bay and gerrard (on gerrard, north side, east of bay). -- i've had good experiences here."
4-star,1,"even though i walk by this stretch of college street all the time, i barely knew this place existed. that's probably because it's been a coon's age since i needed to carry anything larger than a body (not that i'm hauling bodies all the time, but that's a reasonable analogy mass-wise of the largest payload i've transported in the past couple of -- hey, why are you looking at me like that?). anywho. i needed a rental for an out-of-town trip. there is a certain threshold of time and distance where hourly rental services like zipcar and autoshare become prohibitive. spending the afternoon in ancaster is one such vector. i showed up on sunday morning at 9:00am a few minutes after they opened. it was busy with people returning vehicles, so i waited dutifully in line and listened to ez rock. after a 15 minute wait, i made it to the counter, plopped down my driver's licence and a credit card and i was good to go. another five minute wait after that (it had snowed the night before and they had to clean the car) i got my wheels. a white(!) hyundai elantra with only 1,800 clicks on it. because this is a newish location, i think most of the cars were as new or newer than the one i took out. i can't really describe the vehicle or my drive. what do you think this is: car and driver? my only issue with this budget is that it's not set up to take cars back outside of business hours. this meant a bit of a rush to get back before 5:00pm, but the return was quite painless. the cars are clean and it was $50 for the day's rental (waiving all supplemental insurance). i'd recommend it. obligatory title pun: could god create a car so big he couldn't budge it? menu readability: not too applicable, is it boyo? need to mention: this location offers a free pick up service. what this place teaches me about myself: i hate white cars. they should be banned."
5-star,1,i've gone to these guys ever since i moved to arizona. i wouldn't take my car anywhere else. friendly and trustworthy folks that will take care of you. kyle and matt do great work.
5-star,1,"the best place to take your car for honest, fast car repairs. they tell you what's wrong, what needs to be fixed and what does not. my wife took her car in for an oil change and her daytime running light was out. c & r found a loose bulb, put it back in place and didn't charge a thing for it. and they got it all complete while she was at her workout at trufitness."
5-star,1,got an alignment on my 2008 lexus after getting new tires. i couldn't believe the difference. the handling had gotten gradually out of alignment. i wasn't sure if poor alignment was the problem actually. so i explained what the handling was doing and they took care of it. so smooth now. thank you guys for the excellent service!
5-star,1,"i had a great experience at the anthem location. i had some problems driving home to flagstaff, az from texas and the towing company suggested c & r. i dropped my car off there on a friday afternoon and ended up having to wait in their lobby about 5 hours for someone to come and get me as i'm not from the phoenix area, and the entire staff was so friendly to me and almost made it fun to hang out there. my car was ready monday morning and they called me right when they said they would. once i arrived, they showed me exactly what happened with my car and what they did to replace it, which was awesome considering my knowledge of cars leaves something to be desired. two days after i picked it up, i received a follow up text from the manager to see how everything was going. the extra mile goes a long way! every time my car needs work i will absolutely make the drive down to anthem to have them do it."
5-star,1,"kyle and his team are simply outstanding, trustworthy and provide the best customer service and quality repairs/maintenance and workmanship at a reasonable price better than any shop i've ever been to! i hope you all enjoyed your donuts in much appreciation for everything!"
5-star,1,i've always had a good experience at c & r tire. they seem genuinely concerned about making their customers happy and satisfied. they were really busy the last time i just walked in to see about an oil change appointment. i was happy to come back another day but they worked me right in. i appreciate the customer service!!
5-star,1,"thank you guys for being awesome! we thought we had a reliable car shop down the street from, but come to find out this shop beats them! this will now be our home shop while we are here in arizona."
5-star,1,"long story short! traveling back home to california, car breaks down. these guys went above and beyond trying to figure out what was going on with my ride. i cannot say enough about how friendly and helpful they all are. josh was my contact there and he even gave my gf and i a ride to and from the hotel around the corner from them. if you need any work done on your car or maybe you just need tires, i highly recommend, no actually, i insist that you give them a call! if i didn't live so far i would totally go to them without a doubt! thank you, thank you, thank you for everything guys!"
5-star,1,"this my go to auto shop in anthem! lonnie and crew are professional, honest, and trustworthy! thank you for all you do!!!"
5-star,1,"my experience at c & r in anthem was absolutely fantastic. we were visiting from northern california and had a problem with the cooling system in our kia sedona. the staff at c & r were knowledgeable and thorough. they solved my issue and for us on the road again. when we are in anthem, this will be the only place i take our cars. thanks."
1-star,0,i used to get pretty good service here but won't be coming back after today. i've been coming here for years and have spent a lot of money bringing in different vehicles - personal cars and company cars. the man up front is incredibly rude and condescending. not worth it since there are plenty of other great options in town.
5-star,1,"nice to find a tire place that doesn't rip you off. i blew a tire on my trailer and really could have got raped but the crew here hooked me up with a great tire for less than a cheap chinese one i'd gotten elsewhere. if i lived close, this would be my tire shop!"
5-star,1,"i was happy to find a c&r auto in anthem as they're known for having very capable mechanics. they performed a scheduled maintenance on my prius. i dropped the car off, giving them permission to perform whatever it needed. the work was done within the hour, and they didn't suggest any unnecessary work (oil and air filter only). the shop was new and clean, the staff friendly and helpful, and the work was high quality and extremely reasonable. living in anthem, i put a lot of miles on my car and very much rely on it. it's awesome to find an extremely competent shop that's also honest and reasonably priced."
5-star,1,"i went in for front brake rotors and pads replacement and extremely copacetic. i was referred to this place by my lady because she had a very positive experience. the persons who took care of me was mike and luke. they were honest, which is something you don't find in a lot of the auto shops if you're mechanically ignorant, but they'll tell it like it without the extra bs services that you don't need. since luke did an excellent job on my car, i will be bringing it back to get my back brake rotors and pads replaced. the fact that they gave me a reasonable price, if not the best i've seen for this type of service, they just bought a loyal customer. so if you ever need automotive or tire services, come prepared with your questions and car symptoms. these guys will tell you like it is, save you an extra few bucks, and not leave you running around in circles. hope this review will help those who cringe going to an auto shop due to their shady services, but i trust this place because of their reviews, my first time experience, and a+ bbb rating."
5-star,1,were on our way to flagstaff from mesa when our car started misfiring. was a great experience with feeling stuck with two kids on our trip. they got us in and fixed within the hour. guys were super friendly and nice and informative. glad i found them on here!
5-star,1,"dealing with honesty and integrity is a blessing, but this entire crew is also knowledgeable and friendly.. we've gotten to know all of the service techs as well as the mechanics who service our vehicles by name. lonnie and mike are excellent and super friendly service advisors while luke,matt and mason are the reliable mechanics that actually service all of our vehicles .. kudos to a staff that works well together and are always there for their customers ."
5-star,1,taking our vehicles to this establishment is a comfort and joy knowing the job will be performed correctly. the honesty and integrity of their entire staff is a blessing.
5-star,1,"take your car here and then take it easy because you'll be in good hands. these guys are honest, reasonably priced, skilled, and great to work with!"
5-star,1,"very happy with my service here! kyle and matt make a great team! had my ball joints replaced at a nearby competitor and they failed after only 30,000 miles. original ones lasted 130,000. c&r determined that the parts used were not top quality parts. the quote to fix everything at c&r was slightly lower than the ""we're sorry"" quote at the other shop. my son had some work done here also and some details were left undone. they quickly corrected the problem and offered him 4 free oil changes for his trouble."
5-star,1,"c & r tire, (anthem), are standup guys, my oil change went over the time estimate by about 20 minutes, because the tech doing the oil change slipped and cut himself bad enough to need stitches. he finished the oil change before going for medical help. c & r then reduced the bill because of the delay down to $12.43. you can't go wrong with these guys."
5-star,1,i went to c&r tire after initially going to 2 different businesses to get my tires balanced and rotated and an oil change only to be told they were booked. once i went to c&r tire they immediately took my truck in and went to work. great experience and all the staff were professional and very courteous. the waiting area is clean and has coffee and water available with a tv. the work was done quickly and proficiently at a reasonable price. i would refer my friends and family to them and i will be back.
5-star,1,"the staff at c & r are super friendly, helpful and knowledgeable. the store manager, lonnie, is fantastic! i had two brand new tires i needed on my jeep and they had them there the next morning and were finished installing them in 45 minutes. they made me feel very comfortable and assured that i was in the right place. i would recommend them to anyone!"
5-star,1,"this has to be one of the most honest mechanic shops i've ever dealt with. i am grateful for their assistance and integrity. what could have been a huge, costly delay was avoided due to their quick diagnosis and repair. i was able to finish my journey from texas to california after they fixed my car and got me back on the road. thanks!!"
5-star,1,couldn't have been a better experience. i will and have recommended this location to many friends and family. tom was especially helpful and made what would be a negative experience so much better. i went to him for a second opinion and got much more done for significantly less! the other shop was trying to take advantage of me and it might have worked had it not been for meeting with tom. he even checked my spare which was flat and i had no idea. one month later i had to use that spare on the side of the highway and was on my way in 20 minutes as opposed to hours waiting for aaa as i was in the middle of nowhere. what a life saver!!!
5-star,1,"i really can't say enough about these guys, as you can see by my 2nd review. we bought and additional car for cash that needed a little maintenance, and my own car needed a tune up. both times dexter mentioned there were a few minor additional repairs they could use, but that neither one of them were that important to do right now. i have never ever had a repair shop not try and push as many repairs at once. they are honest and personable and we are loyal customers"
5-star,1,"these guys are great to work with, talk with dexter, he works to understand your situation and always has good recommendations i have been taking all my cars to them for several years now, never a complaint support your local guys! matt l"
5-star,1,i have been using c&r tire for all my cars - 6 - for many years. i usually go to the tatum & bell location. ralph and his team are very professional and have always done exceptional work at a very fair price. i highly recommend them!
5-star,1,"i called c&r tire to get information and they were very helpful and nice. they were extremely honest and straight forward. when i walked in every single employee acknowledged me and were friendly. the issue ended up being very small so they fixed it for free (i payed for diagnostics). i also needed new tires, so he gave me a very reasonable price and several different options. they also fixed a broken tail light for free. overall they were nice, honest, straight forward, and fixed my car for way less than i thought they would. i will most definitely be using them in the future for all my car repair/tire needs."
5-star,1,"i went in with a brake issue and it was fixed for a reasonable fee. they looked at everything else, told me what else needed fixing and gave me estimates for it all. then they just did what i wanted. no pressure or guilt trips. that's what i want from a mechanic!"
5-star,1,"i am a part time resident in anthem. we have been looking for a local auto service company that we can trust. today i had the oil changed on my acura. unlike other service stations i have worked with, they provide the oil service to manufacturer spec, e.g. acura reocommends 5-20w oil. they also inspect fluid levels, tire tread/wear, battery performance, shocks, plus other checks as a part of the service. after the service, they sat down with me to go over the findindgs. i liked the fact they were not pressuring me in any way to have the findings correct; they just factually reviewed the results. i feel i can trust them. another reason why i feel this way, c&r said the tires were ok based on the tire measurements. another tire company, earlier in the day, had also measured the tires and said that the tread on two of the tires was low and needed to be replaced. c&r said the tires have another 5-10k miles left. another thing i like is they have a master tech that has been trained on acuras. this tech can do most of what the acura dealers. lastly, i like the fact they are aaa approved. not many auto repair places have that approval because the process of getting approved is very rigorous and they do need to respond to and correct/resolve, as applicable, issues that customers raise as a part of keepng aaa aproval. based on this experience they are now my anthem auto service provider of choice for my car."
1-star,0,"i wouldn't buy anything from camping world if i were you. i encourage you to get internet quotes from several places for the rv you want. do not talk to an ignorant salesman... and do not go in person until you have struck a deal. generally speaking, all salesman are liars who have little to no product knowledge. so go check out the rvs without a salesman present, take pictures, and try everything out. look at other people's reviews, and use the various internet quotes to get the price down on the rv you want."
1-star,0,we bought a brand new trailer with a flooring defect from here that was to be replaced. they called us and said the floor was in and to drop it off. they took our trailer for 2 weeks and called to have us pick up. when we went to pick it up we discovered that they never touched or replaced anything on the trailer and did not even have the flooring in. this place is 45 minutes from our house. we made two trips down there only to discover they did nothing and lied for two weeks that the floor was done and that we needed to wait to pick up due to the smell of the floor glue. i'm not sure whom they gave our floor too but they didn't offer any type of compensation for our time or the inconvenience. the sales experience was as awful (bought in march 2018) and the customer service is non existent. i am horrified at how we have been treated and strongly urge you to purchase somewhere else. you can't trust them.
1-star,0,"i purchased a brand new trailer form here in december. while purchasing the trailer everyone was my best friend and was offering to help with what ever i needed. i took it out dry camping for the first time in january and the ignition on the refrigerator was bad so the fridge wouldn't run on gas. upon bringing it in for the warranty repair i met brad. by his demeanor if it was as if i was inconveniencing him by bringing in the trailer. brad has zero customer service skills. i came in later to try to figure out why i didn't have a part that was supposed to come with trailer when i picked it up. he called the keystone rep and the rep confirmed that the trailer should have come with the part. brad then sent me to someone else who ""would take care of it"" only for that person to tell me they couldn't do anything and to talk to brad. what a joke of customer service at this dealer. you're real important until that check clears and then they couldn't care less!!!!"
1-star,0,"wish i could give zero stars!!! the service is horrible! my husband and i are planning to purchase a travel trailer but have no idea where to begin....length? how many people does it sleep? what are the different features? the guy that was showing us the various trailers was super rude. he rushed through the information as if we were keeping him from something else! i believe he thought we weren't real customers.... by the time we got to the 3rd trailer to look at it i was done and ready to leave! i think his name was troy but whatever the case, he was a total a**hole! i refuse to come back! kick rocks!"
5-star,1,"we have nothing but great things to say about camping world. we just purchased our second trailer from them. john and mike in sales are both knowledgeable and easy to work with. never once did we feel pressured into a sale. both were more than willing to go above and beyond helping us purchase the right rv even making sure we had the correct tow vehicle and equipment so we were safe. joe, hector and oscar in the service department have always been fantastic to work with. sometimes even giving us tips to fix issues ourselves to prevent a trip to the shop. joe in finance was also great to work with. taking his time to explain all our options and add ons and not getting frustrated if we turned one down or asked a million questions. if you are in the market for an rv or need any service done on yours, you will not be disappointed in camping world."
5-star,1,bought our second tt at camping world over the weekend and we were blown away at how courteous and friendly the staff were. our salesman tj was awesome and made us feel comfortable right from the get go. we traded in our very first tt for a brand new model and we could not be happier. will definitely go back to this location.
1-star,0,"we bought a used class c that needed a few things fixed some were under good sam warranty. the ladder had broke, the step pin broke,and the awning but according to camping world nothing was covered or maybe it was just our service writer kevin who from the start was very condescending about us even buying the rv and that we were even stating off . also needed a gasket for the toilet camping world was charging 340$ you could buy a new toilet 300$ which includes installation. we ended up taking the rv out of there and will have the work done by someone else. most of the reviews here are correct i wish i would have paid attention"
1-star,0,another bad experience at camping world below standard customer service as god is my witness don't think of purchasing anything you will be very sorry
1-star,0,"absolutely the worst customer service. went to buy a trailer. budgeted $30000 on a new one, but service so crappy, decided to purchase used from private party instead."
1-star,0,"big zero for the repair department!! we have an alpine just a couple years old and the roof peeled back a year ago. they replaced the entire roof charging more than they quoted and taking longer than they quoted. the caulking looked like crap... embarrassing to pull it around but we let it go because we figured if thats what it takes to keep the roof on... guess we put up with it. well... 10 months later the roof peeled again. repair department integrity does not exist. they quote you repair time and price and something always ""happens"". try the boulder camping world or someplace else....save yourselves from the stress and disappointment!"
1-star,0,i would like to know what happened to all the horrible reviews this company has received on yelp. they are all gone including mine. the latest of my camping world saga is that my dash air went hot again for the 5th time in three years. yes camping world did the repairs every time.this time i had it repaired in two days some where else and it blows colder than ever did when i got it back from camping world. never gain will i go there and i don't know why they are so busy with all the bad reviews.
5-star,1,"we've had several warranty repairs done here and mike hulsey was so easy and great to work with. i can't imagine the stress his job carries!! he has so many people that want their units fixed immediately, and like others, our rv is our home which adds to the pressure to do it perfectly. warranty work is never quick or easy. pictures have to be taken with paperwork to fill out to send to the factory. they have to approve the work before camping world can even touch the repair that needs to happen. so getting upset about length of repair time is silly unless there is an extreme amount of time taken. really anything less than 2 months is reasonable. that was a hard fact to learn with our first rv. but it always got fixed and mike is friendly and knowledgeable. he kept us in the loop on repair status. we recently had a towbar and baseplate installed and we are excited to hit the road and test it out. thanks mike!"
5-star,1,"my wife and i recently bought a preowned 22'premier ultralight travel trailer. our salesman robert dustin was great. he greeted us asking if we had questions. he took his time and there was no pressure whatsoever. we closed the deal. jeremy in finance was a pleasure to deal with as well. can't forget kay at the front desk. very nice lady. what follows is why i gave a 5 star rating. we had dropped off our vehicle to have the hitch and wiring installed. when we arrived nothing was done and i was upset. lori (very pleasant lady) asked she could do to assist and i explained the issue. she looked into this and said someone would come to explain what transpired. the service manger mike stated that our vehicle was not rated to tow the trailer. this was very disturbing as robert and i both confirmed that it was. the service team started to dig into this further. after about 20 minutes they discovered that had incorrect information. well now it was too late for anything to get completed for install. understood we are several miles from the dealership so it was frustrating. on the way home being disappointed i received a call from the sales manager called and he stated he was aware of the issue and asked if he could talk this over with his gm jesse jensen and get back to us. the next morning mike called me taking ownership and apologized. i thanked him and we worked through the inconvenience. i stopped by the next morning to do the walk through and was greeted by robert. he apologized as well and expressed what camping world was doing to make this right. the walk through with jesse from service was great (a real nice guy). i also have to mention josh. although he was not our salesman,he took the time to assist with the audio system in our trailer. i then met with the gm jesse and he was apologetic and asked if everything was satisfactory. i said it was and that he and camping world should be proud of the staff that they had working for them. if we ever decide to purchase another rv, camping world will be our first stop. joe glazier"
1-star,0,we stopped to get help with a safety problem using our trailer towing system. we also thought we would get propane while we were getting help. after waiting for 20 minutes no one offered to try again to find us help. too busy to dispense propane. too busy to help a traveler with a safety issue. a very disappointing experience at camping world.
5-star,1,we love our new rv. everyone was wonderful and helpful! the promptly help with any concerns with your vehicle and we were very happy!
5-star,1,"update 2: we brought our class a in to get a tow package for the smart car. everything went smoothly until the roadmaster celanoid failed. twice. luckily the techs discovered it before we left the parking lot. john-john, oscar and denny refused to give up. finally a good celanoid was delivered and everything works great. these guys went above and beyond for us. they spent hours showing us how to connect and disconnect the system. they went on a drive with us to show us how it works. these are awesome people! no complaints at all with the service department! kudos to mike for having a great team. update: since purchasing our new motor coach, we experienced several factory deficiencies in some areas. we were told by other owners, it doesn't matter if you spend $80g or $500 g, there will be kinks to work out. we had the toilet or some part of it break, three times, the dinette conversion bed was not properly constructed making sleeping on it dangerous and the whole entry door was crooked. all of these issues have been handled each time efficiently and professionally by the camping world service department. while they don't like seeing us so often, we have come to know several employees by name and have a good relationship with them. the service manager mike is awesome and makes every effort to get things done in a timely fashion. john miller, pdi, knows so much as he used to work at the thor factory and john, one of the technicians is extremely knowledgeable. we don't enjoy having to keep taking the thing back but it's so nice to be greeted warmly by our salesman, tj and the other staff. my husband believes people in the service industry should be tipped whenever allowed and these folks are no different. a few bucks and a sincere thank you go a long way. we are looking forward to many road trips and adventures in our rv."

1-star,0,"i didn't think our experience with camping world service (cws) could get any worse after purchasing the rig from cw in boise. why boise? the rig was $16,000 cheaper than the ""best"" offer in vegas. we had 3 minor repairs that were covered under warranty after bringing the rig (2016 montana high country) home. we had to wait 3 weeks to get an appointment. it took another 2 weeks to get a phone call saying they finally saw the coach and would let us know what was needed. why the hell did i have a freakin apppointment for it to sit there for 2 weeks!!! then a few days later a phone call that the parts had been ordered and we could pick the rig up. excuse me!!!!! it's 1 1/ 2 hour round trip from our northwest las vegas home to cw. we left the rig there. after another 3 weeks i got to pick it up. here's where i really get irritated. the lot man brought the rig, dropped it and left. i'm there by myself trying to line up the coach to our 5th wheel, and the coach has no battery power to lift it. i walked the 50 yards back to the ""service"" department to get help. whether it was my husband or just myself hooking up, someone should be there to ensure that we're good to go. i truly wish that johnnie walker rv carried the brand we bought. we love their service department and have always felt like a valued customer. moral of this story- camping world service, whether it be located in boise or las vegas should be avoided if at all possible."
1-star,0,"not the most ethical sales people (steve t) will ruin your buying rv experience. when you go in there to make a deal with them - the first words that came out of his mouth was ""be prepared to take a big loss."" seriously!? who starts off a negotiation like that. he tried telling me the trade in value for my 2016 travel trailer would ""depend"" on what i was buying. that was the first flag. your trade in value should be your trade in value weather you buy something new or old. thats a classic sleezy salesman tactic of working it into their profits. he told me originally the trailer i wanted was in the ""high30s."" when i told him i had a trade in, he changed the price to 49k for the trailer. when i told him that was way too high of a price and i know what that trailer should go for - he lowered it to 35k within seconds! so ridicules. the guy was totally arrogant and made my skin crawl. terrible experience."
5-star,1,"i bought my 5th wheel here about a year ago, and had a positive buying experience with sten. i was even able to include a 4 year extended warranty on the used unit. a year later, this is my first experience needing service work done. and i am beyond impressed with the staff and service department! ~ prompt with communication and returning my calls. ~ they were flexible with their full schedule, seeing as i have an upcoming trip and limited time to get necessary work done. ~ they worked with my extended warranty company to get just about everything needed taken care of for my deductible. (which considering insurance warranty work is not always as simple or quick a process) ~ quoted me a very fair price for new tires. in summary, my entire experience with this camping world had exceeded my expectations! i am beyond impressed! it's very rare to find a big company like this that still upholds the small business ethics, ""valuing the customer"". i will recommend this place to anyone looking for a rv, knowing that they will stand behind their products beyond the sale."
1-star,0,"this is the worst camping world that i've ever been to and i've been to allot of them that i've lost count. i decided to buy a trailer and mike walsh was the sales person. it must had been my unluckiest day ever to have mikes name up next as the sales person. the sarcastic egotistic man needs to pull his head out of somewhere bad. then once i decided on what i wanted to buy, i had to deal with mr ashtray paul in finance. paul the finance managers office smelt like everybody just got done with a smoke-out in his closed office. i got home still choking. gag!!! but what do you expect from a gambling city? i leaned my lesson the hard way. all the camping workd misfits and rejects must get sent here to this location. i told them i wanted a 20 year loan and both mike and paul agreed, but when i signed all the paperwork a bombshell was dropped at the end that it was a 10 year loan and at the end it would automatically be started over with another 10 years, so i signed and agreed. but something bothered me a couple weeks later so i called i called the bank and found out that i had been lied to. it was a 10 year loan and a balloon payment at the end, or you could re-apply for a loan and see if you still get approved. now i smell a gimmick and probably out to get more money and a higher interest rate. so i immediately refinanced with someone i trust for the whole 20 year period. then, i had warranty work that i mostly pointed out before i took possession and that became a nightmare. they have several mikes and you constantly get transferred to the wrong one even though your specific which one you want. it seems to be something that is done on purpose by the gals that answering the phones. it gives the opertunity for the correct one to say ""i didn't get your voice message"". these sin city gamblers are game players and play stupid. they can never fix anything right the first time as if the mechanics are misfits just like the sales and finance manager. this location should shut down completely and send all the business without the employees to the henderson, nevada location to handle. and another sad thing about the las vegas location is when you buy a new trailer and want to buy things for it, their stock of items is horrible. they don't even stock a complete set of anything in any color. like i said: missfits. i would like to say ithe hot weather is the problem, but i can't because henderson nevada is just as hot there and they are great-fantastic! and then there is jesse the genderal manager here at the las vegas location, who is just there without a clue of what he is suppose to do. he just sits in his office pretending to be working and avoids handling any things. jesse is like the used salesman that never learned how to sell, but has the smile and knod down, and makes promises that the problem your having is unacceptable and tells you that he will get to the bottom of it, and yet does nothing. his title should be the babble manager. the best advise that i can give you, is never get out of your vehicle and go in. drive-drive away and go to a different location or another company that cares, because this las vegas lotion is horrible, the worst in sales, needed supplies stock, maintenance, management, and most important - customer satisfaction. please don't follow my mistakes."
5-star,1,i have had very good customer service in the parts department at this camping world. phil in the store has been very helpful in getting generic parts for my trailer and tresia in the oem parts department has been a good liaison with forest river on specific parts for my r-pod. i would use them again and recommend them for parts.
1-star,0,"i hope this helps anyone out there who are looking for a store to buy your necessities. first off go to the henderson location. they have a pretty large store and pretty much have mostly everything you need. i went to the las vegas camping world and it was so small. i went there because i had a $20.00 coupon i needed to use, so i went in to buy rv step covers. they had them, but they were higher than the internet price. there were 2 sales people there, one girl who had short black hair and had tattoos up and down her arms, and a guy who looked like he just did not care to be there. she told me that she could give me the internet price, but she would have to charge me the shipping also. i looked at her in disbelief. she said it is better to pay the price they had posted, it would be cheaper. so i bought them and a tire gauge. i used my $20.00 coupon and got in my car. something made me call the henderson las vegas camping world and talked to a service tech who just happened to answer the phone, he looked up the price online and said that the store will print out the sale page on the internet and give the price the internet has, no problem. i tried to return my rv step covers and the tattooed girl said she could only give me back the money for the rv step covers and would not give me the $20.00 coupon. she said to go to the henderson store and they would credit me because i was in the system and when they pull up my good sam membership the transaction will appear. so i guess i will be going back tomorrow. i can not believe that camping world would condone this kind of service, including all the other bad reviews. anyone who goes to this store who could be a potential good sam member would just walk out and never go into a camping world again. they also have a very small assortment of needed items for the rver, being off las vegas blvd you would think that they would be a big store with good customer service. if you are traveling and need to buy supplies for your rv or camper go to henderson. if you are going to buy an rv, go to johnnie walker rv on boulder, they have the best service guys there and everytime i go there with my rv (and i go a lot plus i am a woman who asks a lot of questions) i always get good customer service from their service department and sometimes pick up odds and ends for my rv there too. please read the other reviews, if your looking for service or sales and if you do decide to go you just might be taken from sales, service or the store. your choice!!"
1-star,0,this dealership is horrible... there service department takes forever to take care of your rv... they don't return calls. not to mention i was told by a tech not to leave any valuables in my rv because of theft there... i dropped my rv off in beginning of august and still have not gotten it back and it is the end of september.
1-star,0,"horrible service! took 2.5 weeks just to get an appt. they kept it for 2 weeks, and we finally had to call them to see where the repairs were at. they charged insane amounts for diagnosis of problems. for each small part that needed a 5 minute repair, they charged a full hour of labour, and were totally inflexible!! we had 4 small things that needed repair. their part prices are totally unreasonable. and they even forgot to repair the main problem we came in for! the service guy was a meek personality-less policy-quoting parrot. i will never take our rv to any camping world again! they have no care for customer retention nor customer satisfaction."
1-star,0,"tried to buy a new $300k motor home here today, but walked away disgusted with their misleading sales tactics and total failure to negotiate in good faith. this is the second time we've been here and we should have learned from the first time. this dealership holds out for maximum profits and is deceptive. watch out!"
1-star,0,"attention, they actually try to scam you. i was an absolute beginner last march when i bought my first motorhom ever - a used one from a private seller. i tried to do it the save way and drove with the motorhome to camping world to let them check some thdo a pre-buying check. it came out that they told me all the brakes are really in bad condition and should be replaced immediately or i will have a bad accident. they wanted to install new brake pads and new rotors, making it a 1300$ bill. i returned to the seller, he was confused, said the breaks should be fine. we had a little bit of an argument and did not stay friends in the end, he went down with the price a few hundred $, feeling bad at me, and i felt i paid too much. anyway i decided not to do the repair at camping world, because they are so slow there doing their work, i decided to do it later, eventually when the brakes start to make some noise. was driving for 3 months, nothing happened. was driving 10.000 miles, nothing, brakes are fine. 8 months later i finally thought myself that these breaks might be at their end now. i made an appointment at a small brake shop (p&o brakes in las vegas) - he had a quick look and said: well your breaks are still fine, the are not even half used. maybe one pad on the back is thinner, but still no problem. so - what on earth was the camping world staff talking about 8 months ago? why do they lie to their first time customers? i really would never go there to do a repair. i know, many people go, their service lane is always full. these people have too much money to spend. small business are much better, you talk to reliable people, you get a better price, you do not have to talk to a lady at the front desk which does not have any clue about where your motorhome is at the moment and if it will take another 5 minutes, 5 hours or 5 days. i remember that only calculating the price of the brake repair took them 1 hour. what a waste of time."
1-star,0,"please read!!! do not trust this place with absolutely anything! i had them do a 45 point inspection on a sportsmobile that i was interested in buying. after paying $300 for an inspection, i found out that they did not actually inspect 95% of the things they were supposed to! they checked things off as ok that were blatantly not working! the furnace control didn't even have batteries in it yet they said it was working properly. the fridge was broken and also checked off as ok. when i called them out on this, they would not admit fault and just lied more and more. this is the absolute worst customer service i have ever experienced and i will do everything in my power to make them pay for what they did to me. i am considering suing them for stealing my money, even if it costs me a lot of money in the process. please please please do not use this camping world for absolutely any service, you will be scammed. for the record, i reported this to a manager and nothing was done about it."
1-star,0,"horrible! terrible experience and all we needed was a ladder. if you do not need to go here don't go! the customer service is nonexistent. bad, bad, bad! this place is awful. we have been rving for 5.5 years and have gone to camping worlds across the us and, although i wouldn't give any of them a great rating for service, this one was terrible. we were second in line behind a problem issue with one customer and watched as 3 employees just walked on by... then the ladder we came to purchase was partially wrapped but we were assured it was new and fine. we got it to the rv and it was broken. we had to take it back and they didn't have another one so we had to go to the other camping world 20 miles away. we traveled over 60 miles to replace a ladder :( and the employees are just rude."
1-star,0,"i purchased a high end class a used diesel pusher from this camping world in april 2011. i was upgrading from a class c gas motorhome to this big diesel pusher. i knew very little about these larger motorhomes and kept asking lots of questions of the salesman, sales mgr, service mgr, ""diesel specialist"" salesman & location gm. my biggest question had to do with what sort of fuel mileage i could expect. they all told me that i could expect to get 10-12+mpg. well, after driving it for 2 years, at 55 mph max, in all kinds of terrain, the motorhome averages 6 mph. downhill, totally empty with the wind it might get 7mpg max. if they were just estimating the mpg for me, i might chalk up their bad advice to their ignorance. however, unbeknownst to me when i bought the rv, it has a computer which tracks mpg of trips and for the life of the rv. it has averaged 6mpg before i bought it and after i bought it! so when i was asking all these rv specialists, not one of them showed me the computer and previous mileage history. they all continued to give me totally wrong info. either they are all totally ignorant- not knowing about the computer, which is std on big diesels, or they lied to me. i know which one i think they are. needless to say i will never buy anything from them again and i highly recommend you do not do business with this group of liars. i give the 1 star only because the system won't allow 0 stars."

1-star,0,"we bought an suv from them not too long ago. we delt with matt, he was very friendly and nice but when it came down to the business of things he didn't know a whole lot. he didn't know the exact price of the vehicle we were buying (husband didn't care, he loved the suv at first sight), amongst other things. the tires on the car we low on air so we asked for them to put air but he said we can do that ourselves, also the detailer could not be found (?), so our car wasn't even clean! also only 15 day warranty on just engine and safety issues, sketchy as to other dealerships at 30 day. couple days later the car started to malfunction, take back to the dealership, they said they'll look at it and claim nothing is wrong probably bad gas. also the detailer was found and he only vacuumed the floor, bad job too. just a few days after it happens again, they tell us it's the fuel pump, also told it would be there for a day, ended up taking several (wrong ordered part they said, yeah right). couple days later it was still having the issue, matt was no longer taking our calls, sending us straight to voicemail, so we have to call the dealership. there was lots miscommunication because they were playing a game of telephone. the last time (3rd time) we take it in they finally figure out the really problem (don't know the technical name but it had something to do with a coil). they refused to give us any paperwork on the car stating since they purchased the parts and did the work they don't need to give us anything. it's my car and i would have liked something saying they worked on it at least. each time we had to drop the car off we had to get our own ride home, and when we picked it up there was always new dirt and leaves in the car, they didn't bother keeping it clean. and not once did the owner come out and talk to us himself, we were waiting for the car outside his office while he had one of his guys being messenger between us. bottom line: do not shop here."

2-star,0,"all super nice salt of the earth guys at this dealership. carland llc seems to specialize in good looking high-line autos. hummers, bmw, cadillac, mercedes benz, lexus, infinity, you name it. credit issues, no problem. just have them checked out by a certified repair facility. especially if a manufacture warranty is expired or high mileage vehicle. they do not know nor comply with arizona lemon law statute required repairs and charges. legal pressure costs time and money... your time and money, and they know it and will string you along. it may not be intentional. like i said, they are super nice guys. but when it comes to business, it's all about the money. fair enough... can't recommend them. and look at my past reviews; i am normally a 5 star rater. there are other places to do business. but if you must, have your vehicle checked out and fixed before you buy. good luck."
5-star,1,"i have worked with mike twice now and he is just as wonderful as this company is! they are always quick and easy to set up appointments with and they will come do it wherever you are so you do not have to worry about taking time off to go somewhere to get your windows fixed. pricing is very nice too, i recommend this company to everyone i know!"
5-star,1,great experience with cherry auto glass works. mike came out and fixed our mitsubishi car that my mother-in-law drives. he was great a calling to confirm a time table for when he would arrive. he was friendly and pleasant. he was detail-oriented and efficient at the same time. he made sure no debris from the trees on our driveway got in the seal for the glass. he explained the warranty on the glass and how it works. he was super nice and professional. we will definitely use this company for future glass needs. he was also really sweet to my young daughter who wanted to watch what he was doing to grandma's car. thank you mike!
5-star,1,"i needed a new windshield for my 95 ford pick-up and did not want to use my insurance. i went to a site called glass.net and put my request in and cherry auto glass was one of the three that was suggested. i picked cherry auto glass and placed my order at 7 pm. at 7:30 pm i received a called from vino, who advised he received my order and i scheduled my appointment. i was shocked i received a phone call back so soon, i figured i they would call the next day. mike the installer called me and told me he was 10 min out, he showed up at my work place on time and was very polite and professional. he was in uniform and drove a company truck, which made me feel they were not a fly by night business and replaced my windshield quickly. i would use cherry auto glass again and the price was very reasonable."
5-star,1,"so i'm driving on the 101 and a rock jumps up and hits my windshield. it was a small chip and i figured ""hey it could be worse"". the next day it was worse...it was a crack across my windshield. after finding out i didn't have glass coverage on my policy, i got a little nervous and after calling around i got some quotes and i was not happy...everything from $260 plus tax to 300 plus dollars and they were not even able to get me in in the next few days. it was friday early evening and i had to make money this weekend...i drive for lyft. i had almost given up when i contacted cherry glass works. i got a call back within the hour from vino and was quoted a price way lower than the other places and was told they could be at my place first thing in the morning...wow i thought. sure enough the next morning mike showed up, right on time, and got to work. in under an hour he had pulled out the cracked windshield and had it replaced...i watched what he did and asked questions along the way...he answered all of my questions and took the time to show me the correct process in replacing a windshield. i was and still am very impressed. in a day and age where people try to save money and business try to cut corners i feel like i got way better service than i paid for...cherry glass works is the real deal and i for one am so happy i found them..."
5-star,1,"my experience with cherry auto glass works was incredible! i spoke with safelite who quoted me $340.00, another local company that quoted $299 and then when i spoke with the guys at cherry auto glass works i was floored when i received a quote for $198. i had to make sure they heard which car i had to make sure they were putting everything in right. they are honest, professional and do great work! mike was my technician and he was polite, patient and an amazing representation of the company. he was prompt to my home, educated me on the process and list of charges, informed me how best to treat the glass in the days to come and did great work. i had such a fiasco with my insurance and cherry auto glass works, especially mike (seriously, give the guy a raise, he is a great talent), helped make everything so smooth. 5 stars, two thumbs up!"
5-star,1,"this review is as much a praise of cherry glass as it is a scorn for safelite. i had safelite repair a chip in the my windshield and that day, a crack appeared and started spreading and within 5 days, the crack spanned the entire windshield. no support from safelite. i called around tucson for other quotes and found cherry auto glass. they were able to replace my windshield at my house, sooner, with better customer service, and very competitive prices to all the other quotes i received, including safelite. i will return for future auto glass needs. the only less than perfect part of this experience was some plastic/foam debris left in the interior of the car."
4-star,1,"this chevron sells hotdogs for above and beyond two dollars... why are you can buy a package of eight hotdogs for less than a dollar, i feel like it's above and beyond right... of course if you can shove one in your mouth while you're making another one that reduces the price by half..."
5-star,1,"newer gas station, adequately staffed in the carwash area. i was immediately greeted by an attendant. i chose the middle of the line 11.00 wash. there was no waiting, pulled right into the wash. i liked the towel dry to keep those pesky water spots away. they finished it off with tire shine. fast, efficient, good quality, and fair price. no complaints."
3-star,0,"nice gas station, decent prices on gas. if you happen to be the outskirts of vegas. of course they also have a nice little market, and the standard car wash"
5-star,1,"stopped at the pit stop car wash on dean martin. automatic wash with attendants to pre-wash and dry/wax your vehicle. their $14 wash includes the wash, carnival wax, hand dry, tire dressing and an air freshener. they also have full detail services available. they always do a nice job!"
4-star,1,"ok - here's what's great about this place... i drove from la to vegas to meet family for a mini-vaca. we have this thing in our family about cars always being clean... i would say it's actually a little nutty honestly. so as i'm driving into vegas, i'm worrying on how i'm going to find a car wash. and then i take an exit - just a few miles from the strip - and find this little bit of heaven in the form of a full-service car wash/gas station/market. score! this is not one of those ""diy"" car washes or a generic automated wash system. there are actual people cleaning and vacuuming the interior of your car. and the price for a full-service wash was beyond reasonable. there's even a little patio area where you can sit and return phone calls or enjoy a snack while your car is being tended to. the only downside for me - it's one of those car washes that require you to drive onto the tracks and - look, i just cannot do that. i have a car with a large front end and trying to maneuver onto these narrow tracks is not something i do easily - it's like asking me to back into a parking space... not going to happen. but i was able to convince one of the friendly guys working there to do it for me - and of course, i tipped generously for the extra service! this will probably become a regular stop on my vegas itineary."
4-star,1,"this is my favorite chevron gas station in town. it's located right off the freeway exit at cactus, making it super convenient for filling up my tank close to home. since it's located in a safer part of town, i don't feel like my car is going to get stolen or that a creepy guy is going to start talking to me. whenever i stop, it's never crowded and i've never had to wait for a pump. it's easy to maneuver your car around the lot if you so happen to get stuck in one of those middle pumps. the ground is clean, and by that i mean that there aren't gas spills with all that kitty litter looking stuff everywhere. the convenient store is stocked well and the employees are friendly enough. they also have a car wash service with employees towel drying your car for an extra fee. i can't say much about the restroom since i try to avoid public restrooms all together. that is all!"
5-star,1,always pleasant and courteous. love this gas station. it is convenient pit stop to and from home. thank you to all the employees for for the neighborhood pit stop
5-star,1,this car wash is fantastic. the workers are fast friendly and do a wonderful job. i will absolutely come here now. my suv looks brand new! thank you!
1-star,0,"stay away from this car wash unless you like to overpay for a horrible job. $28 for a 5 minute wipe down, leaving behind water spots and glossy interior that left behind stains. when approached about the horrible job the guy shrugged his shoulders and said ""some cars shine more than others"". this was my fiancés car and her first experience at this location but we will absolutely never go back. there's a terrible herbst around the corner, use that one instead!"
5-star,1,"great customer service with a friendly smile. they did a great job on both my vehicles receiving a full service which was only $20 each. there was a supervisor there checking to make sure all the cars were ""good to go"" before it was done. the waiting area inside the gas station was cleaning and cool. thanks for the great service will be back!"
5-star,1,"i've never been at this pit stop before i just wanted to say that ""donna"" is so courteous to all that comes in the store. it should be more pleasant greeters like her. look forward to many more happy returns if she is in there working!!! must be a management program that she can fit in with the company!"
2-star,0,"i live right down the road from this chevron so i was excited for it to open as a matter of convenience. however based off of my last experience there i will never be returning during daytime hours. i pulled up to get gas and was immediately approached by one of the car wash attendants. he tried to sell me on a car wash and i politely said no. he kept going, and i kept telling him no i didn't want a carwash, and again the carwash attendant kept pressing the matter. i shouldn't need to say no more than once for someone to back off, especially when it's lunch time during a workday. i just want to get my gas in peace. i'll drive up the street a mile next time to get gas elsewhere."
5-star,1,everyone at this place was very friendly and helpful. very clean!!! will definitely be going back:) we will be using this place more frequently.
5-star,1,great new location right off the i-15 and cactus. all of the team members there are excellent and very friendly. would definitely recommend getting your next detail done here!
1-star,0,agree with dustin. that woman is the worst. she is so slow takes an hour to ring you up and pisses off half the customers. every time i go in someone is mad at her. she needs to go
1-star,0,"needed emergency milk and didn't want to go too far. paid $3.69 for a gallon of milk when everywhere else it is $1.89-2.00. i hate myself for buying it as i was almost paying twice as much and that doesn't sit well with me. i don't like throwing out $$. the place outside is always dirty, with flying paper, debris and cartons you bump into when you walk if you are not careful. store inside looks grimy. i wouldn't drink coffee from a place like this even if i withdrawing from caffeine. strange looking folks there --make me nervous. won't be back."
1-star,0,"i can't wait until qt reopens down the street. this parking lot is horrible, you are trapped until you can pull through getting gas. the cashier that's walkways there, woman with accent, will forget your items and take forever checking you out, they are always out of coffee and the outside always looks like it hasn't been swept in decades."
1-star,0,"so, i had a morning meeting and stopped at this circle k for a cup of decaf on my way back. i parked on the priest road side and had to walk over a huge semi-flattened cardboard box to get to the door (or else walk behind a vehicle that was about to back out). nothing outside had been cleaned or swept in years, apparently. the inside of the store was no cleaner. it was about 10 a.m. and there was a sign on the decaf pot saying it was not available, but please ask and they would brew some. like i wanted to hang around this crap-hole of a circle k while they brewed a pot of coffee. yuck."
4-star,1,being new to the area. i like to take my morning stroll here to get my coffee. which i think is better than dunkin donuts coffee and 1/3 of the price of what they charge. how could you go wrong with $1 a cup for any size from 1pm - 1am. this place is more than just a corner store. i seen someone buying a carton eggs from here. i don't know the freshness of them but who am i to judge. this is a one stop shop for me. from coffee to breakfast to booze. too bad they don't have stock for this store.
1-star,0,"i get that it's circle k and that one's expectations generally aren't that high, but wow. this could possibly be the worst circle k i've been to, and that's saying a lot. there are gas pumps... two of them. in a lot that is so small that anytime you pull in you run the risk of running into someone or having someone run into you. any time i've ever been there there's almost been an accident. it's almost impossible to maneuver your car in and out of parking spots. and if you try to get gas first thing in the morning, you'll be waiting a while. because there are only 2 pumps, only 4 cars can gas up at a time. and it's usually big construction trucks that sit their trucks at the pump then take their sweet time inside and pumping. meanwhile, you're sitting there, waiting. finally a car leaves, but of course it's on the wrong side, and you can't get out of the spot you're in so you keep waiting. worst place to get gas, ever! the staff is less than friendly, and there's one lady there who will always point towards the ucf change bucket as you're checking out and say, ""help the children?"" if you say yes, and drop a few coins in you get a ""have a blessed day."" if you don't, say you're paying with a card and have no cash, you get met with stink-eye and a grudging, ""have a nice day."" don't try to guilt me into giving to charity! i'm pretty sure i've done more for charity than you ever will. the homeless crackheads love to sit outside, staring at you as you go in and out, which is almost worse than panhandling. it's just creepy. basically, i'd avoid this circle k unless you are in dire straights. there's another one on 8th st and alma school which is far less scary with more gas pumps. go there instead!"
1-star,0,"i come in here often and usually have good service. but today i went with my friend to buy beer and the clerk was extremely rude. i'm 21 and only had my vertical id so we were denied service. i understood and knew they were just doing their job and told her so but as we were about to leave she rudely asked if i realized i had ""screwed my friend out of beer"" and made a few other comments insinuating my id was fake. i look young and had a vertical id so i understand being denied but i don't like being disrespected for no reason or treated like a liar, especially when i am being polite"
1-star,0,"when in to fill up my car. when i requested for an air service, attendant gave me the look. he wants to charge me a dollar . went to the next frys gas station next block. attendant gladly helped me with the air service for free even without buying gas never went back to circle k . frys is now my favorite gas station. me and my family spend about $150 a week for gas."
5-star,1,"stop in here often! this location is always clean, friendly and has so much in stock. the great additional things are : they have a special milkshake machine that's great for the kiddos. soft drinks for .89 cents daily!! get the circle k membership card for even more savings & special deals. they just finally added the chicken rollers that are really good!! they have about 5 different flavors offered here! plus delicious hot dogs, nacho's, snacks galore, munchies and so much more!! gas prices are fair and they offer the fry's discounts.."
1-star,0,"this store was absolutely disgusting! the soda area was so sticky and covered in soda, and the hot dog and condiment stations were revolting. i like a cheap hot dog occasionally, but seeing their nastiness made me turn away and walk out immediately!"
1-star,0,"this used to be a good a circle k, especially the old night staff. went in and went to counter and my fiancé asked for two packs of cigarettes and the rude gentleman rolled his eyes as he had to walk two feet away to grab them. when he came back he pointed at me and said i need to see her id and that's that. i would have no issue furnishing my proof of 30! however he was down right arrogant, rude and disrespectful. if you hate your job get a new one. i politely responded you don't have to be so rude and told my fiancé we would take our business elsewhere. both of the circle k locations on gilbert/pecos and val vista/pecos need a serious revamping of night time employees. it's worth driving farther to go to a gas station where the workers at least pretend to like there jobs. the guy was bigger, and had glasses, was working at 10:30pm on 11/22. thanks to him, my $100 weekly gas trip will be taken to valero."
4-star,1,"nice clean store with plenty of food, snack and drink options to go with you fill up of gas. also the coffee is a dollar after 1pm. i like the harvest spice coffee with the pumpkin and sweet cream creamers."
1-star,0,"wow is all i can say on how dirty this place is, bathrooms are totally just bad,trash on the floor,writing on the walls,no paper towels,no soap and it stinks like it has never been cleaned. then if you dare to go to the little foodcourt thing ( where you get you drinks,hot dog etc.) that is not even clean. its sticky there's trash on the counters the coke machines and the flow nozzles look like they have not been cleaned for a long time. and that's not even the crazy part about this ck, the crazy part is that there is about 4-5 employees just standing around kicking it. the line from the check out counter was so long that it reach the freezer where you get ice and still every one who works there is just chillin . look i am not into bashing any one or anything on this social media thing but man just work on the employees on keeping the place clean and efficient (that is what they get paid for.) and to the manger/employees i hope you don't think working at ck is to hard or you think your not getting paid enough or what ever just be happy you can get out of bed and head to a job."
1-star,0,"this is my corner store, and it is one if the dirtiest stores i have ever been to. the garbage cans are always over full the bathrooms are filthy. the store is poorly run."
1-star,0,"this used to be a great clean store. but now it is a dump. cups and lids are always empty, garbage all over the floor. floor is sticky or wet all the time. if something is empty you have to wait in line to tell a clerk and then wait some more to see if they will fix it. the charter school across the street uses this store as a pick up spot, so after school hours the place is swarming with rude school age kids blocking the soors, running around in the parking lot. there is a new store a few miles up the road, i will be going there from now on"
1-star,0,disgusting bathrooms - trash all over the parking lot and a line not worth a cup of coffee....which after seeing the toilets definitely not buying a food item
4-star,1,for a circle k this place has it going on 2nd circle k that has impressed me. it's close to home so i drop in for a little h2o or the occasional snack.....
5-star,1,this place is awesome. i never have to wait to fill up the gas and there's a huge convenience store that has everything except decent air freshener. there's always a line at this store and the bathrooms are very clean. i always make it a point to stop by when i'm in town every year.
1-star,0,"worst place in phoenix! just bought a new truck and as it came out of the wash there was a huge dent in the door!! and guess what these geniuses said? ""oh that was there!"" seriously??!! had them show me their camera footage and pointed out that it was not there before and all i got was denial! as i was leaving the ""manager"" said ""i know a guy who does body work on the side. we can split the cost"". what? what kind of unprofessional behavior is that? i spoke with the dealer that sold me the truck and he told me they had dented the top of his wife's brand new suv and claimed it was ""already like that!"" do yourself a favor and steer clear of this place."
5-star,1,this place is getting a big thumbs up from this ole gal. i was driving lyft saturday when a lady had an accident in my car leaving feces in my back seat of a brand new car. took it to the cobblestone in tempe that was less than accommodating. still a tinge of fecal matter. when i came to this location here in surprise they treated me like royalty. there were 4 cars ahead of me but when the manager anthony heard my story and knew i had been in tempe location waiting for over 3 hours. he rushed my car to the front of the line and did the clean up himself at no additional charge. everyone was so nice and very compassionate. i'll take all my business here in the future and always recommend this location. drew was also awesome as was dylan. chris gets a big thumbs up as well. thanks for making this bad situation not as bad. josh d will take care of any glass needs you have while waiting for your car to finish wether it's detail or wash. love this place. my fast pass has already paid for itself.
5-star,1,"i just want to express my gratitude to all the employees at cobblestone.especially drew, they are very professional kind knowledgeable. i have been a fast pass member for six months. my car always comes out perfect. yesterday when getting my car washed my battery died. the stuff could've just said well your car doesn't work. the staff jumpstart my car and explain to me what was going on. if not for that i probably would've been stranded somewhere else i will always be a fast pace member at cobble stone"
1-star,0,"do not go here! i paid for a clay bar buff & shine and an interior detail. i sat there for 8 hours while they ""worked on my truck"". when i got it back the inside looked okay except for a bunch of soap stains they'd left on a few seats. they even put up my back seat to try to hide it from me. worst of all, they didn't buff out a single scratch. it looked like they did, but once my truck got dusty the next day, you could clearly see all the scratches still. i will never ever use a cobblestone again. do yourself a favor & do the same too!"
5-star,1,i go here a few times a month. the car is always clean and especially the windows. i like the fact that they use air guns to dry out the places where they can't get with the towels. also a plus they have high pressure air guns in their vacuum stations to blast out your vents and hard to reach places. i would recommend this spot to anyone.
1-star,0,"this is a greedy heartless company who broke my car. i took my car in for an oil change, blade replacement and filter, it was $150. it was expensive, but it was a sunday and hardly anyone is open, i was visiting surprise from prescott and thought i better just get my oil changed knowing i was driving out of state in a week and i might not find the time before i leave. got out of state, was on my way home when my car stopped in the middle of the highway. luckily there was nobody behind me when i went from 80 to 50 in seconds and out of nowhere. to keep it short, i was stranded in utah for a week, spent over $1000 in hotel, rental car, towing and mechanical expenses. my tow alone was $500 because i was 100 miles from the nearest town. the toyota dealership checked it out and told me the engine seized from have no oil. and there was zero leak or sign of burning oil. my car was worthless. i was stuck out of state with no help. to replace the engine on my prius was going to $4400. the emotional and financial damage this has caused me was life changing. i am a 28 year old single mom with 3 small children, cobblestone did absolutely nothing to help me and the denied. that it was their fault. obviously my oil was not changed, and they were completely careless. and conveniently their security tapes were erased the day before i called them. i had to drain my entire savings to buy an older car to get me by and my kids to school. this place should be ashamed of themselves. they dismiss an issue that they were at fault. they make plenty of money off their customers to handle this situation right. i am now out a good reliable car that i bought only a year ago, i had bought an electric car so i could afford the gas for my little family on a single women's wages, me spending $150 was a complete rip off as well since my car wasn't serviced, i am out the $1000 it took me just to get my car off the road and me back to arizona, and drained all of my saving of $3,000 because i had to buy a car i feel won't last me long."
4-star,1,"i've been coming to this place for years and for the most part they have been pretty good. they do a good job on my vehicles which i take almost every week. thomas is always friendly and polite when i see him and even took care of the whole transaction when i purchased the fast pass. bonus, they have dunkin dounuts"
1-star,0,"i just spent $29.00 on a wash and it was awful. interior not wiped down in areas, the window are smeared and the vacuuming was so bad i had to redo it myself. i specifically told them to take care of the interior and was told they would do a great job. when i complained about the crappy job, i was told they only do a ""light dusting"" inside and that their vacuums do not fit under the seats. wtf. if i could give this place no stars i would. highway robbery. such thieves and liars."
1-star,0,"horrible! i still have several prepaid coupons for washes, i'm going to give those away. my wife has a monthly pass, when finished, she's done. they do a sloppy, half assed, unprofessional, horrible job. we're going to tnt from now on."
1-star,0,"i got the $30 ultimate car wash, which means they clean the interior and exterior. the exterior is relatively clean (still has dirt around the handles and on the trunk somehow). the interior looks like it wasn't touched at all. seriously. the interior got a quick vacuum and that was it. i still have fingerprints on my screen, bits of garbage in my door, smudges all over my interior that weren't wiped down, the seats weren't wiped or vacuumed. to be honest, the only thing that looks like they did was run it through a crappy automatic car wash and did the fastest cheapest vacuum possible. never go."
5-star,1,"so i got an easy-pass for the speedy (cheap) car wash. it's 15.99 a month for unlimited washes and free vacuum. they have a dunkin donuts inside, so you can get fat (or in my case fatter) while you wait. amanda brooks"
1-star,0,"the guys at the lube shop are very rude. i spent a half hour arguing with them because they didn't want to do an uber inspection on my car. once i talked them into it, it took them less than a minute to do. i'll never be bringing my car here again."
1-star,0,"i had the misfortune to have my car cleaned at this establishment. they did very poor work, walked away after starting detailing my car. after watching my car set unfinished for over 15 minutes i approached a green shirt employee to ask why the employee returned. he worked on the car for a minute he waved for me to get my car. the inside had not been touched and the marker they put on the window had not been wiped off. i've had bad service at this location before but thought i'd give them another try since they are twice as close to my house. i will never use cobblestone again."
5-star,1,they did a great job. oil change and ultimate car wash all in 45mins. well done will come back to this location. quick service. great price coupon helped with cost.
1-star,0,"horrible..i've been a few times now and have not been happy with the result, lousy, rushed jobed..no pride in the work. does anyone do a decent car wash? ?"
5-star,1,we went there to get an uber inspection and we where in and out in 10 min the guys there where kind and considered we had no problems with them
5-star,1,i prefer the ultimate package. not the basic or the high priced value but they do a great job on keeping my ride on fleek.
1-star,0,"(reposting feedback after yelp removed it due to inclusion of a name) poor job overall. still dead bugs on hood and front. the wash sales person offered specifically to have black marks on door sills, arm rest, seats, etc removed - terrible job! i was able to clean the center console arm rest in about 30 seconds, and it only took me a minute to get the door sills clean - it's like they didn't even try! i'd have raised the issue at the time, but the car had already taken longer than promised and i was late for work. so not happy with this waste of money..."
1-star,0,"tunnel is broken every time we come. car was brought in for detail. it was as dirty as it was when we brought it in. sides of seats were not vacuumed and spots on windows. when i addressed the issue to ""tyler"" who acts like some punk prison kid, he's unprofessional. everyone else is working he's in a office directing orders and it took 15 minutes to get him out of his office. all i got was i can wait and have it done again and he shrugged his shoulders at me and walked off. won't be back or refer this hole to anyone."
5-star,1,"i just want to thank the manager spencer for the amazing service. they where closing and my car was real dirty i seen one associate cleaning up and closing which was the manager spencer. he took me in was very kind and professional. very caring human being, looked out for me and gave me a car wash. amazing person i recommend it for everyone! clean and professional wash. thanks spencer!"
1-star,0,"probably one of the worst detail jobs i have ever seen. paid $400 for one of the best packages they had because i just drove here from alaska and didn't want to deal with cleaning my truck. i was told it would take 2hrs, typical time for a detail. 4 hrs later they finished. thinking t took them longer because it was a better job, i was sadly mistaken. mud was still all over my mirrors, door handles, door jams and floor mats. they didn't touch the inside of the windows or the vents. it was just a overall shit job. not worth the price or time, and i would never recommend to anyone. pay for a drive through wash and get a better job."
5-star,1,"my girlfriend and i love the fast pass. we have it on two of our vehicles and use our all the time. obviously if you only bring a car in once, some areas will be missed. but bring it in constantly abs it comes or great."
1-star,0,absolutely terrible customer service at this location. the front end manager has a horrible demeanor . she will suck the life right out of your morning by overcharging you. every time we use this location the work is shotty and we have to have the car go through the line again
1-star,0,"got an oil change on my truck there. as far as i know, they didn't mess that up. got an ultimate car wash for my truck and told them i need to get gas. they did not bother telling me that i could have saved money on my gas if i bought the car wash at the gas pump... when i got my truck back there were many spots where you could see that they had missed. prior to buying my car wash i bought a $200 detail wash for my wife's truck. took my wife's truck in for a detail and four hours later when we went to pick it up, it was cleaned anything but detail. with in five minutes of an easy look over of the truck there were over a dozen different spots where you could see that they missed. another hour later and it still wasn't to satisfaction. finally out of frustration just took the truck and drove it home. will not be going back plain and simple they need somebody to look over every vehicle prior to releasing it to the customer."
4-star,1,i've had issues here but they do try to make it right. bring a lot of company trucks here so they do know i am a repeat customer. some employees have been here for a long time which is nice. never had anything stolen either and that should give them 5 stars lol!
1-star,0,"shorting yelp's stock tomorrow morning. any company that makes a habit of disenfranchised, honest reviews to be heard, will go in the tank. i'm no ichan, but i have a few bucks and even more connections. enjoy your ride down to plug status."
1-star,0,"this is a terrible place to get any service done on your vehicle. it all starts as you pull up to into the drive through to get your vehicle vacuumed. you can't just tell them what wash you want and leave. they'll majorly try to upsell their other services to you. half the time, you really don't even need it done! i understand it's part of profit and business, however, these people need to learn to back away. oh, and the whole windshield chip repair is a scam. they don't even fix anything! it cost me $75.00 for an oil change and tire rotation!! come to find out, they don't include this payment on your loyalty points card! go to tnt car wash down the road on grand. better service, better prices, better people."
1-star,0,"i've never been a fan, ever since i was here years ago and they tried to get me to buy a package, i said no and they flunked up my car. my (x) husband came back weeks later for a $10 car wash, and left with the $180 package each - for both of our cars!! yeah, saw him coming a mile away! i hate the sales pitches. just give me the half assed car wash. we just moved back, i have my ca plates, needed to get all of the collective i-5 amd i-10 bugs off my grill, and was blown away with the ""fear"" that they use for the poor out of state people ""the paint is being eaten off with the bugs enzymes..."". lmfao! i can't imagine how much they make off of the snowbirds! go to tnt across the street. i need to remember to do the same."
2-star,0,yes not my first choice and only used them when i got gas and a discounted exterior wash. when i had full service washes they could never get the interior clean or i would have to ask them to do touch ups. i rather go down the street to tnt carwash in surprise.
2-star,0,need better customer service. i had a coupon to try them. they made me jump through hoops to use it. then the outdoor guy said i would have to drive home to print it out instead of downloading on my iphone. he thought he would make everything ok. by throwing out a bunch of christmas platitudes. that was down right annoying! i went back into the store for a third time and finally someone walked out to assist and make sure all went well. there was only one person behind the counter that was worth this and she was young and friendly. the older people who should have known better all they did was complain and gripe about other people.
2-star,0,"sad to say, but the overall satisfaction with this conrad's location has dropped some. there is a tech here, brian who is top notch. he makes things right and goes the extra mile. the problem, it seems, is that they are opening locations faster than they can get technicians. so, they keep taking them out of this location leaving it short handed. the result is longer wait times and overly stressed staff that is struggling to keep up. come on conrad's make this right and let this location be what it once was and should be again!"
1-star,0,"got a $50 oil change, a week later my car was leaking oil. i basically had to stalk the manager to get it resolved. then once i found out i would be receiving reimbursement for the initial service (not what i spent to fix it) the manager hung up on me. thanks conrads. never again"
1-star,0,"long time customer of conrad's but very disappointed in how mayfield handled a recent issue. a few months ago, had a screw in my driver side rear tire and stopped into mayfield (closest conrad's) late in the day. brian, service manager on duty, was very helpful in getting a new tire on my car. i was so impressed, i returned to have the other 3 replaced and 4 new tires put on our other vehicle within 2 weeks so almost $2000 spent on tires at conrad's. however, i noticed on my car the first tire that had been put on, the rim looked like it had been taken off with a crowbar! it looked like it was beat to crap. the other 3 rims looked fine. i returned to conrad's and spoke with steve and mark (managers on duty). steve was incredibly rude and condescending, stating it was impossible that his technician had caused it the damage and it was normal wear/tear. i pointed out that if it was normal wear/tear, the other 3 would have similar damage unlike the damage that is specifically around the rim. finally steve threw a bone and said they (mark) would provide me with conrad's partner who repairs this kind of damage and would contact me.. this was in early august and 6 weeks later, i have never heard back. for the amount of money i have spent at conrad's in 10+ years, bringing 4 cars in for tires or service, this is how conrad's treats customers???"
5-star,1,i've had nothing but great experiences. purchased new tires and they matched online pricing. when i went to get them rotated they were able to fit me in the day i called. great service and great people!
4-star,1,"service at conrad's is usually hit or miss. i'm guessing that it really depends on the management of each store. there are some conrad's stores, like willoughby, that i refuse to go to. this location is the complete opposite. this is the only conrad's i actually trust. if you call multiple conrad's locations and ask them for a quote, mayfield is always the most inexpensive."
1-star,0,"i just wish there was a way to give negative stars. went to do a lease return with my friend and got extremely disappointed. they tried selling a new car, when we said we are not interested they threatened to charge extra for cleaning, dents, any wear and tear that the car might have although the car had just been at a body shop, polished, washed and looked spotless. they started ignoring us to a point where noone was talking to us, not answering our questions and telling us that they will only take the car back today if we bought a new one. it was my friends first kia and he will never buy another one. the ac didnt work on a brand new car and they were never able to fix it. they blamed extreme heats in las vegas. cmon, we all own cars and a car without an ac is worthless here. this dealership is the worst there can be. even if i was looking to get a kia i would get it from someplace else and not this dealership. the management lacks customer service skills and all they care about is selling a car at any cost."

1-star,0,on 11-7-13 me and my wife traded in a h2 for a gas saving kia optima. our sales person was good. we spent several hrs working on the trade. finally paid full price less 10k trade in. we were ok with that. now on the 11-26 the finance department wants us to resign and won't return my calls. with thanksgiving only two days away we can't make it in until after. i really just wanted the finance guy contact us so we could relax and enjoy our thanksgiving day off. now we are stressing about the contract and not happy. i will let everyone know on friday if we still have our kia. also i almost forgot they never payed off the balance owned on the h2 and the payment was due on 11-18. now i look like an idiot. thanks a lot :(

4-star,1,"where some car dealerships are equipped with pushy sales people and annoying sales managers, courtesy kia provided a pleasurable experience when buying our car. we were greeted by volker who answered all of our questions and didn't hesitate to take us for a joy ride. negotiations were painless as well. he came back from the back with some leasing and purchase prices. we came up with a bottom line price before we got there and we let him know that was the price that would get us in a vehicle that day. he went back one more time and came back with the good news that we are the proud owners of a kia soul. the car was cleaned up and filled with fuel while we filled out our paperwork. a great experience with an excellent salesman, i would do business here again and would recommend courtesy to anyone who is looking for anew or used vehicle.."
5-star,1,"i'm a first-time new car buyer and left here with a new kia forte in my desired price range. the whole process was relatively quick, easy, and painless. my salesman, a.j. was extremely friendly and didn't put any unnecessary pressure on me. i'm very happy with my experience!"
1-star,0,avoid the lot on sundays. the mall cops they hire on sundays are rude morons. sales men are like any other used car salesmen. one star because the mall cop insulted me thinking an asian woman with a one year old is out to steal a car at 11 am on sunday. i'll drive to los angeles for a better deal and service.
1-star,0,"horrible horrible service department had a am appointment. when i got there no one was outside with the service line almost 10 deep. then a service tech came out and said i am the only one here, i need help. after 30 minutes finally someone came out to help me. i asked how long will my service be? my advisor told me 1 hour. i came back 2 1/2 hours later and they said i am set to go. i checked my car and it just sat there for 2 1/2 hours. no one even looked at it. i was told they were short handed. why was i told work was done when it was not? i talk to the sr. advisor and he told me there is nothing i can do? what? i sat there waiting. and waiting...until my salesperson came and he said he would take care of it. if i had known i was getting this type of customer service that took nearly 5 1/2 hours, i certainly would not have bothered to get my car here. buyers beware."

5-star,1,after showing up to just look for a car this morning robert and aj made it such a great experience we ended up purchasing a new vehicle. there were none of the pressures of buying a new car just an overall great experience. i would definitely recommend.
4-star,1,"my experience with the service department here is complete opposite of what i am reading on these other reviews. gary fox is who we dealt with and he was very professional and courteous with us. he greeted us and checked in with us as he could. he didn't b.s. us or try to get us to more work. we went in to get some sensors replaced. my only suggestion is to shop around. it ended up being the best deal for us to go to the dealership for what we needed fix. now, i can't say this is going to be the case every time but i feel confident that a dealership is going to use new factory parts versus what another place might use. would i come back? heck yes. i was a very happy and satisfied customer."
5-star,1,"i have nothing but positive things to say about this dealership. i had an awesome sales guy named ""el"". he was helpful in every aspect. no hard core sales, he worked the numbers & made everything right. drove off with the exact car i wanted. i didn't have to compromise at all & got a payment i was totally satisfied with. service department has been great also. i love my car & get compliments just about everyday. thanks guys!!!"

1-star,0,"took my finance's brother in to buy a car at courtesy import kia, however the sales manager was a complete douchebag... rude and unknowledgable of his own product, their reputation totally precedes their low online reviews. however, we met another salesperson, mike sharma, sales manager of courtesy imports mazda and he totally blew us away. he took us around on few test drives on the car that my brother was considering. i've met a lot of car salesman and by he was the knew so much about not only mazda's products but other companies as well. sure enough he was able to convince us to buy him the new mazda moto 6 2014. from beginning to end, he was so cool and never pressured us to buy a car unlike the dumb salesman from kia. we stopped by the same weekend with my fiancee's grandparents and made a purchase. the deal was fast, quick, and painless.... how a car buying experience should be. despite the horrible reviews on yelp and on google about both these dealerships, i have to say, mike sharma is seriously the guy who is holding this place together by a thread. thanks man! fyi, the douchebag is luis, the sales manager of kia. what a idiot!!!"
2-star,0,"in 2012, i went to kia and got a bad deal. they wasted my time and broke the window on my car. they had the car i wanted so this week, i went back and bought it. the first sales agent kevin didn't even call me back. i had to hound them over and over. i'm new to this country so my credit rating is a little low but my account says paid on time for everything. kevin said this is what happens when you give me a 500 credit score. (mine is 599) i got a new sales rep and closed the deal two days ago. last night, my driver side tire blew. it took 45 minutes to find the key to unlock the lug nuts on the tires cause no one showed me where it was. then; though i did not hit anything, courtesy kia refuses to replace the tire.... so 2 days after i get my car i had to shell out $150 for a tire! now that's customer service. they got two stars thanks to the finance guy chuck and the 2nd sales rep, nate....."
1-star,0,"i wish i would read the review from yelp before going to this place. experience was horrible. i was lied to and given excuses, week after week, on why their company failed to satisfy the agreed upon terms. the car they sold me was a dud, it automatically went into neutral on two occasions as i was driving. nobody even called me back after calling and leaving a message to advise them of the problem. there was also a 7500 rebate on the vehicle which they never informed me about and pocketed for themselves."
1-star,0,"i went in knowing exactly what i wanted and what i didn't want. the salesperson was nice, but since they didn't have what i wanted, he kept pushing me to buy cars i didn't want. like other reviewers have mentioned, the floor manager was extremely pushy and rude, he got very pissy because i said i wanted to think about, purchasing a car i didn't want to begin with. it was just a terrible experience over all. if you want a mazda check out the dealer on west sahara or centennial. both were very helpful, not pushy, and honest."
1-star,0,"about a week and a half ago 6/7, i embarked on a trip from southern california to the east coast with my mother. i had recently gotten my air conditioning fixed in my mazda 3 for the occasion knowing that we'd be driving through several deserts. leaving without that fixed is just dangerous, right?! well, it had been working well for a couple days but, by the time we were on the outskirts of las vegas it started to blow 117 degree air at us. i heard one person say that it was the hottest day of the year so far. i called my mazda dealer from socal and they said to bring it to a dealer out there to keep the warranty on the new parts. so! i came upon courtesy mazda in henderson. i walked in and told them my story (1:00pm i'm guessing) by this point my temperature gauge was reading 119 degrees. they flat out said no, and that they would not be able to get to it till monday (6/10). trying to go anywhere else would have been dangerous at temps like that and the closest dealer centennial mazda said the same thing. i even considered driving at night but, that wouldn't have been safe either. that would have forced me to stay in vegas over the weekend with no air conditioning and probably paying for an expensive hotel. luckily, there is a good person there. the woman at the service desk was very helpful in finding us a great shop. they fixed it that day in a matter of hours while, having to order the parts too. he tried to get the parts from courtesy and they turned out to cost $900 alone. for the parts and labor i payed $700. !!!beware of these swines!!! you people give american business a bad name. you should be receiving a package of elephant poop (1 gallon) from poopsenders any day now, think of it as a metaphor for your shitty service... yours truly, your very own anti-customer."

(they make you sign a paper saying if they agree to your terms, you'll buy the car.) it's bs it doesn't mean anything so don't let them fool you. if you decide you need a new mazda enough that you go there, read all your paperwork twice and don't give in to bullying!"

1-star,0,"we use to love desert heat automotive when it was under the ownership of kevin and the care of kevin and kurt. that was 2 owners ago. they are no longer there so anyone who thinks they are, don't be fooled. the next owner was okay but they only did one fix on our van which worked so i'll say they were fine, but they don't own it anymore either so that doesn't even matter anymore. this review is for the latest. i am so beyond furious right now. a couple months ago we took our car in to get fixed. there were apparently multiple fixes, each coming in at a higher price, but what could i do, i needed my car fixed, so i approved the fixes. going in to pick up my car when it was done i was surprised by the cost. it was almost 50% higher than what was quoted. i was floored and learned that when he was quoted me prices he never included the labor price, just parts. who does that! i've never had a mechanic quote me just parts not labor! but what could i do, i paid it and left, knowing i wouldn't be back. unfortunately that was not the case. starting my car for the first time to leave that parking lot i noticed something was wrong. my car was shaking so bad. it was worse than when i brought it in. when we tried bringing it back in and my husband explained the shaking, they had the nerve to tell him that that's how cars are, they shake when they are cool and just had to warm up. how stupid did they think we were! one of their repairs was the motor mounts and my husband pointed out to them that it's probably the motor mounts. the owner told us that couldn't be it but he would take it back to try and figure it out. after not hearing from them for 2 days, i get a call saying they are still stumped and trying to figure it out. the following week, i finally call because they've now had my car for a week and the mechanic tells me that it was the motor mounts, duh, and that they had them fixed 3 days ago! i took my car back and even though it still wasn't quite right i knew that this mechanic was completely incompetent so we just left knowing we would need to get it looked at by someone else. this takes me to today. last week after i filled my gas tank, i smelled gas and noticed that my tank had leaked. so i finally took it to another mechanic to have them look at that and the rough ride the car had. my fuel tank wasn't properly connected to the fuel pump which was the cause for the gas spilling out every time i drove it. which is another thing desert heat had replaced and couldn't seem to connect properly after replacing it! as for the rough ride, can you guess what that was? it was the motor mounts!! i need new motor mounts! the motor mounts that were used were so cheap they had already broken! i'm so beyond pissed right now at this mechanic i'm having a hard time containing myself. i'm now out an extra $600 to get the work done properly, not to mention the overpriced amount i probably paid to desert heat. whoever bought this business has no clue what they're doing to cars and are causing more damage in the process!"
4-star,1,"i became a desert heat fan several years ago when kevin and kurt helped me solve a problem while i was at a neighboring business and they didn't even charge me. i have used them for almost all of our auto repairs and maintenance and have always been very satisfied with the quality of work and the reasonable prices. however today i came in and didn't recognize anyone there. everyone seemed friendly enough so i didn't have any concerns. i was told the driver side door latch needed to be maintained not replaced and the driver side electric window motor was dead. i was charged $238.00 total when the part itself costs between $37.00 (carid.com) and $53.00 (amazon.com). this means i was charged between $201.00 and $185.00 to remove the door panel, grease the lock and install the window motor. i have removed door panels before which takes between 10-20 minutes tops. i have never installed a window motor, but i expect it to be a 30 minute job with another 10-20 minutes to grease the lock and put the door panel back on. i think a more fair and reasonable price would have been closer to $150.00 rather than almost $250.00. none of this is really a catastrophe, but i didn't appreciate my car smelling like a tobacco factory caught on fire when i picked it up. i refuse to give them a 2-3 star rating simply because this could be an anomaly and if kevin and kurt are still involved i am willing to give the place another chance. it is extremely difficult to find good, honest and affordable mechanics and i hope i won't have to go on the hunt again. sorry i missed you kevin and kurt!"
5-star,1,"i've known these guys for several years now and have been able to send them quite a bit of business. it's been great to have such an honest mechanic i can trust. i have had them do everything from transmissions to oil changes and everything in between. their prices are fair, but more importantly you can trust them. i wouldn't hesitate to refer them to any of my friends and family."

(i was having the title transferred on my car) she returned within a couple of hours with my new license plates and registration. i babysit my granddaughter during the week, and i didn't have to drag a toddler to the dmv!!! so easy and convenient!"
5-star,1,kristie is amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! she went over and above what i paid her to do. i highly recommend her to anybody that needs to have their vehicle registered.
5-star,1,"kristie is the beyond the best! my life can be very chaotic, and there isn't a lot of free time for me to get certain errands accomplished. thankfully a friend mentioned done & done dmv services to me, so i thought i would give them a try. all i can say is wow....that was the best move i ever made!!! kristie is such an sweet & amazing woman. she was super thorough getting my car registered, and obtaining all the required documentation i needed for personal reasons, as well as business reasons. kristie saved the day! not only with her wonderful personality, but also with her ability to expedite & obtain the proper documentation, but also her extreme attention to detail was superb, and her fee goes beyond the word fair! from now till the day i die, i will always use done & done dmv services!"
5-star,1,"kristie was very professional, came at the exact times she said she would, reasonable on her price, and very knowledgeable of the paperwork required. she saved me from wasting one of my valuable days off at the dmv, and got the transaction and documents back to me 24 hours ahead of schedule! i would use done and done again, and highly recommend them."
1-star,0,"kristie baldasarre picked up the docs for a same day vehicle registration at 2p wed. she stated that if she couldn't get it done that day, it would be done the following day, thurs. at 5:30p thursday, after receiving no communication from kristie she claimed that she was too busy with her work the casino to do the job to which she'd agreed. then, when asked for the documents back (to hire a reliable service provider) she refused to release/return the paperwork until 12p. the next day (friday), as if she hadn't already wasted an entire day! how is this service worth any rating?"
5-star,1,"needed to get my new travel trailer registered quick. i tried calling the dmv to figure out exactly what documents i would need but they were no help. the deadline was coming up in a few days and i had no free time. instead of trying to figure it out myself, i called the dmv vixen to just get it done and over with. getting a hold of her was easy. just shot her a text. within a few hours of getting a hold of her she had already come to my work office and picked up the necessary documents after telling me exactly what i'd need. the next morning she sends me a message saying that the trailer was registered and that she'd be dropping the new license plates off in a few hours. few hours later she comes to my office again and drops off the plates. quick and efficient. if you need to get something done at the dmv and don't have the time to go, try giving her a call. her rates were affordable compared to some of the other companies i checked and her customer service was great."
5-star,1,"needed a fast hop to register my daughters car in a jiffy. i was in town on biz. absolutely no fucking energy to deal with dmv denziens. christie had plates to me before lunch. great woman, fast and honest service. 5 stars. calling number a217 expedience can be a premium? calling number b12 absolutely 5 stars!"
5-star,1,you know i have used done and done at least 6 times now i've also referred everybody i know kristy works really hard she gets it done sends confirmations always returns phone calls if she can't get to it right then she can get to it tomorrow if you're in a hurry she'll make the extra effort to make sure it gets done always has a great attitude no wonder her business is thriving! thank you for everything!
1-star,0,i have tried to contact them many times in the past 3 days and haven't gotten a single call back or anything. i would not recommend these people.
5-star,1,done and done. just as advertised. she picks up the paperwork and gets the car registered then gets it back to you. well worth the money. no headache. if you wanna get it done she will get it done.
5-star,1,"kristie is way beyond helpful; i had a very complicated situation bringing a car from out of state, trying to juggle medical treatments, etc. i was physically unable to handle the paperwork or being in lines at dmv. let me just say ""kristie handled it all"". i am extremely grateful for her speed, accuracy, attention to detail, and caring heart. thank you from the bottom of my heart."
5-star,1,"first off kristie is out of this world! very professional, sense of urgency, and will get the job done for you. she probably knows more then the people that actually work at the dmv. i was in a nightmare with a car i purchased 4 months ago and having been having title problems since then. just as i was to give up a friend gave me her info. within 1 week she was able to tell where the errors were. i've been going back and forth to the dmv for answers that they had no info on my car for over 3 months and she found it in 1 week. yes one week! give her time to help you with the services you need done. patience is the key word. she goes the extra mile for her clients. her rates are very reasonable. i wish i could give her 10 stars. trust her, trust her service, if she can't get it done, i honestly think no one can. thank you kristie for your hard work and dedication in helping people like myself."
5-star,1,"this is an awesome service! kristie is wonderful! she will answer any questions you have and get you all taken care of at the dmv. if you don't have time to go to the dmv, use kristie! leave a message on her phone and she will call you back and make your day!"
5-star,1,"if you need help with registering a vehicle, this young lady may be able to help you. she is mobile so when you call you will have to leave your info and she will call you back. she is very friendly and does not leave you hanging. if you do not like standing in line at the dmv and you don't mind paying a fee, this is the way to go.."
5-star,1,"absolutely the best experience i've ever had with anything related to dmv. kristie is on-the-spot and does the job right and very quickly. i had a rush because my vehicle was being repaired; three days from the due-date, kristie handled everything on friday, including coming back and handing me the new plates, all in the same day. never again, if i can help it, will i go back to the dmv. thank you kristie, well done."
5-star,1,"kristie is awesome! everyone dreads going to the dmv. done and done is the answer. she's got the hookup at dmv. courteous, friendly and reasonably priced. saves you hours at dmv. fast turnaround. i met with her yesterday and got my license plates in 1 day. my girlfriend will have her car registered in 1 day as well tomorrow. it's nice not having to wait for 6 weeks for license plates like you do in cali. definitely recommend done and done dmv services. you won't be disappointed mahalo kristie"
5-star,1,"if you don't have time to go to t he dmv, call this number. kristie is a wonderful person and will save you tons of time! her service are very afford and she will be able to do almost whatever you need on the spot with results as soon as the next day! she's very pleasant to work with and will make life for you and anyone else much easier and not to mention, she's certified with what she does. :d i will definitely recommend her to friends who rather not die of boredom at the dmv."
5-star,1,kristie has helped me so much on several occasions for dealing with the dmv. this service is a life saver. she's always gone way above and beyond on anything i would expect. she's extremely professional and incredibly courteous. i always recommend done and done to anyone who has any issues with the dmv. i'll be a lifetime customer. simply the best!
5-star,1,"every time we need her she's there, courteous and get's the job done with no hassle. prices are very fair too! highly recommend her! don't even think twice. life is too short to waste at the dmv!"
5-star,1,"super fast and professional help ! cause no one wakes up as says "" man ! ... i'd really like to spend 1/2 a day at the dmv today "" give them a call - you'll be happy you did . they get it done & done . thank you !!!"
5-star,1,"i had to get a salvage vehicle registered and had to go back and forth to the dmv because i kept on getting different information from the employees there. when an emergency came up and i had to leave the country, i didn't know what to do. that's when i found kristie on yelp and after reading so many positive reviews i decided to contact her. she responded to my email right away and soon as i got back into town she was ready to help me out. what i couldn't get done in a few days, she got done for me in one morning. i highly recommend this business for efficiency, great service and best of all not over priced for all that they do. thank you again kristie if you happen to see this review. you are the best!!!"
5-star,1,my goodness the horror of getting my car through smog. thank god for kristie of done and done. she did all the dmv leg work to keep the moving permit up to date. i did get my car to pass but i save days by not having to go to the dmv a half a dozen times. kristie you are danny vegas approved
5-star,1,"i am so happy to have found kristie on yelp! she is very professional and efficient. her service fee is very reasonable too. i needed to get my car registered and like everybody else, i was dreading to go to dmv and wait all day. i called her and left her a voice message and after couple minutes i got a call back from her. i did the pick up and delivery service. my car was registered in less than 24hours w/o having to wait at the dmv!!! i am so pleased doing business with her! money well spent. i would highly recommend her."
5-star,1,kristie is truly the greatest dmv vixson on the planet. fantastic communication skills! her attitude along with her professionalism made me forget i was speaking with a dmv employee. i would recommend her to all friends and family. truly was a pleasure. thank you so much and have a wonderful new year!
5-star,1,"amazing!!! extremely friendly & courteous. calls 10-15 prior to arrival. fantastic attitude, tells you how long it will take and approximately how much it will be upfront. made what would have been at least 3 hours of painstaking time with our 15 month old @ the dmv into 2 less than 15 minute meetings. if efficiency is what you're lookin' for you can't go wrong."
5-star,1,"kristie is such a wonderful person and has helped me with my insurance in the past, so now she can handle my dmv services along with notary. she is mobile so she comes to you which makes things so easy. she always has a smile on her face and is very professional, so you know she gets the job done right, with accurate and quick turn around. i highly recommend her!"
5-star,1,"kristie is quick, professional and will take care of all your dmv needs that she can. and she will come to you to do it. she was able to take care of my specific needs as well as my friends all in one swoop. i'd recommend her to anyone who hates waiting in lines and wants their dmv needs to get done and done!!!"
5-star,1,"kirstie is great -- a real hard worker who goes the extra mile to help you with all your dmv issues without any kind of hard sell. i had some issues dmv related issues to deal with that i didn't have time or answers for and kirstie was great to have in my corner for advice and document services. she followed up several times afterwards to make sure everything was going well and even offered to help out with another issue. kirstie is also mobile so will come to you or meet you somewhere convenient. if you need a simple, effective way of dealing with dmv admin, kirstie is your new best friend."
5-star,1,"awesome awesome awesome!!! i just moved to las vegas and i was yelping dmvs in the area. i then came across this service option. i gave kristie a call originally to ask her about my late registration from connecticut, she not only gave me the information i needed, but she also made sure to direct me to the right place to get the information she was unsure of. i called back a second time to ask for her business. why would i go wait in line forever at the dmv when i have the choice not to? :) what i really appreciated was how she didn't push her business on me. she sold me with her professionalism, knowledge of the dmv policies and willingness to just help. done and done was created for all the times you've ever wished you had a personal assistant just for the dmv. i never even knew that i had a choice to wait or not to wait. glad i do now."
5-star,1,kristie came all the way to henderson to meet me for one signature i needed notarized took care of business done and done! thanks kristie your the best.
1-star,0,"here's my nightmare. i'm on my third vehicle after the first two had major mechanical issues. returned both of them now the third vehicle is being picked up from the repair shop as i type this since the claim for serious issues that had to present when the vehicle was sold was denied by silver rock warranty. first fuel pump 6 days after this one, then break issues within a month, now fuel injection and spark plug problems, etc. costing me $50 for a diagnostic when i could have took this lemon to my own mechanic for it for free. might add all this has taken place in less than four months. i'm not the only customer being robbed with shady practices. but i know once this gets out others will come forward and as with all other companies before truths will be revealed. starting with denying claims on vehicles with potentially death causing issues on a car customers took possession of within days. also all fluids in this 2014 nissan altima purchased with 39k miles are dark and dirty making me question about this so called multi point inspection. three cars off the same lot with major issues within two weeks."
1-star,0,"found a car on autotrader, made an appointment to see it. he begun by viewing my us income info. i have 680 credit score at the moment. for some strange reason that we sincerely dont understand, the seller all of a sudden said ""this is one of our speciality vehicles so we can only finance it if you have $4000 monthly us income or more"" (he already knew my us income is just below that). when asked what a speciality vehicle was, they responded ""more equipment and has a 7 in the number"". so driving all the way out to the east lv ghettos was a waste of our time. so dont believe their statement ""we work with all types of credit"". they are liars pure and simple. my home is paid off and i have $60000 worldwide income but i am still not good enough for drivetime."
5-star,1,"so if i read the yelp reviews prior to coming in, i might not have decided to get my car from here. i came to drive time after going to a few other dealerships like toyota, nissan and carmax but due to some credit issues, they offered my extremely high interest on used cars with payments close to $500. drive time was my last resort before i gave up on getting a car. i came in on friday afternoon just to look around and see what my options were. i ended up working with toby and he was professional, patient and answered all questions i had. i told him i prefer a honda civic or maybe a vw jetta. i have had two other honda civics and they are truly safe and reliable cars. i was shown a cute acura but it had leather seats and it was very hot that day so sitting inside the car let me know, leather seats are not for me. the second car he shown me was a 2016 honda civic ex. the car was exactly what i wanted! it comes with more than what i thought i wanted and also the payment was much smaller than anything i was offered at other dealerships. also, my interest rate offered by drive time was almost 10% lower than other offers. the problem with the other dealer offers was that the car they told me i could get was not worth the high payment they wanted. the civic i purchased from drive time a few days ago has remote start and that alone sold me because being pregnant in this summer heat, being able to cool my car before getting in it is a true benefit. i mean, i have had no problems with my car so far and it drives very smooth and was not high mileage, 30,560 was what the odometer read. i personally am glad i gave this place a try and have told a few people i know about it. also, yes i did put money down. i was approved for a $400 down payment but since i wanted lower monthly payments and i was getting a settlement from a car accident in my 2006 civic hybrid, i decided to be much more down. all in all, i had a good experience. probably the least stressful car buying experience i have ever had buying a car. toby did not hassle me or push me toward buying anything. he was accommodating and helped me get a deal that was in my price range."
2-star,0,"they have a very large selection of used cars for sale. i've known many people over the years that financed a car from them. they really will approve anyone like they advertise however, i was way better off going down the street to a smaller buy here pay here lot. when they ran my credit they wanted $5k down lol. the real dealership, such as friendly ford offered me a brand new ford for $4k down. not to mention $5k will buy you half the cars on drive time's lot outright if they were being sold by a private party. their interest rates are through the roof. i would have to advise everyone to weigh out all their other options first, and only go here as a last resort."
1-star,0,i would not recommend anyone to drivetime. their vehicles have high miles and are in extremely bad condition. do not let the outside appearance fool you. you will begin to have problems almost immediately or after your warranty expires. if they send you to one of their vendors watch out aamco does not do a proper repair and their parts are defective. drivetime is not a second chance it is a death sentence.
1-star,0,save yourselves from a bad experiance with this company. i have had to deal with them since july of 2017. when i first took it to repair it they were nice but after that it went down hill. one thing after another. the warrenty wont cover but then it does. its just disgusting how they want you to waste more then what the car is actually worth. but yet they want you to keep making your payments on time. its terrible what they do and disgusting that they dont want to help. dont buy from dive time go to some one else. and denise from customer relations is a lair
1-star,0,"so our adventure started on october 20th of 2017, that's when we encountered the worst dealership in las vegas. she (my girl) purchased a 2012 chevy traverse, after 5 days the check engine light comes on, car is taken in and fixed, 2 days after she got it back the light comes on again and it has to be towed in again, in the shop for 4 days then last week on saturday it breaks down again, we contact bridgecrest/drivetime and they won't stand behind their vehicles, she calls to deferred one payment and they start making threatening calls to me. they claim no record of a payment arrangement being made at all which was garbage. i tried to warn her because where i work we have to deal with them and we know they are garbage, not only that nightmare, when drivetime purchased the vehicle from another dealership they paid 10,000 dollars but marked it up to 15,965 and after ridiculous finance charges to make this vehicle about 30,000 out the door with 98,000 miles on it, any used vehicle in the state of nevada by law over 75,000 miles they must make available the engine and drive train inspection which they did not. so basically horrible sales staff horrible customer service reps, and if you give them a negative review on facebook they block you from the page."
1-star,0,"this is the second time i have had a bad experience with drive time. the first time the car was inoperable within 60 days of purchase due to motor mounts that were not covered under the warranty. so i lost out on my down payment and vehicle. this time one week after obtaining the car i found out the rim was damaged and causing the tire to loose presure rapidly. i could have lost my life driving both faulty vehicles. i understand these are used cars, but these issues are life threatning. i stronlgy caution anyone when purchasing a vehicle from drive time! an the intrest is absurb."
5-star,1,i had a great experience with drivetime. i was greeted by elena when i came in. i had a appointment with araceli gotes. we were able to test drive quite a few cars to see what worked for my wife and i. she was patient and transparent with how much we needed for a down payment and the monthly payments. she looked out for best interest and were able to get a hyundai sonata that was affordable. we were able to get everything done in under 3 hours. if you have challenged credit this dealership is worth checking out. the lower the mileage on the car the better off you are. you are also given a autocheck report where you can see the history of the vehicle.
5-star,1,"i was a little hesitate about going to another ""drive here, pay here"" place, but when i first walked in and saw the openness of the office. elena f, was originally at the decatur office, but recently moved to this location. she has been exceptionally great in our car purchase and worked with us for a few months to get some issues taken care but, she kept in touch and was happy to work with us. we transferred to this location because of her, and we will continue to go here and refer clients to her for their car needs, everything so far has been smooth and great with their transactions. they also have a wide range of selection of cars and good prices!"
5-star,1,"i just wanted to day elena is the best, she went above and beyond to help us get the car we wanted! it took a few to get but we did it and were happy! she is the best! i will recommend her to all my friends!"
1-star,0,"first and last time we will come here. lori told us to come on up to see a truck that we saw on their site. when we get here, she tells us that it is in the shop being worked on.. and that we couldn't go back to see it. even to see that it exists!!? pretty sure it was sold and their way of getting us here. nope.. never again."
1-star,0,"avoid like the plague! i purchased a vehicle from drivetime about 3 months ago. before we purchased we asked if there were any problems with the vehichle. we asked if there were any recalls. the lady who sold us our car told us no. not even two weeks after we bought the car we were having problems with the car driving terribly. thank goodness we bought an extended warranty because in less than 60 days our engine light came on and now the engine is being replaced. the air bag light is on because it was wired wrong. who would have thought that a 2015 vehicle would already need a new engine. the extended warranty saved my pockets. long and short, the sales people were not honest about the true condition of the car. secondly the car we originally wanted they would not sell to us even though it was on the lot because one of the workers wanted to buy it. not that they had already purchased it but because they wanted to therefore we end up with a crappy car. also keep in mind if you do buy from here everything is "" as is"". we asked what happened to our car mats and they told us they were in the truck. we looked in the trunk no car mats. we let them know there were no car mats and their exact words were sorry you bought it as is. you have 30 days from the time you purchase to take a vehichle back to the lot if you are unhappy with it. really pay attention to your vehicle in the first two weeks that you buy it so you can take it back if it's not working out for you well. after that you're at the mercy of auto shops and if you're smart an extended warranty. i really hope this helps somebody. if it does all the better!"
1-star,0,never ever buy a car from this company they don't report to the credit bureau if you paid off a car and they fight with you over the phone. all cars have very high mileage warranty sucks
1-star,0,"do yourself a favor and do not give drivetime your number. after i did some digging and found out about the shady business practices, i decided to stay far, far away from the company. unfortunately, by that point, the company already had my number, and lisa at this location has been calling my phone each day for over a month. you'd think at some point she would take a hint, but obviously not."
5-star,1,great friendly people. fast comprehensive buying experience. knowledgeable and personable staff that actually follow up with you to ensure you had a great experience. awesome!!! i'd recommend to anyone looking to buy a reliable car.
1-star,0,"we bought a car there four years ago and they blew through the paperwork and we signed up. we are going to pay the full value of a new explorer instead of one with 100k on it. my wife did have challenges on her credit, but they too advantage of her on a big way. her challenge was due to a credit repair company shenanigans. don't ever buy from drive time. we are almost done with them and they are trying to trick her into buying again. with 700 + credit scores now, we don't think we will be doing business with them again. don't shop here. they are predators. they suck."
5-star,1,aszia was such a great help and was very easy to work with. it was an all day process but worth it. she went above and beyond to help me get into the car i was needing and i appreciate her. she even did a great job dealing with my step dad lol. thank you aszia wilson and drivetime team for your help!!
1-star,0,this is my third car with drivetime. why is it my third? every car i've have from them was terrible so i traded them in within the 5 days. now not to mention i am 6 months pregnant so i really need to get around. when i first got the 3rd car ivan the store mananger promised me all kinds of things that would be fixed through warranty. i called warranty because every time i came outside to go to work my tires were flat. yes flat!! so the warranty says okay they will approve it even though it's something they usually don't. okay good so i call the warranty and they say they are waiting for drive time a customer relations to approve my tires. i call customer relations which is horrible!!! and they say nope we aren't fixing anything literally that's what the man says. now my tired are only okay if i put fix a flat in them which is not a good thing. remember i'm pregnant right? so my tired could just fall off at anythime. i don't think its fair and i don't think i should have to replace the tires of i've been told they would be approved because i've had solo many issues. smh. i have called the better business beraue and a lawyer to handle it because its been that bad. i would never recommend going here ever to anyone. i'm going to let everyone i know not to go there.
5-star,1,"just remember: it's a used car dealer who deals in helping people w poor credit get a car. it is what it is. don't expect a benz when you can't afford one. that being said: this drivetime dealer has been nothing but wonderful to me for well over a year. they were there to help me get a car for work and life when no one else would, and they never made me feel guilty about it. the moment i walked in, i knew i was welcome. it took about 2 whole minutes on a busy afternoon to get one on one service. they supplied computers and printers to get all the paperwork going (pay stubs, credit reports, bank statements, etc), and were very patient w me as a fairly inexperienced car buyer. they were informative as well, and walked me through both the purchasing program and the cancel anytime lease program. transparency was apparent. i chose the lease, and was lucky enough to find multiple cars on the lot, which is quite large, that i was qualified for. the finance process was simple and took about an hour to complete. i met joe there, and he was awesome. he made me feel like family, and was very straight forward about the finance terms and the pro's and con's of the two options. he also helped me to understand how to earn credit toward future down payments w the purchase program by using auto-pay, and helped me get set up with new car insurance. i made payments on the car for about 14 months, and was just recently able to improve my credit to a place where i could qualify for a loan and buy a new car from hyundai. that is the one and only reason i did not return to drivetime to buy... i chose new over used of course. when i returned the vehicle joe was there again, and made that process very easy, too. quick and painless. all of the team members who've helped me for the past year were fantastic. the phone line for info is always quick, and getting help to get approved for some light maintenance (brakes and oil changes) was very easy w the phone operators and sears team. they have a program that automates the whole thing. they text me to remind me of an upcoming payment, and the one and only time i needed an extra couple days, they obliged. i have and would again recommend this drivetime to friends and family who need help getting a good used car on less than perfect credit. the team there deserves a pat on the back and a genuine thank you from me, as genuine as theirs felt a year ago when they got me off the bus and onto the road again. thank you."
1-star,0,i didn't even want to give it one star truly the worst customer service. they really don't care about people and all there cars are crap. dont buy from here!!
1-star,0,truly the worst experience i have ever encountered at a car dealership. kept giving me same excuse day after day that they were waiting on a reply from the bank. i was trying to get a car with my boyfriend but then they said something was wrong with his social security card which there isn't. now all the money that i gave as down payment paid in cash they can only return to me in the form of a check. so now i am out my money and a car. should have just told us this from the beginning i would have never used this place ever.

1-star,0,"we bought our vehicle from drive time on sahara in march '08 chrysler town & country with all the bells and whistles. we drove it off the lot and on our way home the check engine light came on, took it over to ted wiens/firestone to find that there was a massive oil leak, didn't have it for a week. following that there has been nothing but problems with it. the radiator is bad but is ""covered"" under warranty so they said it was denied. the caliper in the rear brakes locked up while i was drive and was towed not once but twice. it needs new motor mounts because they are cracked i went over to drive-time advising them of these issues and was told by a ""manager/salesperson nathan"" when asked why this wasn't fixed when it went through their ""inspection"" prior to putting this vehicle on the lot. his quote was ""those are human beings back there and make mistakes"" wtf .. pretty big mistake. he said it is cheaper for ted wiens to fix the problems then for drive-time too. there customer service sucks i was on hold for 1.5 hours today. you want good business you go out of your way to make your customers happy especially when you bought a vehicle for $15k. i told this person i will never ever buy another car from them i have nothing good to say (except for eric he was very helpful from the get go) i told nathan (mgr) i have been in this town since 1981 hubby born and raised i know a lot of people. after leaving those yoyo's we called our warranty company averex who told us the radiator was covered. went back to ted wiens/firestone after being on hold for 45 mins the radiator and only the radiator will be fixed. rear calipers. motor mounts and thermostat or the rack & pinion will not be fixed. i am still not able to drive this vehicle in the 3 months we have owned this vehicle i have only been able to enjoy it for a month. i have a '97 toyota tacoma & '02 toyota sienna with nothing wrong with them. we thought we would buy a newer vehicle to enjoy, it has only been a nightmare."
4-star,1,"drivetime makes the used car/poor credit buying experience easy. 1) go online, look at cars, get approved for inhouse loan (everyone gets approved, the amount varies based upon your provable income) 2) get a call from the dealer or set an appointment at one of the two lots in las vegas. 3) go to your appointment, pay $1000 down (or more, but 1k is the minimum), leave with vehicle. the good news is that once you are approved, so long as your references and job verification check out, you won't be denied so you don't have to go through hours of paperwork after finding your car to find out you can't get financed. joe was an excellent sales rep. they do not negotiate the price so there is no hard sell. he was very informative about the processes, even refusing to show me a car because when he looked at it he didn't feel it was ready to be seen. they offer you water and popcorn while you wait. their cars are all on the lot and they will take you out on a test drive in as many as you want. all the cars we looked at were in good condition, clean, and started up immediately with a good sounding engine. i found the vehicle i wanted. now comes the reason this place doesn't have 5 stars. the paperwork took a ridiculously long time to prepare. i literally sat chatting with joe for almost 2 hours while they apparently retyped everything that had been entered when i applied into a different system. they assured me they are getting new systems soon but still you need to know that when you do the purchase, you will need to be there for a while, or go have lunch and come back. the other thing to be aware of, although it is not a complaint, and i do not feel that joe or the business tried to hide anything from me. in fact, when i inquired, they were very friendly and open about it. however, you need to know the payment quote will include a powertrain warranty and a vehicle locator system totaling about 3k. while these are optional, the payment quote included them and only when i asked was i told they were optional. don't misunderstand me, they didn't hide it from me nor did they try to make me keep it when i inquired, but they just didn't tell me they were included on the estimate. moral is, read the estimate first before you commit to the deal and don't be afraid to ask questions. your payments will be biweekly and they do have a gps locator and kill switch if you don't make your payments timely. other than that, the experience was great and i walked away with a car i am very happy with. if you have difficult credit, this is a great place to go."
5-star,1,"the experience i had at drivetime was awesome. i talked to joe on the phone with lots of questions, and he didn't hesistate to answer any of them. he booked me an appointment the following day. when i arrived i was greeted by glenn who took care of us so that we wouldn't need to wait. we looked at only the cars i wanted to look at and he never pressured me into getting anything else. i ended up getting a beautiful 2012 dodge avenger, it was literally an in and out process. they really work with you when it comes to a down payment (you have 60 days to come in and put more towards a down payment to lower your monthly bill). joe had told me that they do not work off commission, so you really have no pressure to buy anything then and there. they keep your possible loan open for 40 days, so you have time to think. also, if you refer anyone to buy a car from them you get credit towards your loan. it was overall the best experience at a car dealership i've ever had!"

1-star,0,"this is gonna be a long one, but it will be worth your time if u r planning to take it to this shop. i gave it 1 star cause 0 or minus stars is not optional.stay away from this place as far away as you possibly can. see my photographs! i truly believe that every day they pick up mexicans standing by the home depot to paint their cars. my first contact was with one of the two guys running the shop, i believe it was the manager, and he gave me an estimate of $500 to paint my hood, front bumper, and blend in the side panels. it is common sense to do the panels when you paint hood/bumper. they were not planning on removing the bumper to paint it. again, common sense prevails, in order to get it done right is to remove the bumper so that the paint don't chip/crack from the edges. i told him to remove the bumper, and i was willing to pay extra just to get it done right, and they charged me little more, but i was good with that as long as they do the job right. i left my car for about a week, and when i picked it up the bumper had smudges on it, and was cracking on the edges. they did not blend in the side panel, and you could tell the color did not match the hood, and bumper. they never removed the bumper completely, they removed it partially by ripping it off the screw/clips, which caused additional damage to the plastic radiator core inside of the hood above the bumper, which is attached to the hood-prop-rod. they just left the plastic broken, and the attached hood-prop-rod completely detached from the radiator core. believe it or not they just shoved the hood-prop-rod (not attached to anything) in between the bumper, and radiator. to replace the part it cost me $450, not including labor. when they removed the bumper they broke the holes for the screws/clips on the side of the bumper, which are now missing, and the bumper wasn't perfectly aligned with the side panels. they never attached the grill on top of the bumper, and just left with only the top part attached to the broken radiator core. they didn't cover the carpet inside of the vehicle, and left paint on from stepping on it. i thought i was on a hidden camera show, and thought that this was a joke. i was just waiting for someone to come out and tell me that this was a joke. i complained about it to the manager guy that gave me an estimate, and to another guy that's possibly the owner. i told them about the issue, and especially pointed out the damage, and told him that the side panels have not been blended in. even though the owner wasn't present during the original estimate he told me we didn't think i wanted the panels done. i can't emphasize enough how many times i told them what i needed done, done right, plus it's common sense every professional shop will tell you that the side panels always need to be blended in, or otherwise the paint job will not look right. he told me that its common for the radiator core and the hood-prop-rod to break because it's common on these cars, a 2014 vw jetta. he blamed it on the manufacturer lol. ok, i get it, even if! you f...... broke it, not me. it broke while it was in your possession. i felt like i was talking to 2 idiots. u should know this as someone that claims is running a professional paint shop. again, i didn't make a scene because they offered to fix it, but told me that i would have to pay additional $200 for the side panels cause they never included it in the estimate. lie! i just wanted to get it done, and left the vehicle for another week. i just wanted to get it over with, and never return to this place again. the owner guy told me this time he will paint it, and get it don't right. i picked it up the next week, and guess what? few days later a piece of paint from the hood came off. i wasted so much time, money fixing the broken parts, and other small stuff that it would have been cheaper for me to just take it to a real professional body shop to get it done right. lesson learned. if it's a cheap paint job it's most likely going to be a shitty job. please check out the pictures i attached to see the damage they caused. now my bumper is barely hanging on to the front, and i had to use zip ties to keep it from falling off since all the hardware/screw/clips are missing."
5-star,1,"i love how my car turned out! plus everyone there is so nice, friendly and professional. my car's paint was peeling horribly. they told me it was a bad year for paint which made me feel better because i always thought it was something i did. tim said the hood was one of the worst he'd ever seen. i wasn't expecting much but when i picked it up (a day early!) i was amazed. it's beautiful! i'm not sure why i'm surprised - earl schieb has been around for years. if you want your car painted, don't hesitate to take it here!"
5-star,1,"first, in reality, i would probably give this place 4.5 stars, but since it is better than 4.0 stars, i am giving it 5. this is a review of a shop that is for someone more on a budget, and not necessarily asking for a barrett jackson show car level of a paint job, though they still do a good job. for most people, i think this earl scheib would be just fine. that said, when i was there i saw quite a few classic cars parked in their lot, waiting for a paint job, so i would have say enough people must think they do good enough job to feel comfortable enough to go there and have their mustangs and camaros painted there. now, for my experience. i picked up a used fiberglass camper shell for my truck, that had scuffed corners from being stored on end. the camper was dark gray, while my truck is white. i took it to earl scheib, and they painted it white for me, and the price came in at about $300. the good: 1. they were able to match the color white to my truck's factory white paint. you wouldn't have known the camper was gray. it is as white as my truck's factory paint is. there is no gray showing through the paint or any missed spots. you would think this camper was originally white to begin with. 2. they were fast, and had it done within a day. 3. i was on a budget, and couldn't afford to have the corners repaired with filler. the paint shop was able to spray it with a thick primer, and i think they even hit the corners a little extra to help fill in the damage on the corners. when i got it back, the corners looked almost like they had filled it with some body filler,a dn was very pleased with how they did that. i am convinced it would not have looked that much better with body filler. so this saved me almost a $100. 4. the guys at the shop were very courteous and helpful. and they even helped me put the camper on the back of my truck at no charge. some places charge for that. 5. after two years, the paint has not peeled or bubbled. it also came with a guarantee that if it ever did, they would reshoot it. 6. they taped off the windows and molding so there was no overspray on the glass or molding. what could have been better: 1. when i looked closer, it looks as though there are some air bubbles on the finish from back when the paint was still wet in some spots. they are very tiny and you have to look close to notice them. now, to be fair, it is possible if i had this camper wet sanded, or possibly even just cut and polished by a detail shop, these imperfections might be removed, or reduced. i may end up doing this, but these imperfections don't bother me that much. besides, for $300, i can't complain. there are some places that charge over $1000 to paint a camper shell. bottom line, i would recommend earl scheib. i am considering taking my car there to be painted."
1-star,0,"i almost got taken for as a fool buy this place. they tired to get away with not doing the work i actually paid for. i wanted touch up work and some panels repainted as in sanded, primed and painted but they just airbrushed the blemishes. they swore all i wanted was airbrushing touch ups yet they wanted to charge me over $300 for maybe an hours worth of work?? they also took longer than they said they would which was a hassle not having a vehicle for over 4 weeks after they finally did what i asked for but the paint is already starting to peel. *middle finger*"

5-star,1,"easily the best car buying experience i've had. my vehicle was in need of some work when i bought it (not the dealers fault). everything was noted and after a week i brought the vehicle back for the required work. while dropping off the vehicle, i showed the manager several other items that i noticed in the first week of ownership and he assured me everything would be taken care of. i received an excellent courtesy vehicle for the entire duration and when my car was ready, they drove it to me and took the their courtesy vehicle back, saving me a trip. while they had my car i received regular updates without fail and all work was completed a day early and to very high quality. at every turn i was treated like a lifetime customer even though it was my first purchase with them. i will recommend this dealership to anyone looking to purchase a vehicle and will most likely be making additional purchases here in the future. thank you for customer service that is rare these days!"

2-star,0,"just not my favorite dealership for service. it is privately owned, so if you are getting a repair completed that is covered by ford and get a rental, then you pay the tax and any fees associated. other than that, i did not find the service manager to be pleasant. rushed when addressing my concerns, did not take the time to explain the issues with my car (recall for a broken door latch), and did not explain the other necessary repairs. compared to the service i received in scottsdale, this was terrible. also, did a poor job on the cleaning at the end, the staff was not friendly either."

1-star,0,"recently purchased a new mustang convertible, waited two months for it to become available. the internet salesmen was very helpful but then when it started getting to closing time they rushed us to run our credit and agree to a payment plan without negotiating. we knew we wanted the vehicle but they already started taking the license plate off of our trade-in and working all the paperwork before we officially agreed to purchase the vehicle. once in the finance office, i finally told them to stop and looked over all the issues. after going through multiple managers and more additional wait time they finished up all our paperwork. the frustrating part was the final delivery when they rushed us out and i noticed issues with weatherstripping faded and worn and then a few days later the convertible motor would jerk and the rear view camera would go out intermittently. i scheduled an appointment with a service advisor over the phone and told them the issues. once i arrived, the service advisor was on vacation and told us we would talk to another person. they then proceed to listen to our whole entire story and wonder why delivery did this even though the vehicle was purchased only 2 weeks ago. frustrating part #2, they also sent us away because they didn't have any technicians to work on this even though we scheduled an appointment. they took in too many vehicles that did not have appointments and they were not sure if the part was in for the weatherstripping and how long it would take to fix. they also didn't bother to look at the convertible top or camera. they proceed on taking another appointment later on for which we did not have time to commit and no guarantee on how long the fix was going to be or when the part would be in. once i get these issues handled with from this dealership we brought the vehicle from, we will not ever bring it back here period."
5-star,1,i walked into earnhardt ford and was fortunate enought to run into brian burton. we were treated to a professional hassle free buying experience. we explored all options and bought the right truck at the right price with zero pressure. best dealership experience we have ever had.
1-star,0,"this dealer actually recommend i buy a new car from them and then let my current car get repossessed. i went in to this dealer to buy a new car and replace my current car. the sales manager said i was in too much negative equity on my current car. the car in question was 4000 upside down, they just wanted to make my payment look nice on paper. after they showed me a monthly payment they informed me that it wasn't taking my old car but letting it get repossessed after i bought a car from them. it's funny larry miller was able to take the car in trade and not try anything shady. stay far away from this place they will suggest you do outright stupid things for your credit just to get a sale."
1-star,0,"i regretfully must inform you that after two times of screwing up my oil changes, i will not be coming back to this quick lane place of business. after confronting them that they did not complete the job this 2nd time, and them saying i can't prove it, besides what my family mechanic showed me (old, low oil just weeks after i had it changed here), the manager, josh, wouldn't even bother to give me my money back. save yourself the headache, try your oil changes somewhere else!"
5-star,1,"my trusted place to take my 2006 mustang always feel vip treatment. transportation is provided, professional, and they stand behind all there work. i did have a problem with the work on some repairs, the shocks weren't put on but the manager sold them at cost. i had my husband install them. but i did have many other simple repairs needed. this was perfect. so i feel if you have a problem give people a chance to make it right first. if so i understand we all can make a mistake. i"
1-star,0,"i ordered a $50k truck from these guys and lied about the delivery date three times. it is now over 2 weeks late and the salesman, wont even return my call. stay away from these guys...they really just dont care! retraction: i originally stated that my truck was almost 2 months late. what i meant to say is that i been waiting for my truck for almost 2 months. i was originally told that it would be here the week of the 7th. then i was told it would be here on the 22. on the 22nd i was told it would be here on the 30th. now im told that the 30th is no guarantee. am i upsets...absolutely and i have every right to be. fortunately, they still have an opportunity to turn an unhappy customer into a satisfied one. i would love to be proven wrong and discover that they really do care. at this point it can go either way. as always ill be sure to keep all of you all posted."
4-star,1,"the best car buying experience ever! ask for laurie m. she was knowledgeable, not pushy and worked a great deal for us. juan in finance was also super! everyone we met was great. only draw back was being accosted at an entrance gate by sales reps. get past them and get to laurie and you'll leave very happy!! we'll be customers of hers and earnhardt as long as we are in az"
1-star,0,"i came with cash and it took them almost four hours to sell me a car. once that was done they tried to sell me undercoating and then harassed me via telephone, mail and email to fill out surveys."
5-star,1,very friendly and honest owner. he's up front with what prices start at but it all depends on the customer's wants. it may not be cheap but the quality is above and beyond other detailing businesses i've been to. it's also a bonus he comes to you. i had him shampoo and clean the interior thouroughly. i'll definitely call back to try more of his many services available.
4-star,1,no doubt! the job is well done but the prize is pricey compare to other places. i checked the prizes after i got the service. alfred is a nice guy but like i said after i checked the prize its pricey.
1-star,0,"this is after my first review: i had to buy the missing part at the dealership. it's $35 and i had to tear the carpet to get to the base underneath. so, $150 for just cleaning the area under driver's seat. what a scam!!!"
5-star,1,"what should i say about a guy who come to your address and do this excellent jod to your car, just look this beautiful change!"
5-star,1,"i called alfred, after reading the numerous 5 star ratings on yelp, to detail our security vehicles. he called me back within the hour to set up an appointment to come to my facility and assess the vehicles. his proposal was based on what i wanted the final outcome to be. i asked him to completely detail the interiors, remove window decals and wash the exterior. i opted not to have the engine cleaned. due to the heavy soil in the interiors from years of neglect and the sun baked window decals, the job was quoted at $350 for each. when negotiating price of detailing services, you must consider that alfred comes to your location, and that's a big plus! he's licensed, bonded and insured, so no worries when he's handling your property. he got to work right away and the pictures say 1,000 words. there was no spot missed on the interiors and the exterior came out just as he had promised. we are totally satisfied with his work. we have agreed to continue to use his service for maintenance wash on a weekly basis. another plus is that he accepts credit cards and is not a cash only business."
5-star,1,"i just bought a suv at the auto auction & the interior was as dirty as any car i've ever seen! it was disgusting! all the seats were covered in a white crusty, something. i'm sure everyone in vegas knows what a dark t-shirt looks like after someone has worked & sweated in it all day with the dried salt marks. that's exactly what this car was like. the person who drove it before was an absolute pig! there was sticky brown stuff all over the console, carpets were black, even they roof had black marks on it. if it hadn't been such a good deal, i'd never have touched it. this gentleman worked on my vehicle for over 4 hours & it is beautiful! it looks almost brand new. i can't really express how impressed i am! i'd spoken to many companies about it & he was the only who came to look before quoting me a price. one guy told me it's the fabric ford used & i'd probably just have to live with the white marks. most told me it couldn't be cleaned with a mobile unit. all said their online ""interior detail"" price didn't cover that. that is actually fair considering the description i gave though:) so he came, looked, quoted me, & guaranteed that if i wasn't satisfied i don't pay him. how could you get more fair than that?! i am more than satisfied. anyone looking for a true detail job, you've got to try this guy. he was amazing."
5-star,1,"very quick! i called and alfred came right away to detail my car which made it very convenient for me. very nice job, my car looks brand new!"
5-star,1,"i called after finding the business on yelp, and he came out within an hour. he came to my workplace and cleaned my vehicle in the parking lot (convenient). i was very specific that i wanted only the inside of my car cleaned--not the outside. i have little kids and the mess is on the inside, not the outside, and i hate spending the majority of the money for detailing on the outside of the vehicle. anyway, he was agreeable to this arrangement. he did the entire interior, plus vacuumed the kids' carseats as i asked. when i came back down to inspect it, i pointed out little areas i wanted gone over again, and he did them without pause. 10/10 would hire again!"
4-star,1,"he came out to do a basic cleaning of my daughter's car, which was tidy- nothing major to clean up. he was very convenient and offered to come out the next day. for a 2-door coupe he quoted $150-200 or $120 for no wax, no carpets. he did a good job- i'd recommend the service but the price was very high in my opinion."
5-star,1,this 5 star rated mobile detailer is no joke. it's 5 stars for a reason. the guy takes his time and treats your car with care. highly recommend for any looking for someone who does a great job and pays attention to every little detail. pricing is reasonable as well!
5-star,1,"alfred did a very good job cleaning my car. he was punctual and more importantly, efficient. like he says, he cleans every vehicle like his own. keep it up!"
5-star,1,this is the best car wash and detail i've ever had. he's in a mobile van and can come to your home or office. he really takes his time and ensures not one speck of dust or dirt is on your car. his prices are great and he is very thorough. best job in town. highly recommend!
5-star,1,"literally the best auto detailing, customer service i have ever experienced. these are the upmost professionals. if your looking for detailed, proffesional, long term auto work these are the guys and company you want. no if and or buts. worth it up and down. alfred and abraham top notch !"
5-star,1,"quick, professional and down-to-earth service. came over very quickly to give an estimate, recommendations for the future, and then got to work. no fuss, he knew what he was doing, and he demoed some higher services to give me a sense of what results possible with the vehicle. my mini countryman is sexy again!"
5-star,1,"this is my second time getting my car cleaned, he does a great job! fast and efficient, i'm really happy how it came out and the price is nice and reasonable."
5-star,1,i had an unfortunate incident in a coffee drive through on my way to work. i wanted to get the seats cleaned before the milk soaked in and went rancid. eco came to my office within an hour and shampooed the seats and carpet. he did an amazing job and my car had never been cleaner.
5-star,1,"great job. i have a 2004 infiniti g35 that while in good shape for its age was looking old and worn. when my wife surprised me by having my car detailed, i almost could not believe it was just cleaned and detailed. parts like my rear view mirrors which previously looked flat and dull now shine like new. thanks for taking the time to make my car turn heads again."
5-star,1,"amazing job!!! very friendly. had my scion xd cleaned yesterday (sunday). has almost any type of cleaning product you can think of ready to use in his van. washed (door jams and all), vacuumed (everything), and wiped down the interior for just $55!!! i gave him an extra $20 for going the extra mile and removing the very little yellow i had on my headlights (which i found later per website actually starts at $40 depending on job). did the entire project in about 45 minutes. eco's auto detail was able to fit me in and come out same day. i missed my opportunity to be first thing in the morning the first time i called due to shopping around. we set appt for about 12:30 and he was here about 1. no big deal as i was in no major rush and just happy he could do it same day. understood issues that might have taken him a bit more time than expected, too. i keep my car pretty clean regurlary as i am an uber driver and need to keep it looking nice. so the fact that it took him about 45 minutes to clean an already pretty decently well kept car goes to show how detailed and clean he makes sure everything is. i'm sure i will be using him to clean my car more regularly now. i believe he said they do take cards, but there is a small fee from the company used....."
5-star,1,"if u want to go cheap that's on you... this guy gives you your money's worth! always on time and always succeeds my expectations. he's the only guy i let touch all 3 of my vehicles! not only does he do good work, he's a good man."
5-star,1,"my husband and i have two vehicles, a toyota camry and a bmw 3 series. alfred cleaned these cars within about 2 hours for $160 (including tip). when i found his information, i called and he answered promptly. he gave me a general idea of how much the detail would cost, but explained that it was best to give the quote upon arrival (just in case the car was in worse shape than described). i understood this, so he set up a time to stop by that evening when my husband came home in order to provide the quote. it was the day before good friday, so my husband came home early. we called alfred and he told us he had the time to clean the cars that day, rather than waiting for the next day. he quoted us ahead of time: $55 for my husband's camry, $75 for my bmw (with extra attention on my dirty wheels). we asked how we could pay and he said cash is best - but i believe this means he also takes credit - so we ran out to the atm. he arrived in good time, shook our hands and was very friendly. he did let us know that he would normally charge a bit more for our cars because we have a dog who we travel with often. even with our backseat hammocks, his fur gets stuck on the carpet and in the crevices, which takes a little extra effort for alfred to remove. he told us he wouldn't charge more because he had already quoted us, which i really appreciated. his van is decked out! he has so much amazing equipment (most of which our cars didn't really need), but it goes to show the variety of situations he is prepared for from the back of the van. our vehicles are aged 10 years apart, but he had everything he needed to properly handle both levels of quality. all we had to do is leave the vehicles outside (we live in an apartment/condo complex) and he had everything necessary to complete his work - as you would expect from a 100% mobile detail company. we checked on him once while walking our dog - the cars looked fantastic and he wasn't even finished. once he was finished, he gave us a call. upon inspecting the vehicles we were pleasantly surprised at the level of detail he put into cleaning our vehicles. he really made them 'shine'. afterwards, while he was cleaning up his supplied and packing the van, he made small talk. we are new to the area, so he recommended some trips we could take (hoover dam), some nicer areas to move (away from the strip) if we were looking to settle down, and also a good real estate agent for our future needs. all in all, i felt like he did a great job on our cars as well as building a business relationship with us for the long term. we keep our cars extremely clean; outside of the dog hair, we never leave trash, we don't eat in the car and we wipe up messes as soon as they may happen. the only reason our cars were this bad is because they had been transported from florida a few months ago. i say this to point out that if you keep your car really junky - with trash bags worth of crap everywhere - don't be surprised if you get a higher quote. either way, whether you have a 1990s hooptie or a bentley, alfred can bring your vehicle back from the brink of death with all his amazing tools and his general knowledge from years in the business. i highly recommend his services; get a free quote if you are worried, but you wont be disappointed."
5-star,1,"we just had both of our vehicles washed and detailed in our driveway, our lexus is 250 and ford f-150 and he did such an amazing job. like mind-blowing good. his prices were a steal for how extremely thorough he was on both vehicles. without a doubt we will be calling eco's auto detail every time we need a wash and/or detail. i feel like we have brand new cars! could not be more happy with today's service and i absolutely love that it's a mobile service that can come to wherever you are. he even offered to come to my work if i needed him to! he was professional, polite, and treated our vehicles like they were right off the show-room floors. ill be recommending them to all of our friends obviously."
1-star,0,"if there could be 0 stars there would be.. called to get my bosses car detailed and at first everything seemed ok. he went to my bosses house and immediately quoted him high cuz he assumed he has money. he even admitted it.. 1000 to detail the car? you're smoking crack buddy.. he said ""i would quote u less but you can afford the 1000 but i'll do a good job"" really? smh... then when he didn't get hired for the job he threw a bucket of lithium grease on the drive way like a kid."
5-star,1,"whenever i need a good detail job for a reasonable amount, this is where i come. aaron is a great employee too! now if yelp will let me get this posted and not have to write 3xs, all will be good! dang yelp!"
5-star,1,"i have just received my first car wash form ecos and am very impressed! absolutely recommend! he told me he'd arrive in 20 minutes and showed up in 15 my car was filthy! after he finished i came out and saw my looking brand new! not only was alfred very polite and professional he also had a good sense of humor and we even ended up talking for a bit after! i give it five stars and would highly recommend to anyone! and lets be honest, who wants to wait outside a terribles for 45 minutes?"
5-star,1,my husband surprised me with a mobile car wash today. he knows i am very pick about people touching cars. i don't go through car washes and hand wash it myself instead. eco's auto detailing did a wonderful job. no swirl or fine scratch marks only a smooth shiney surface. i checked the roof for water spots just because it's las vegas so now that the rain is gone were back to 100 degrees. but nope he left no marks even with the heat drying the truck as fast as he wet it down. and the price was very reasonable.
5-star,1,just had ecos detail my car he did a great job looked like the day i drove it off the showroom floor i called about 730 am and he was at my work in about 30 min he did such a great job i had him follow me home to do my partners car great price for the quality of work .give him a try you won't be dissapointed
5-star,1,"very happy with ecos car wash and detailing... very convenient as they came to my house and cleaned my car at 8 pm and they always accommodate my schedule, very flexible.. great idea my car is always nice and clean thanks to ecos!!!! highly recommend"
5-star,1,eco's auto detail is fantastic i was in need of someone to take water spots and scratches off my range rover 2014 brand-new and i was very picky on who was going to work on my vehicle i called them they came to give me a free estimate very professional professional service very happy and i will be calling him on my next car which is a ferrari thank you guys
5-star,1,"great customer service! i hate renting cars because i feel like i'm usually getting scammed with hidden fees, etc. but we just had a great experience picking up our car. rob was so enthusiastic in helping us and so knowledgeable. we'll see how it goes when dropping off our car! update: no hidden fees, easy car return. thanks guys!!"
5-star,1,"excellent service, reasonable prices. love that there is both car rental and truck rental options at this location. very friendly and helpful staff."
5-star,1,"i want to thank john, the manager, of enterprise at this location. he helped me with a difficult situation in getting my daughter in a rental while i was here in gilbert and she was in denver in desperate need of a rental. i just want to say how much he went above and beyond the usual customer service! i have done other business here at other times and have always been pleased but this was above and beyond! i can't say thank you enough! you rock, john!"
5-star,1,my wife and i rented an suv this past monday for a camping trip. we were upgradrd to the premium suv at no extra charge and it worked out perfectly for all world our camping gear. the customer service was great! the enterprise associate took time to ask where we were going. making an experience personal and friendly goes a.very long way.
1-star,0,"i usually rent from the mesa enterprise on west broadway rd, but was directed to this location closer to my house. first i had a confirmed reservation and needed to be picked up by 9:30 and they were telling my my pick up would be 10-11 am . my husband called and had me picked up in 15 min. once i arrived the reservation had to be redone in my name in order to get the discount usually husband picks up and we have no issues just adding me as an additional driver. once i returned i was asked if id like to use another form of payment which i did. i handed the associate my card and was still charged the card on file and was never given my debit card back. i called the next business day was on hold for 13 min as they looked for the card. when they returned they hadn't found the card and the manager couldn't explain why i was asked for another form of payment and still charged the card on file. so the question is where is my card i handed the associate? needless to say i will not be returning to this location. i average at least 2 rentals a month its a shame i'll need to go across down for a rental now."
5-star,1,"customer service was good, car was ready. i haf to pick up close to closing time, a very busy time. however, the 2 represemtatives there did a nice job keeping all cusyomers in order and meeting our needs as best they could. will come back, thank you."
5-star,1,definitely rent a car from here! they have the greatest customer service! any problem we faced they were able to help. five stars for sure!!
1-star,0,"this location is completely understaffed and unprepared. i was never picked up by enterprise so their tag line ""we'll pick you up"" was entirely invalidated. i waited more than 30 minutes after my appointment until my dealership actually drove me to their location. i then waited another 30 minutes to secure a rental car with a practically empty gas tank. compared to other rental car experiences, this one was subpar to say the least."
1-star,0,incredibly slow and understaffed. both for pick-up and drop off. car had mechanical issues. no after-hour returns. even if one party is ahead of you be prepared to wait. a long time. there is often only one agent working. i won't be back.
5-star,1,"when i got to town in mid july i looked online for a rental car because i had taken the train here. i decided to go with enterprise. my daughter recommended the office at alma school and broadway because she had used them in the past so i entered that location as my choice the website said that they had free pick up and drop off so i called them up and asked for a ride over there, which is only about a mile north. they said they would have to call me back when someone was going to head over. i had an appointment an hour and a half later which was plenty of time. i never heard back from them. i finally called this location about a mile south of me, explained the situation which at this point i only had maybe half an hour to get to my appointment. this location on baseline was very understanding and very efficient. they sent someone over within 15 minutes, zooming me down to the office, had me fill out the paperwork quickly and i was on my way in a dodge avenger to my appointment which fortunately wasn't very far. so if you need a rental car with a pickup, call this location on baseline. even though i had a car reserved at the broadway location and had called for a ride, they never, ever called or came to my location to get me. they lost out on what is now an over three month rental. when it turned out i was going to be here for over a week this office switched me to a monthly rate which i have been on since i got here . i noticed they didn't have very good reviews and i mention that to the manager, dustin. he told me he had just become the manager 2 weeks earlier and that things were improving, which i can totally concur with. i've been in a couple times to renew the car for my extended visit and have encountered nothing but cheerfulness, helpfulness and efficiency on each visit. they have kept in good communication, calling to remind me when i need to go in. when my credit card expired and i had to get a new one they were patient and waited a day or two to charge me. if i encounter any problems when i turn the car in i will update this but so far, all is good!"
2-star,0,"i was not happy with my experience today. i got picked up at the auto repair shop and driven to the enterprise store. at the store i was quoted a daily rate higher than they had said the night before on the phone. (also quoted without the taxes so it was another $7 higher than expected at checkout.) when i declined the expensive insurance coverage the girl tried again to sell it by explaining how my own coverage was lacking. again i declined, but she seemed to think i was offended and said ""its my job, its not meant to be offensive."" i wasn't offended, i know they're on commission. she noted the gas level at 3/8 but i didn't bother to check it myself. i returned the car after driving home, to work and to a gas station after work on the way back to enterprise. i noticed the gas gauge was now at 1/2 tank but i put in 1.1 gallons, $3.75, because i'd driven less than 30 miles. at the store the same girl said she was going outside to check the mileage, came back in and wanted me to bring the gas level up to 3/8 again. when i told her i'd driven under 30 miles she said she'd ""take car of it this time."" i think i got one smile from her when she had picked me up in the morning and nothing but a blank face after that. she wasn't rude but i was uncomfortable with how i was treated. the other counter person was a very nice guy but a 3rd worker kept making bad jokes and when he drove me back to the repair shop his body odor was kinda noticeable. but it was very hot and i think he was the outside worker. overall it wasn't horrible service but i took the time to write this because i didn't like having my word questioned about the gas mileage. i wont use that store again."
5-star,1,these guys are great. unfortunately the staff changes so much due to the environment but other than that i've always gotten great service from here. commercial side is here now too so it's a perfect set up for me. i can rent trucks/vans for work from michael or hit the normal rental car side and get a cruiser.
5-star,1,i've had brian tint and detail over the years 6 of our vehicles. another outstanding small business with top notch work ethics. i alway use trusted networking for any service i need. brian was recommended by compact cars and i have never looked elsewhere.
5-star,1,"i had an appointment this morning w/ brian, to discuss tinting my new-to-me '05 mini that i'm refreshing. he spent a good 20+ minutes with me, walking around the car and discussing my needs. his pricing is fair and he uses good materials (computer-cut, ceramic lumar film). some of the work he couldn't do, but he recommended a few shops to me that could get the work done. i'll be scheduling the tint work soon, feeling confident in the result. i'll post back with pics. ---- edit ---- i dropped off the mini early yesterday morning and picked it up, as promised, around 5pm (i wasn't in a hurry - uber'd home to get some work done). the price was exactly what was estimated and i'm very happy with the tint. brian uses 40% lumar ceramic tint (so it's well on the safe side of legal in north carolina) and it's a very nice pure black color (not the silver or grey/green i've had before). the quality of the work is great... no dust or bubbles to be seen so far and all the cuts are smooth. very nice work. -- edit -- i came back to make a note that brian pointed me in a good direction for some paint and body work that needed to be done, to import paint and body over on e. independence. thanks, brian. the tint is still holding up beautifully, some 4-5 months later."
5-star,1,great job!! my car looks amazing and i am definitely more confident driving it on 77 i know i have the protection i need to keep my car looking great ! oh .. the tint job was amazing i am definitely going to refer you to my friends !! thanks again
5-star,1,"i own a black 2016 370z nismo. i had her parked in the upper deck of the daily parking lot at the charlotte airport a few weeks ago. she was hit by a few ""bird bombs"" and those left etching in my paint. i did some research online and tried to fix the problem myself but ended up causing swirl marks on the finish. now i really did it!!!!! not only was the etching still apparent, so were the swirl marks. i was sooo happy to find exclusive detail on yelp!!!!! i spoke with brian and he put my mind at ease. he's a professional & for my car... a miracle worker! brian understood my dilemma and the seriousness of the paint etching. he worked me into his busy schedule where i dropped off my car in the morning & picked her up that afternoon. my car looked better than the day i saw her on the showroom floor! thank you brian!!!!!"
5-star,1,"i own a 1966 gt40 mk1 and wouldn't trust my car to anyone in charlotte other than brian. over the last six months i've had him install paint protection film, color correct my paint, and apply opts-coat ceramic paint protection. my car has never looked better. brian has an incredible attention to detail and truly cares about his customers. his focus is on doing the job right rather than up-selling services that a customer may not need. if you own a high-end or investment grade car, brian will be a great resource for you."
5-star,1,called on a tuesday and had me in early on wednesday. brian is great and staff is super friendly. excellent work and only waited an hour for a full tint job. definitely recommend!
5-star,1,brian and his guys removed tint and replaced it and they did a great job! they're very professional and easy to work with. i dropped my car off in the morning and picked it up after work. very convenient and their customer service far surpasses other tint businesses. a+
5-star,1,"these guys rocked. i called them early morning, had availability, and got it done that day. the tint quality is top notch and the service was great. this was my second vehicle completed by them. i highly recommend!"
5-star,1,"the experience with exclusive detail was honestly the best i have ever had with any car related service provider. it was extremely high quality, incredibly fast, shockingly reasonably priced, and altogether a totally painless experience. i brought in a car that had scratch damage from the prior owner and brian cleaned it up completely the same day for way less than i expected. i was amazed and will go back anytime for my future detailing needs."
5-star,1,excellent craftsmanship and superior quality customer service. brian and his staff are the best in charlotte. i know this for sure from being born and raised here and having gone through a lot of mediocre detailing and tinting service shops. they will not disappoint!
5-star,1,"after obtaining a 'fail' on my nc inspection for my tinted windows being too dark, although i passed last year, i immediately yelped tint removal and came across exclusive detail and tint. i made a call and spoke with brian, who was very helpful. he even said come on over and they would take care of me that afternoon. although the location is off the beaten path, brian got me there with no problem. after waiting a few minutes my car was pulled in and within one hour the tint was removed and i was ready to go...just in time to get back to the nc inspection center, at which time i passed. before leaving i did talk to brian about replacing the tint, with nc approved levels, obtained pricing and will definitely return. service was on point and they did a great job!"
5-star,1,superior honest service wth integrity at hello! just called (based off of yelp reviews) to get a quote on a car detail before i get it appraised. spoke to brian and told him what i wanted. he shared that getting the car detailed really won't help with appraisal value because the dealer will do it anyway. said he'd tell his sister the same thing as there is no return for me in doing so and when he provides a service he wants to make sure there is value added. i appreciate his transparency and honesty. i will def take my next vehicle to him and strongly encourage those reading these words to do so as well! thanks brian!
5-star,1,"i can definitely see why this place is rated 4-5 stars. i took my gtr here to get tinted, and brian the owner is a professional in this industry and makes you very comfortable! not to mention the competitive pricing along with 100% amazing work! i would recommend this business to anyone looking for tint or detail."
5-star,1,"had brian clean everything on my wife's acura and could've asked for a better job. her car was in rough shape from years of neglect. the car looks showroom ready. brain was honest, respectful and realistic. my wife and i were running a little late when coming back to pick the car up and he still spent the time to go over the vehicle with us. will be a lifetime customer!"
5-star,1,"i setup my appointment for my 2016 vw gti by email which was very easy. i also called a couple times to get some additional info regarding tint options. both types of contact were great and brian was very responsive. when i arrived we looked over my tint options and brought the sample tint glass out to the car to get a good idea of how it would turn out. customer service is important to me and they were on it the whole time i was there, as i did not have anyone to pick me up and drop me off. tint job was done very well and final product looks really great. they were even able to get the small front triangle windows that are not easy to reach on this car due to the dash and windshield angle. i highly recommend exclusive detail and tint."
5-star,1,"would definitely recommend, he did a fantastic job on my car and i got my windows tinted as well - all wonderfully done! i was a little hesitant about the tinting being too dark at first, but he reassured me and was able to show me examples and talk me through the process and the warranty. the car looks awesome now, and am recommending to friends in the area. very accommodating - thanks brian!"
5-star,1,"i recently had my vw cc windows tinted here and am very pleased with the quality of the tint. my vehicle is registered in south carolina and they were able to provide a darker tint. the customer service is excellent, i was told when my vehicle would be ready when i dropped it off and i also received a call informing me it was ready. all around great establishment, i highly recommend it!!"
5-star,1,nice family who owns this business it's right off the light rail so you can drop your car off and take the right light rail back to work or home would recommend this place to friends or family
5-star,1,"had a great experience here getting my car tinted. brian gave me a good overview of the options and the tints turned out great. highly recommend you work with them for tints or anything else, you can tell that they do quality work."
5-star,1,"i had brian tint my car and his shop did a great job. i've had all my other cars tinted through dealers. the quality of brian's work is a definite step above what i've had at dealers for the same or less money. the tint went on perfectly, without a single bubble. brian and his family were very nice and easy to deal with. also, the location is great if you work uptown - the light rail station is a few hundred feet away. i was able to drop my car in the morning and pick it up that afternoon via the train."
5-star,1,"i brought my subaru outback to brian yesterday to get tinted. the back window had some tiny welding spray from when the car was fixed. this left tiny, completely unnoticeable bubbles in the tint. although it was no fault of brian's, he still upgraded me to the top of the line tint on the front windows at no extra cost. he is a very nice guy and cares about his customers. i put 35% on the front and 20% on the back. it looks great. i will recommend brian to all of my friends."
5-star,1,"brian and his team did amazing work on my black 2001 bmw z3 coupe! 13 years of oxidation, swirls, and scratches were magically lifted via polishing and paint touch up and whatever else brian did to give the car a true show-room quality look. brian took the time to discuss pros and cons of different tint option, as well as what percentage of tint would meet my needs and capture the look i wanted. i went with 40% ceramic film and the application was flawless! i've had many of my other vehicles ""detailed"" at dealerships, car washes, and detailing by tim in charlotte; as well as tint application through autoshield & sunstoppers and i regret that i wasn't referred to brian's exclusive detail earlier! unmatched professionalism, quality, and trust! highly recommended!"
5-star,1,(had to get my tint removed upon moving to nc) brian was very understanding that i had to bring my 2 year old to my apt time and got the job done in an hour instead of 2! great customer service and job well done. i will be going back when i get new tint put back on it!
1-star,0,"i will not be back, and i'm sure brian won't miss me or care about it, probably would prefer it to be that way. i went here in november after i bought my altima to have my windows tinted. i was living in sc and was planning on moving into nc after the new year. well i recently went to have my car inspected and it did not pass for the tint being too dark. i immediately called brian and he asked that i bring it in to have a look. when i got there, he wanted to drive me to work, drop me off, and take my car to have it inspected himself. uh yeah, that is not happening, so i drove us to one of his friends places to have the tint inspected, but his tester did not have working batteries, he just told brian it would be too dark. if brian does tint, why does he not have his own tester?? as we were going back to the shop, he explained how it was not his fault and that he would give me a deal to not charge me for the removal, just the new tint. while that's great that i'm getting a ""deal"" and i appreciate that, it would have been nice to know about the nc/sc differences before when i was originally getting it done as i would have gone with nc tint to begin with and i would not have to worry about a ""deal"". i make an appointment for friday morning and show up with my car. he tells me i am going to have to bring it back another day. really?? well this is inconvenient for me!! his response: ""how so?? did you ever think about why you need to bring it back? i have two cars that are taking longer than expected and i have 7-8 cars waiting to be taken care of."" okay and? a simple, yet customer friendly courteous response would have been, ""megan, i'm sorry for then inconvenience, i overbooked."". oh no, it's too much for brian to take any responsibility or blame, an appology would have gone a long way. i took my car back yesterday to be done, not any kind of friendliness, apology for last week, thanks for your business (or me sending him business in the past), etc. from brian. i'm glad it is all done as i will never go back. work is okay, but customer service goes a long way with the work, and frankly, he doesn't have it."
5-star,1,they honoured my check-in offer from yelp even though they had intended for that offer to have already been over and off of the app. they quoted me one hour and honestly it probably only took about 20 minutes to get the front two windows of my small suv tinted. they did a great job and they were a pleasure to work with. they were also very patient with my lateness despite my appointment time.
5-star,1,this place is great! i just bought a new (used) car which needed a good amount of tlc. brian got me in right away and they did amazing work. every nook and cranny was cleaned and the car shined like new! brian is my go to guy for all future detailing. i will go back in a few weeks for window tinting also...his pitch was very convincing:) thanks again!
5-star,1,"brian did an amazing job on my window and he was fast! i had to get my driver side window tint removed and put back on!, he was done in about 20-25 min and it looks amazing! very nice guy!"
5-star,1,"my car was a disaster when i brought it in to brian's exclusive detail. i travel long distance quite frequently, so there was a lot of dirt and bugs all over it. there were also scratches all over the hood that i had been told probably warranted a total paint job. after bringing my car in to brian's, it literally looks like a new car. he did an amazing job for what i thought was a very fair price. the scratches are completely gone and every inch of the interior was completely clean. he kept me updated during the detail process and never did anything without checking with me first. i also like that he didn't give me a hard time about the state of my car, just gave me some tips for how to maintain it going forward. also helps that his garage is right off of the light rail, so if you're like me and you work uptown, it's easy to drop the car off and then pick it up at the end of the day."
5-star,1,"i purchased a used ford escape a few years ago that already looked fairly beat up at the time of sale. a few years later, my sport fabric looked like the exorcist had been at work in my truck. i was embarrassed of my vehicle, and i didn't really like driving it anymore. my husband decided to get it detailed as a birthday gift and told me to pick the place. after reading the reviews and seeing the portfolios of different companies, i selected brian's because the price was less that i expected and the reviews were stellar. still, i had low expectations because sport fabric is so notorious for staining. brian was kind, joyful to be around, and honest. he told me it probably wasn't going to be ready the same day, which wasn't an issue. i was pleased that he planned to take the time to really work on the issues. the next morning, i picked up my escape, and i was breathless! it looks better than when i bought it. not a trace of the stains-even those from before i purchased it- remains! my dash and console are now actually tan and brown instead of the weird gray color they had turned from years of debris.top that off with the fact that my paint job looks like liquid glass, and i couldn't be happier."
5-star,1,i have an early model lexus brian has serviced for several years helping me keep it looking like new. brian's is very meticulous using not only the best products but the correct products based on the application. i highly recommend brian's work.
5-star,1,fast-trac always delivers with 5 stars. from our shirts all the way to our childcare vans for both our schools. we have had all 4 of our vans done in a complete wrap and they have done an amazing job. all questions answered and reasonable prices. judy and sean are very easy to get along with and their staff are always friendly. we have used fast-trac for 13 years and plan to stay with them forever. sorry judy your stuck with me for the long haul.
1-star,0,"i tried having a window vinyl made for my new salon business through fast trac. i'm giving fast trac two stars instead of one because initially when i met with the owner, she was excited and enthusiastic about our business, and was helping us choose what design, color, font etc to use. i left her office extremely satisfied and excited. two weeks went by before i received a draft on what my window vinyl would look like. my name and my business partners name were spelled wrong, words were placed incorrectly and the color was off. i responded immediately letting them know what i did and didn't like. two more weeks went by before i heard from them again and it was another ok draft (it looks like a photoshop job i could have done on my iphone). i responded that it looked fine enough. it was then almost two more weeks before i called them asking about when they could install it and we could be done with this ordeal. suddenly after i had to reach out to them, they all the sudden had my vinyl ready to be installed same day. i wasn't working that day so i requested the next day and they said they would call me first thing in the morning to schedule. the next day at 1pm i finally called them and told them to forget about it because it was too much work to have this installed, i wasn't happy with their service and i was quoted the same service from another company for 70% less, and same day installation. getting a partial refund from fast trac has been a joke, and my check was mailed to the incorrect address and judy's costumer service has been rude overall. i don't think this is a bad company i think they just have poor business ethics, especially for a small company and their service could have been done much quicker, as demonstrated by the other company we went through. edit: we still haven't received our check from judy. i was doing my checks and balances for my business because it is the beginning of the month. i called judy and politely asked to simply know the amount of the check i am supposed to be receiving. she was incredibly rude saying ""what you can't wait fifteen minutes? call me back later"". i asked her to put me on hold for the 15 minutes instead. she put me on hold the. hung up after 7 minutes. i called back and the receptionist answered and answered all my questions. she was very sweet. judy is flipping crazy though."
5-star,1,"they did a great job with wrapping our work truck. it looks amazing and was finished on budget. i have had so many compliments on it in just a few days. thanks fast-trac, we appreciate your good work!"
5-star,1,"i can not say enough good things about my experiences with fast-trac designs. they have gone above and beyond to make each experience perfect. they have done our business's utility truck wrap, t-shirts, door magnets and perforated vinyl on a back window . but the purchase that stands out above it all is our most recent bus wrap. that is right - we purchased a school bus to wrap and -oh boy- it was a fixer upper project. we first attempted to do all of the body work ourselves. we got as far as cutting off the rub rails, removing the stop sign and over-sized front mirrors, taking out the bolts and attempting to smooth out the surface. the attempt to smooth out the surface ended up causing a not-so-smooth surface and we were in a bit of a time crunch. i took it to a body shop and felt helpless among the sales man quoting me over $2500 to make the body of the bus wrap-friendly. i called sean at fast trac designs and explained my predicament. sean told me to stay right where i was at and he was going to come to me. sean and jody drove all the way out to the body shop where i had the bus for pricing. after they spoke to the rep at the body shop, they did some calculating and told me the price was way off from what they figured the cost to be and the shop probably just didn't want the job. they told me they knew just the body shop to take it too. i followed them to the body shop (yes, they drove to another body shop during their work day so that i could conveniently follow them there) and was happily greeted by the owner of the shop. he made me feel like an old friend and quoted me 1/4 of the price that i was given by the previous body shop. i was then driven by sean & jody to their shop so i could wait for my husband to pick me up. judy was very nice and showed me around the shop and kept me company until my ride arrived. the body work was finished in 2 days and fast-trac designs picked up the bus for me and transported it back to their shop. they had it wrapped and ready in 3 days so i could have it in time for my weekend event. they met me on a saturday morning when they are generally closed so that i could have it for my event. the impossible was finished in 1 week and it was all thanks to fast trac designs going above and beyond to make miracles happen. i can not thank them enough. thank you sean, judy, jody, aspen and the rest of the team behind the scenes for a wonderful experience. if you need a vehicle wrap, window vinyl, door magnets, or promotional merchandise .... do not look any further than fast-trac designs. you found your go-to company!"
5-star,1,"i had to turn to some creative designers to come up with a wrap for a yellow and purple phoenix bass boat. i found that with fast trac designs. sean,jody and all the designers captured the look i needed and wanted to showcase the colors and features of the phoenix brand and to put the spotlight on the sponsors as well as the boat. this wrap has so many features, it's eye catching from a distance and more features are revealed the closer you get. from the three dimensional tell tail phoenix wings to the hidden schools of skeletal bass you don't see till you get close to the boat. if your thinking about a wrap for your vehicle,boat or spaceship don't hesitate to call these guys and gals. they will give you the best value and service in the state."
5-star,1,i had meet sean and ernie at a trade event and recently ordered some business cards from them. the experience was fantastic and i got high quality cards for a great price.
5-star,1,"a friend of mine introduced me to this business to get our logos done for our business trucks. i am so happy he did! i worked with jody, who was very patient with me. the pricing was better than anyone else we've come across and the quality could not be better! i am so happy our trucks look professional now! they are definitely the experts in their field of work and i will definitely be using their services again. thanks so much for everything you have done for us!"
5-star,1,i used fast trac designs to develop a logo for our company and also to make our company uniforms and t-shirts w/ our logo design. i was amazed at how fast the work was completed. the logo exceeded my expectation. mark (designer) sat down w/ me to make final changes to our logo design until we had it perfect. our uniforms and t-shirts also came out perfect and again exceeded my expectations. i definitely recommend this company to anyone who is looking for a great company that will go out of its way to make sure you are 100% satisfied.
5-star,1,"i wish i found this place sooner. i discovered fast-trac on my phone's google maps. this place is great. they do just about everything involving printing. from vehicle wraps to business cards, this is my new one stop print shop. i met judy about a week or so ago. she helped me get started on some custom mailer postcards. she was very professional, direct and honest. within a few days esteban emailed me my proof. we went over some changes, i signed the approval and my expected delivery was about a week. to my surprise, i received a call about 3 days later stating they had arrived. after a meeting with sean, i could very well tell that this business was interested in helping local businesses like mine, develop a long, healthy business relationship with a reputable design and print firm. thank you fast-trac. i'll see you again when it's time to order more."
1-star,0,absolute shit. it's a mickey mouse dinky service that doesn't respond to you and it's run by insanely unreliable people. all marketing hype. stop pretending to be a real company or even a scrappy upstart when you're just a cool website that is unreachable to book an appointment. what a joke.
1-star,0,good for basic things but everything else i think it's better to be in a mechanic shop where they have all the necessary tools and hoist. i wonder if there is any home owners liability to worry about if anything happens?
5-star,1,was on a road trip to toronto when my car started squeaking. these guys sent a mechanic to check out my car and in a few minutes they detected my break pads were totally worn out and they gave me a great deal. highly recommend
1-star,0,"had a pretty major wiring issue with my car and was getting fed up with no one being able to fix it. decided to try fiix as my car wasn't running and thought having someone come to my house would be convenient. they assured me over the chat they have on their site, that they had a vw specialist peter, who they were pretty confident would be able to fix my car within 3 hours. i repeatedly told them it was a complicated issue but they assured me they could fix the problem. well peter came, left an hour later giving me a ""diagnosis"" that only stated that i had a wiring problem (obviously?) that was too complicated for him. he then told me to bring it to a mechanic or a vw dealership as he could not do anything for me. charged me 355$ which i had to get rectified cause i was over charged. in the end they still charged me 200$. extremely unprofessional and not knowledgable in anything more than changing your oil or tires. definitely not fun to be taken advantage of."
5-star,1,"i highly recommend everyone try this company. they are fast, friendly and professional. peter, the mechanic, amazing i'm so happy with the work he did and that he was so honest. he was super friendly and so professional. i will be booking again for my oil change and brake fluid flushed. they do so much and you don't even have to leave your home, which is so convenient. i feel so happy when he told me the tank didn't need to changed; that the other place was mistaken. just the line needs to fixed. i appreciated his honesty. and it really changed my opinion for the better. it just proves sometimes first impressions aren't always right and i can admit i was. this place is amazing give them a call and book. you will not regret it."
5-star,1,i had great service from peter at fiix on my mini cooper today. peter arrived early and prepared. he was knowledgeable and friendly. i highly recommend peter and fiix. they are definitely the uber of mechanics .
5-star,1,definitely one of the most convenient ways to get your car serviced. i needed to get my brakes changed but have always had a hard time getting an appointment from a mechanic because of my demanding work schedule. i tried fiix based on advice from a friend and was really impressed with the service. they came to my house and i really liked how i can see them doing the work. overall a really cool new idea fixing the worst part about car ownership.
5-star,1,"couldn't have asked for a better service. i needed my car's battery replaced asap and when i contacted fiix via facebook messenger (they host a page you can talk to), they immediately replied with instructions on how to set up an appointment, and they even offered to perform the replacement on the same day!! they were super flexible on the time and i was able to book a 7pm appointment (note that this is probably impossible at an auto repair shop). the mechanic arrived at my house exactly by 7pm and the service was phenomenal. not only did he replace the car battery so quickly, but he also performed other checks on the car to ensure that other things look good. and the final price we paid was even cheaper than we would have paid at an auto repair shop! the convenience of receiving the service anywhere you want at any time you want is actually the best thing ever. looking forward to using fiix for future car needs!"
5-star,1,"these guys are as good as it gets honestly. so great to see young talent pave the way for a niche that serves a purpose. i can't believe how easy it was, how convenient it was rather than lugging around my tires to a shop, wasting over 3 hours round trip and gas, than to just have the fiix guys come to my house, and actually do it while i was saving time doing errands nearby! great young guys that do it to super polite and will 100% use these guys for every season for every car i ultimately have. keep up the great idea!"
5-star,1,"amazing service! i love their easy to use website, where i just booked online to get my tires changed and it showed me a picture of who is exactly was coming and a little biography about them as well. i can't express how the customer service went above and beyond my expectations. i love the fact that i could just relax at home during the process. i'd recommend fiix to anyone! you won't be disappointed."
5-star,1,great customer service. trustworthy staff and easy to work with. i called these guys to help me change my tires because there's no way i am putting tires in my convertible coupe. they gelled me out in the comfort of my own home. that's great and solves a real need.
5-star,1,"just found out today from an employee that fills sold all of there stores to s&s fuels which took over all the city stops here in the valley. s&s fuels sells sinclair fuel and the convenient store is a 7eleven. anyway today i stopped in after getting a massage next door. i walked inside (doors were haft open as they are only selling fuel). i asked the employee of they were selling drinks and she said for today no, as we are under remodel as we turn from fills to 7eleven. she even told me that 7eleven is redoing the car wash and has already replaced the graffiti gas pumps with new ones. its nice to know that the store is finally transforming from an expansive store to more of an convenient 7eleven. will be back. gas prices were $2.22 too due to remodeling. nice"
3-star,0,"not thrilled with the lack of customer service. if i tell you that a pimp is not working properly, simply do what you need to do to make it work instead of arguing with me. sometimes technology doesn't work properly and there is no reason to blame the customer. just fix it."
5-star,1,i absolutely love all the employees at this location. every single time i walk out of this place i get a truly happy and friendly employee. i never see a person that didn't want to be here. always smiling and laughing with their customers. i love coming here for my snacks
2-star,0,"the store looked awesome..... the kid behind the counter was super annoying !!!!!!!! he must have been like 19 or 20.....trying to test me on gas mileage and math....im a 32 year old grow woman who just got off work, all i wanted was a few bucks in gas and be on my way....not be on 'are you smarter then a gas attended' game show....really turned me off...."
1-star,0,i've tried to give this gas station a chance three times. their receipt machines never work. don't go here if you have to save receipts.
1-star,0,"i am not a believer. the biggest thing this place has going for it is location because you can easily get on 215 east from durango, but there are a few problems... i leave for work between 0345 and 0430. on more than one occassion it has been closed for no apparent reason. the last time there was an employee inside, sitting stoic, didn't make eye contact with me. second issue is price. they are consistently $.08-.12 higher per gallon than the shell across the street. shell is not cheap gas! if it were a rebel, it would make more sense. third is the actually employees. they have some really interesting people working there. i am pretty sure they don't drug test. they are in no way friendly and the service is pretty bad!"
1-star,0,"gotten worse, now owned by firestone. discontinued oil service we had paid for a lifetime. stay away! no one is there anymore, bays are empty......obviously i'm not the only one leaving them."
1-star,0,my experiences with fletcher's were always positive. my first experience after the firestone take-over was the exact opposite. stay away.
1-star,0,scheduled an appointment for 8am for an oil change and they didn't get started working on my car until 9:20. their excuse was that they were behind this morning and couldn't get started on in sooner. that is exactly why i scheduled an appointment for the first available spot in the morning. i will be finding a new auto care shop from now on. i would absolutely not recommend coming to this location.
5-star,1,"since the switch from fletcher's to firestone they have been amazing and super helpful every time i go in! i come here for everything because of how much i trust them. not only am i greeted every time i come in i'm welcomed back to come in ""even for the little things"" which usually end up being free check ups. they also help me feel safe coming in and make me feel like i'll be taken care of. i usually bring a male friend who knows more about cars with me so shops don't take advantage of me, but here i don't need to worry about! they actually give me updates if i'm waiting in shop about what exactly they are doing with my car and they keep to their appointments. eli at the front is amazing and super helpful, so is everyone else too! will always come back here!"
2-star,0,"i am pissed off at this place. i have always used a dealer for my services, but because my lexus rx has gotten older i decided to try out this neighborhood firestone, which used to be called fletcher's auto, until march of this year. i really wanted to establish a relationship with them so i can have my car serviced nearby the neighborhood. i went for a brakes job because they were pulsating at this time; i left the car there for evaluation. they called me and recommended to change all the rotors on four wheels and so forth, to which i accepted. i also asked for transmission flush, which they were please to perform. all these cost $799.99, which was fine. they recommended to work on my front axles for $421 to which i said no, thanks. they then recommended to replace my struts because they saw a small leak, stating that with the age of the car it is expected. i told them that my struts were actually not the originals that came with the car, and so i said no, thanks again. just to tell you that they will keep trying to add work, so don't let that happen; fix only what you go there for. now why am i upset? this morning i noticed that the car i picked up from them yesterday evening has a long dark bruise around the rim of the front white bumper, through an area 18 inches long. i know my car very well and i would not fail to notice a scratch that long staring at me like that. i called and went back this morning then ran into a choir of denial. they were not honest to own up. they refused to take responsibility. how can i prove! no surprise! i left there feeling sorry for them wondering why all the mechanics were standing out there with no cars to work on. i wish i had read these reviews i wouldn't have gone there. the last time i did service there, the guy called eli, notorious eli, i've read about in other complaints here, charged me for replacing the bulbs in my lexus headlamp. i knew well that the bulbs in that particular headlamp are not replaceable, there is no access. you replace the headlamp assembly as a unit, not one bulb each. i confirmed that with the dealer, just in case, even though i've know for a long time. so i caught him in a lie. to me honesty is everything. that's it for me. update: yesterday, one week after the above experience i took my car to arrowhead lexus dealership to evaluate and tell me if there were problems with the front axle or the struts. they inspected my car and returned with the verdict that i do not have any problems with these items. so it further confirms that firestone tried to hack me. i could've been out a lot of money had i fallen for it."
1-star,0,"took car in they did $800 worth of work, noticed when i got home there were spots left in my drive. gave it a couple days and still drops, looked under the front of the car and the shroud on the under part of the front end was missing. i called and asked if they had the large plastic shroud that protect the undercarriage there that goes to my car, yep its here. no one called to tell me the 3 days i had the car back. the tech forgot to put it back on and another piece back on. i had to make another trip back and have it re installed. there is still one part of it missing and eli said he would check and get back with me, its been two days and no phone call nothing. don't count on follow up with this location"
1-star,0,bought the groupon for $17 only to be told because the vehicle ran on full synthetic and not the blend the groupon was for they charged an additional $38 bucks. so actually no deal at all. that's called a bait and switch in my opinion. i left a voice message for corporate to call me back. i'd like to know their response.
1-star,0,"completely unsatisfied with this place! went there to get the brakes taken care of which were making a grinding noise. talked with eli at the front desk, he started out very nice and professional. after 2 hours they finally told me that the front rotors were shot and could not be resurfaced. wanted to charge me for all new brakes and the quote came back over 500$! i called a few more places their quotes were in the mid 300's. finally called the brakes plus right up the street from this place, spoke to mark, he quoted me 280 and said bring your car in, we'll re-inspect it. went back in to tell eli with fletchers that i'm not going to have them do the work on my car. his attitude changed real quick, professionalism went right out the door. he said he had to tell his mechanic to put my wheels back on. got in my car and drove to brakes plus, my brakes were making way more noise than before they messed with it. i used to have a vehicle serviced by fletcher for years. i'll never go back there again or any other location for that matter! overall bad customer service and tried to rip me off! oh and not to mention, my rotors were not shot, and brakes plus resurfaced them in their shop! great customer service at brakes plus! (83rd & deer valley)"
1-star,0,"tried to rip me off!!!!!!! told me i needed new rotors and new brakes! $370 total. took a blow hearing that. called brakes plus down the street, told me that could be done for $275. dropped it off at brakes plus just to find out i don't need those things, only my rotors to be resurfaced. and there was a customer in brakes plus getting a second opinion after being told the same thing from fletcher!! $120 total. $250 in savings. thanks for nothing fletcher's!"
1-star,0,"nothing like paying for a groupon for an oil change, and come to find out i need to pay an additional 38$ because my car can only take full synthetic. besides the fact that i've had the oil changed plenty of other times without this being the case. 17$ groupon ended up costing me 56$. thanks"
1-star,0,"well, if i want to be a yelper i need to post unsatisfied reviews as well as the good. i took my car in june 2016. i called at 8:30am on a friday and told the man the a/c wasn't cooling as it should. the man who answered told me to bring it in. i got the car there at 9am. the man told me they would call with an estimate. i didn't get a call so i called at 12:30pm and was told they were busy and hadn't gotten to it and they would call me. i didn't get a call so i called at 3pm and was told they were just getting to it. by 5pm i had places to go so i gave up. they called me at 5:30pm to give me the estimate. by this time i had no more trust in them. i went the next morning and picked up my car to take somewhere else. i think, if they were busy, they should not have told me to come in and instead made an appointment for me to go in the next day. waiting all day, just for an estimate, is not good business."
1-star,0,terrible service. i have gone there fee times. every time service is awful. today will be the last. stopped in to have a noise diagnosed. was at the door at 8 when they opened. was told there would be a 2 hr wait. explained i would rather make and appt and come back. was then told they would pull it right in for me. an hour and half later they still had me sitting there. when i asked about the progress i was rudely told i would just have to come back for a couple more hours. they also did an oil change for me and my truck left with an engine light on and a new noise it never had... bad service. bad work.. wont trust them again.
1-star,0,"well, my husband took my suburban in on november 30th 2015 for an oil change. no appt and had our 8 mo old son with him. he ended up waiting 2 hours for this simple oil change to be done. no other checks were done on the vehicle at all. that leads me into my next encounter i had on january 26, 2016. i had actually called the day before because i discovered a nail in my side wall and i wanted them to confirm i needed it replaced and to order my new tire for me like they needed to last time. i felt with rick, he confirmed a new tire was needed and set an appt for me in the morning while my two older boys were at school and i would only have my 10 mo old with me and it would be before his nap time. the original appt was set for 9:30. i arrived and adam told me that rick should have set it for a later time as the delivery of the tire wouldn't be until between the time of 10:30am and 12pm. so i had to plan to come back around my sons nap time. i came back about 11:30 because i also needed a balance as i was experiencing some shaking while driving on the freeway, figured they would get started on that if the tire hadn't arrived yet. they didn't. i ended up being there for over 2 hours... and this is after making an appt and making the effort i did the day before to avoid all this wait. very frustrating. they replaced my rear tire and i asked them to check for an oil leak as i had some spots in my garage from my truck. they couldn't find a leak... but i found it funny that i had spots in my garage from the last time they performed the oil change and after that day there were no more leaks. they must have tightened the oil pan... i checked because i laid down a large white poster from the dollar store under my truck and there are no more oil leaks... so at least that's fixed... well i waited for over 2 hours... i watched off and on from the waiting area by the bathroom... i thought it was weird that the guys were out there in the bay smoking while working... maybe things would go faster if they didn't have to take breaks to light up. and during this time they said it was about done and i asked if they had balanced all tires and they said they would get it done... what was i waiting on?? why weren't they all balanced like i asked. anyway, dealing with all that and a fussy baby because it was his nap time was no good! i don't drive on the hwy or freeway often... my boys go to school about 2.5-3 miles away from where we live, which also happens to be 83rd ave and deer valley. just to give you an idea of how much i drive. well last weekend we decided to go to dinner at bobby q's off i-17 and the front of my truck was shaking way worse than it was before i got the ""balance"" done. everything was rattling and it was very scary! especially because i have my 3 small boys that i drive around. my husband was also very concerned saying the balance should have fixed any shaking going on. he told me to take it back in. i called the next morning and made an appt for today, wednesday feb 10th, 2016. i had an appt for 10am to have the tires balanced again. they said t would take about an hour. so i walked to albertsons with my now 11 mo old and grabbed a few groceries we needed. i got back and waited a bit and by this time it had been almost an hour as i had dropped off my keys at 9:49 and it was almost 10:45 for them to come inside and tell me that my two front tires needed to be replaced because the inside of the tires were so worn down.... what????? i've been here 3 different visits prior to today, all long visits at that for them to tell me that now i need two new front tires?? why is this just now being brought up? why wasn't it mentioned when i got the tires ""balanced"" last time? or why wasn't it brought up when there was a guy changin my oil and could see my tread was wearing down? that's a sales opportunity first of all and a safety issue!!!! that's your job to find and let the customer know if there is an issue. there was never any mention of my front tires from any of my previous visits... i still have all my receipts and what has been done along with any notes... not one word was mentioned about my tires inner tread getting low or them recommending i need a rotation or anything... my front left tire measured 1/32..... that's bad! and it was on the inner side of the tire, so it's not exactly where you can see it on a normal regular basis. but they have been up under my truck including today, 4 times. and i'm just now being told this. also while they took me out there to show me the inner tread of my front tires, i'm holding my baby and the guy talking to me lights up a cigarette two feet away from me and my baby inside the bay??!!!!!!!! hello????? if you want a smoke break you don't take it next to a customer as you're explaining what's going on and they are holding a baby in their arms! go out back where customers can't see you while you're on break and smoke. how unprofessional. no consideration."
2-star,0,"the service is terrible here. i went because it was right down the street and it seemed convenient. i arrived with a flat tire leaking, eli asked about the car, he never came out to look it over. this seemed a little questionable, then he told me it would be 30mins till they could look at it. he never called me, i called an hour and a half later to ask and he told me it had a puncture in the wall. since he never came out to initially look for the puncture, i was pretty hesitant to believe him. everywhere i have gone in the past would send someone out to at least diagnose it and show me the damage. the tire ended up costing $250 which was way too much. i won't be coming back. eli also lacks proper customer service etiquette as he greets everyone as ""buddy"" instead of sir, mam, or your actual name. this is such a convenient location, it's a shame they don't seem to care about their service experience."
1-star,0,i took my vehicle in to get a check engine light fixed and dropped my vehicle off in the morning. i didn't receive a call all day and had to go in at 5:30 when they closed to see if my vehicle was finished. they ran a very quick diagnostic on my vehicle and then came back in with a 1600 dollar estimate. after i said i would take my vehicle elsewhere the guy working the front desk somehow took 600 dollars off my bill. honest mechanics will start out with the fair price. not try to work you over for more money. after still saying no the person working the front counter had poor customer service and told me i didn't care. to me honesty in a company is very important. which was not the service that i got at fletcher's auto and tire. but i took my truck down to sunburst automotive who gave me an honest price which was half the cost for parts and cheaper labor.
1-star,0,"worst customer service ever, they should invest in building customer relations instead of poor attitudes. they act as if you are putting them out of their way to do work they are in business for. not sure who the manager is but you need to open your eyes and ears."
5-star,1,"i've been to this fletcher's about 5 times now. they do not advertise a 15 minute oil change so all the people complaining that they take too long should probably pay the extra money to go to a place that does. however, if you can be patient, these guys really stand by their work. i made a 9am appointment and was out by 10:15. the longest i've ever waited is an hour and a half. adam and rick at the front desk were friendly and interacted with my 3 year old who was waiting with me. when i got home, i had an issue with my oil change and called the location. rick was very helpful and took me very seriously. he fully resolved the issue at their expense and was humble and patient enough to explain what happened. regardless of the issue (these men are only human), i feel extremely well taken care of as customer and a person. this place will continue to receive my business at the exclusion of all the ""faster"" and more expensive locations."
5-star,1,"we purchased a used vehicle and took it here to get the fluids checked and just for them to go over the vehicle to make sure it was in good working order. ( we know where to put the gas in and that's about it) unfortunately for us, it had other issues either the seller didn't choose tell us or know about. adam, the store manager helped us prioritize the items that should have our attention first and other things that could wait until later. he also told us that they have a service for around $60 that they would look over a vehicle you are wanting to purchase and they will tell you everything that is wrong with it. definitely will use that service in the future, before we buy our next used car... was impressed with his thoroughness and kindness. will surely be back."
1-star,0,"this place is unbelievably disappointing. strike one was the fact that it took over an hour and a half for a simple oil change even though i made an appointment earlier in the week. strike two, after buying a $17 oil change groupon and taking care of it up front they decided to charge me another $5 after they were finished for ""taxes and a fee"". third strike was when i got into my truck and there were black marks all over my door and all over my steering wheel. this place need a lesson on how to run a business."
4-star,1,adam got my car in the day i called for an appointment. ..need a oil change and the breaks done. we didn't want to come back here after a issues we had but adam took care of everything and it was a pleasant experience this time. thanks adam
1-star,0,"last month my wife took in her car because of an oil leak. they did some engine modification and up-sold us on some ac line replacements. when she got her car back it still had an oil leak and her ac would only blow hot air. the mechanic stripped her oil drain plug and there was still problems with the ac lines. last week i took my car in for a check engine light. they tried to up-sell $400 for an oil pressure switch, belt and air filter housing. the belt is in good shape and the air filter housing is a missing a screw. spoke to another fletchers, midas and gm dealership about air filter housing replacement. all of them agree that there is no reason to replace the housing. this location is horrible, go to the 35th ave and union hills location or find another repair shop."
4-star,1,"a lot of old reviews might say this place isn't good but i enjoyed the customer service. i took my car in with my groupon believing i needed the brakes changed. after inspecting them i was told that the brakes were fine. i'm happy that they were honest with me instead of lying. check out the groupon available now, it's a great value for all they will do for your vehicle."
4-star,1,"not sure why the bad reviews here. i always make appointments for my oil changes and they are usually done within an hour. i walk over somewhere and have lunch, when i return it is done. one time they didn't get it done during the hour and the oil change was free!!! i have found that they are honest. and with a car shop, that means something. they don't sell me a new air filter every time! i had the dealer tell me the battery was bad on my toyota, so i took it by this fletchers and they tested it. it was fine. the dealership used the wrong setting. the battery lasted another 18 months before i replaced it. i have never been sold something i didn't need at this fletchers location and i have been going here for over 10 years now with 2 cars. and i could go on and on about how much money they have saved me from what the dealer 'recommended' that didnt need to be done. i take it to fletchers and ask them to check it out and 9 times out of 10, it is fine. i have had bad experiences at other fletchers, but not this one. they have always treated me fairly and have been honest. the guys working the desk aren't always the most personable, but i have yet to feel like i am getting ripped off like so many other car places. good work and honest...that is what i look for in a auto shop and this fletchers provides that! the only reason i didnt give 5 stars is the fact that it takes a week to get an appointment because they are always busy...and what i mentioned about the front desk."
1-star,0,"i made an appointment for 9am this morning to redeem the first of my five groupon oil changes . i was there on-time and instructed the manager that i was in a hurry, and just wanted my oil to be changed as quickly as possible. from the waiting area i watched for 45 minutes as the mechanic slowly worked on changing my oil in between coffee, and generally wandering around. fifteen minutes after i watched him re-fill my oil, he finally brought my keys to the front desk. i asked the manger how i might be able to make this process go faster next time and he said i should make an appointment. i corrected him and let him know that i had an appointment. he then said that i should expect them to take 45-60 minutes every time. i reminded him that i told him i was in a hurry and all they needed to do to ensure that i have a good experience was to get my oil changed. any walmart or danny's car wash regularly changes my oil in 10-15 minutes, so i did not expect this to be an unfair request. i feel it's important that the owner of this fletcher tire & automotive be made aware that his staff missed this groupon opportunity to convert me to a loyal customer."
4-star,1,"mistakes happen! many service garages make mistakes. this fletcher auto drained my power steering fluid thinking it was my oil filter holder. this is easy to do. my oil filter holder is up on top of the engine next to the ps reservoir. the simply forgot to re-fill the ps reservoir & as i left i heard the grinding of the ps pump saying ""hey whats up"". i checked it and yep it was empty. i do carry this fluid as a back in my car and re-filled it and called fletcher auto who responded with the greatest of apologies ""mistakes happen"". i believe them because i made the same mistakes when i hurry also to get done doing something in my car. fletcher auto gave me a free oil change and were honest enough to remedy the error. they just forgot to re-fill the ps reservoir. hey ""mistakes happen"" i been back 4 times with no problems. good job guys!! 4.5/5 stars"
1-star,0,"called to schedule an oil change appointment. guy on phone was rude and said they didnt take oil appointments for saturdays and to bring it in in the morning. i showed up at 8 am on the dot and asked the guy to call me when it's ready. i waited around until 4:30 pm and still no call. i finally went down there to see if the place had blew up. the guy at the desk said they had just pulled it in. i said wow, thats one long oil change. he looked at me with a blank look and said nothing. i said, i dropped it off at 8am. he replied that they had a lot of oil changes that day and it would be done in 15 minutes. it was finally ready at 5:15pm. rediculous service. this is why you should take appointments. so you can get people their car back to them. an oil change should not take over 9 hours."
1-star,0,"worst service experience ever!! i had fletchers change the brakes on my truck. they will not set up an appointment, rather they have you bring the vehicle in at 7am. i did just that, and didnt receive my truck back until after 3pm and several calls inquiring about the status. doesnt end there. i had to take my truck back 2 months later because the brakes were squealing worse than when i originally brought it in. same story, no appointment, truck dropped off before 9am, and didnt get back until 5pm. on top of that, they try pushing several other items on you. last time i ever use this company for anything."
5-star,1,found a nail in our tire on a sunday - ugh. found this firestone location open and they saw us right away. 45 minutes later and we are on the road again! super nice guys working the counter - enjoyed the chit chat while we were waiting. only cost about $15 which i thought was super reasonable. hopefully we don't need to go here again (no offense!) but i would definitely recommend them.
1-star,0,i took my vehicle there for oil change and redo alignment. first of all they forgot to make my appt so when i showed up they had no record of conversation. so i had to return the next day for my service. they performed alignment for free out of warranty for miscommunication which was awesome. i left and noticed my truck is clunking and my steering wheel is way off. i called and made it in as soon as i could. they found my lower control arm bolts left loose. thanks for everything........ never again
1-star,0,"as for firestone trying to ""save face"" via this yelp comment, forget it. i wrote a long detailed letter to firestone by email immediately after this event. i included names, dates, times, details...etc..... i recieved no reply. my review stands. i have had horrible service from start to finish, and this included the headquarters customers service department who ignored my email."
1-star,0,i have had my daughter's car oil changed there regularly. i was always told they check all the fluids as well. that isn't true at all. very disappointing.
5-star,1,"best customer service i have ever experienced at a auto shop ever!!!!!!! i walked in states my problem, was promptly addressed and the issue was resolved in the time promised. the manager billy went above and beyond to make sure my tire concern was taken care of. from now on i'm going here to address my car concerns. i did view other reviewers and i can't speak on their experiences but based on my one interaction being so amazing i can't see them messing up and not trying to fix the issue and going above and beyond to accommodate. this is personally where i want to go for auto repairs"
1-star,0,"the last time i visited this shop a tool was left in my engine bay by the service guys, i am not sure how it happened but when i opened my hood to take a look it was precariously sitting inside. when i brought this to the shops attention the technician denied ever opening my hood on previous visits however i know this to be un-true because the last service rep told me he noticed my brake fluid needed to be changed due to it looking quite dirty which he could only know by opening my hood. no one tried to rectify the situation or give me any sort of solution or explanation. the technician i spoke to about the issue simply took the tool and asked if i need any other service, if this was not left by your employees why take the tool? previous to this experience i had purchased 4 brand new tires for my vehicle with the warranty from this shop however this sort of treatment seems almost unforgettable. this tool could have fallen into my engine and endangered my life and many others. how can i possibly trust these service technicians again if they cannot seem to remember their own tools?! this is unacceptable and honestly quite frightening."
4-star,1,"auto mechanics you can trust! i would like to thank the folks at firestons. i have used firestone on numerous occasions from oil changes to alignment work and everything in between. the guys at firestone are honest, trustworthy, and always explain what needs to be done, and my vehicles are always repaired in a timely matter. honesty, experience, and expertise are just a few of the attributes at firestone. you can't beat the great customer service, thorough work, and more than fair pricing."
5-star,1,"i have been going here since 2007 for my prius - they are the only ones that are allowed to touch my vehicle. i have had my family use them also. if they are unable to do the work because it is a toyota issue they will tell you. (i had a headlight issue that they were not able to handle, and i had a battery issue that had to go back to toyota) they are very friendly. i have never had a problem with them in the 9 years i have been going to them. i had a previous fleet vehicle also and they did all the oil changes."
1-star,0,"think twice!! and yes i had an appointment !!what was suppose to be a quick oil change & tire rotation turned into a 3.5 hour ordeal. 1...45 min. before they pulled my truck in 2...they couldn't get the lug nuts off my wheels because they were ""messed"" up ( i watched the ""tech"" use the wrong socket to start with) 3... i ask for them to replace the drain plug. the old one was leaking. when i got home i saw an oil leak! i took my truck back to them immediately. drain plug had not been replaced and was loose. i took it out using my fingers!!"
5-star,1,"made an appointment to have their diagnostician look at my jeep. they explained to me that there would be a charge for his time which could not be applied to any service work. ok, i understand that. the technician said that the engine code was showing a misfire in cylinder 6. said my jeep was too new to either have plugs or coils be responsible and said it was most likely a valve problem. said i should go to the dealer because that is part of the drive train and should be covered under warranty. went to the dealer and showed them my paperwork. bottom line...firestone did not charge me and i had $2200 worth of warranty work done, no charge. that is not the first time firestone has not charged me for something and shown that kind of integrity and honesty. i highly recommend this facility!!"
1-star,0,"i have taken my car here a few times now and have been pretty unhappy with the service. the first time i took it in for an oil change and everything was good. the second time i took it in to get my tires rotated and i came home to see that my hub cap had fallen off. luckily it fell off in the parking lot at firestone so i was able to get it back. the next time i came back to get my ac fixed. i had them run all of the tests to see what was wrong. they said it was ""possibly"" the compressor, but they weren't sure. they said i for sure needed the freon evacuated. they did that and had me come pick up my car and said the ac was fixed ($300 later). i drove off and the ac did not work! i brought it back and they looked at it again and said it was the compressor which would be another $600 to fix. i don't understand why they would send me away saying it was fixed! there goes $300 down the drain!"
5-star,1,"once again, the guys here take very good care of me and my truck. the prices are competitive but the service stands out."
1-star,0,"words that describe this shop: dishonest, unethical, incompetent, unfriendly, irresponsible. if your comfortable with taking your much needed transportation and putting into the hands of folks barely capable of spinning marketing signs on the roadside, otherwise try elsewhere for your automotive needs..."
1-star,0,if i could give them no stars i would. i've been going to this location for years but lately the alignment bay has no regard for your vehicle what so ever. they get it in and out fast but at what cost. recently i took my jeep in to get the steering wheel corrected. they fixed the steering wheel but just twisted up the boots on both sides of the rack and pinion witch now both need to be replaced. i would not recommend them at all. sloppy work.
5-star,1,"i've been going to this store for the past 2 years, and its the best service i have ever had! i definitely recommend them, any time i need service on my vehicle i know i can count on them to help me out. the staff there is super friendly and is always willing to lend a helping hand, on one occasion they actually drove me to work so i could make it on time! i really appreciate it guys please keep up the good work!"
5-star,1,great service! got me in and fixed my flat on a sunday afternoon and got me back on the road again. courteous staff and very efficient. they treated all the other waiting customers very well too.
1-star,0,"it has been 38 days now since i took my car into firestone (see my review below). i have a witness to the fact that they forgot to put oil in the car after an oil change and they are still not accepting liability. joey huskey, the manager, lied to me and the assistant manager has been told not to talk to me because he knows they didn't put the oil back in. i just don't understand how a company like this can do something so horrible."
1-star,0,dont believe these guys. they are dishonest and liars. i book an appointment online for next day and call them to confirm my appointment. they told that my appointment is confirm and i can come to service center at 7st & unions hills. when i reached there after 10 miles drive that guy told that my appointment us not confirm and he don't want to argue. i told him that you only asked me to come on phone but he was behaving very rude. they are not known for customer relationship. i dont wanna give them even single star. plz dont believe on firestone people.
5-star,1,"i have been going to this firestone location for more than a decade for service work. over the years the management team and technicians (too complex these days to call them mechanics) overall have done a great job for my family's cars. i am never sold something i don't need. the items i asked to be fixed are addressed during the first visit. no return visits for the same issue. they honor competitor's coupons. invariably the staff is courteous, pleasant and timely with their service."
4-star,1,"picture this, new years eve, driving down bell road and bam, you run over something and your tire goes flat. so you proceed to pull over, beg someone to help you put on the donut so that you an go to the nearest firestone to get it fixed. you walk in and they are busier then heck on this nye. however the friendly guy behind the counter says no problem, we will get you all squared away in about an hour or so.. is that ok? oh and it is only going to cost you $47 as you had warranty on your tire. hmm hell yes that is just fine. they were friendly, helpful, and they let me know about a few more issues that i may want to check on at my next oil change, but i was in and out before they closed at 5pm. thank you again for squeezing me in and taking good care of me."
5-star,1,the service is fast and friendly. they always tell you exactly what is wrong or needs to be repaired and they also give you advance notice on things that may need to be checked on in the coming months. i feel they are fairly priced and honest about the work that they do.
5-star,1,"every time i bring my car in, everyone is so professional and courteous. they have competitive prices and they know customer service- even the young techs! and they educated me on how to take better care of my tires so they'd last longer. they'll also check the air pressure at no charge. love them."
5-star,1,"great customer service is hard to come by, and yesterday i encountered one of the best customer service experiences i have had in an automotive store. most times, the guy behind counter is there ""just for the job"" and ""just trying to get my money"" but not this time. my experience was professional courteous, and ultimately he was genuinely concerned for the value of the money i was spending. you have a great asset in vince miller, managers like him are like a needle in a haystack. thank you and i will continue to send my friends and family to see him."
1-star,0,i had use these guys for many years everything seemed to be fine and my vehicle had a ticking engine noise they proceeded to tell me that my truck was on its way out that i overheated my engine and that the truck was not worth fixing a year later my truck is still working no ticking they just didn't care or they didn't know or they don't know what they're doing or all of the above they want to get you in and out and do a half subpar job disappointing very very very
1-star,0,"very disappointed with fletcher's (now firestone). i made an appointment 2 weeks ago for a brake job. i specified when i made the appointment brakes. after the oil change today, fletcher's called and said they didn't have time to do my brakes today. i'd have to bring my car back another day. they have wasted 2 weeks of my time when i could have gone elsewhere and been done with it. i wonder if it has anything to do with the coupon i submitted? i'm assuming they didn't want to honor it. we will not be returning to this place. i suggest patrons go elsewhere too."
2-star,0,"took my car in for an oil change last week. a week later, i pull out of my garage and forget something in the house so i park in the driveway. i walk back in the garage on my way inside the house to see a 2'x1' slick of fresh oil. immediately call to take my car in. my car did not leak oil prior to the oil change. sure enough, they had not fully tightened something down. perhaps the staff is overworked? not sure. they fixed it right away, but the fact is, my engine could have seized from lack of oil and i was left with a huge mess to clean up in my garage. it makes me not trust that fletcher's double-checks their work before releasing the vehicles. used to really rely on fletchers too. bummer."
1-star,0,"so rude. i was not greeted as i entered; as a matter of fact they acted as if i was interrupting them from just standing around. yes they did give me a better price then the previous place to get my headlight replaced, but still i don't care if i am spending $ 10 or $100 it's my money and i want to feel like the person provide me service appreciates it. after all i work hard for mine!"
1-star,0,took my tire to get a patch and it took over 4 hours to fix . i mean come on if you tell me my tire will be ready in 1 hour. i get there 3 hours later and they didn't even start on it!!. they might look busy but no one is working. it's worse then the dmv . never again i'm going to discount tires it's worth the wait there.
5-star,1,"gary at fletcher's was great! i rolled in with a flat tire that needed to be ordered, which i thought would take at least a day.... my tire arrived 2 hours later and the service took 20 minutes! quick service and fair price."
1-star,0,"do not get your car fixed at fletcher's! i went in for an oil change and tire rotation and they forgot to screw my lug nuts back on . they let me drive away with my children in the car. driving down cave creek road, i realized there was a problem. the tire was coming off and all the bolts and lugs were bent. the manager fixed the problem right way. i tried to be understanding because things can be overlooked and we were not injured. i gave them a second chance by having my shocks and struts replaced. after picking it up, i heard a strange grinding noise under my car. i brought it back and they told me it was probably something simple that had come loose. but in all actuality, they had broken one of my axles and let me drive off with my children in the car again. we could have been seriously hurt! they knew they had made a serious mistake and were trying to cover their tracks. they replaced the axle but i still did not trust the work and took it to toyota for a complete check up. worst of all, i have called corporate several times to complain. no one has bothered to call me back. i am not looking to get anything, i just want to make sure they have better safety checks for future customers. i fear that another family will have negligent service and get in an accident. i will never go to another fletcher's again!"
5-star,1,"i've been a customer for over 15 years and have taken many different kinds of vehicles to their shop. always honest, fair pricing and great to work with, and i've worked with everyone in the shop. no doubt that i would absolutely recommend them for tires or service."
1-star,0,"i made an appointment, showed up 15 minutes early for it, had the car checked in and was told the alignment would take around 45 minutes to an hour. an hour later i walk back from home depot, my car was still in the same spot in their forecourt. i lined up in order to ask if it was finished - they hadn't even started it. there was an air of general confusion and lack of communication. the car was eventually seen to, and i left unhappy. apart from agreeing with the reasons for my dissatisfaction, the manager seemed to be completely at ease with the lack of customer service. i won't bother returning."
5-star,1,great customer service! quick in and out and there is a wonderful starbucks nextdoor! i didn't even have time to finish my coffee! very pleasant experience would highly recommend!
5-star,1,always great service and super friendly. i would recommend this location. they never overcharge and they always try to save me as much money as possible. not to mention the rewards for using them are great.
5-star,1,very professional and speedy to boot! service advisor was knowledgable and communicated great! he smelled good too! great experience!
1-star,0,worst experiences ever. gave this place three tries and way too much money. now i have to go to the dealer to get it fixed. customer service is extinct there. i went as far as calling headquarters and that was also a waste of time. don't go here!! if i could give zero stars i would.
1-star,0,"horrible! they told me a blower and resistor to fix my broken a/c would take 1 hour! a/c went out when it was 115 degrees so i felt i had no choice....even though i had my 2.5yr old grandson with me. they took 4 and a half hours! my grandson fell asleep in my arms (30lbs) so that made a long situation uncomfortable. but i am not done yet, next they claimed they couldn't run my credit card because it was a debit card. next, they drobe me to chase, who couldn't cash it because i don't have an account there. long horrible story short- i had no choice but to ask my boss to pay over the phone. so embarrassing! i don't believe in credit cards. i pay cash! no debt so lesson learned! but 4.5 hrs was not reasonable! bad service so i hope their ""warranty"" doesn't need to be exercised. never going back!"
5-star,1,i have been coming to this location for several years...always good service and fair prices !! and i just wait at the starbucks next door ! greg is friendly and professional.
2-star,0,"i live within walking distance of this joint or i would never go back. i dropped my car for an oil change, tire rotation/balance at 0830. at 3:30 that afternoon i called to check status, still not ready and oh by the way i need new shocks and struts. i probably do need these things but could they not call a sister earlier in the day so i could have ok'd it. then they tell me that the shocks and struts that they put in last time weren't really the good ones (like i know the difference). so the lifetime warranty that i was sold on when i ok'd that service is only good if i put the same (substandard) equipment in, equipment that they sell. it's maddening going in there, i'd rather have a monthly pap smear than go there twice a year."
1-star,0,"stay away from these guys. terrible customer service! i purchased a tire from here, and at first my credit card declined because of a mix up at the bank from a deposit i made this am. my fault partly on the bank situation, because i misunderstood how much they were going to release.. long story short, the guy was a jerk about it when i told them that the money was available the following day. (the tire they put on was on my a-6 high performance 2015 vehicle), and his best response is ""you're not leaving with that tire"", and when i told him, i could leave him something of value that he knows i will be back and he's like nope, can't do it.. i ended up using a business card, but the way they handled it, if that is indicative of how they do their business tells me allot."
1-star,0,"not a good place. called and made an appointment for 2pm to install tires i purchased online and had shipped to their store. first off they never bothered to call me to let me know the tires arrived, which every other place i have done this did. second, i arrived on time, and they never wrote down the appointment they scheduled with me and told me it would be 2 hours to place my tires because they were booked up at 2pm. i then had to have someone pick me up because i could not wait the 2 hours. they said they would call when finished, and like everything else they never called. the gentleman running the cashier seems very indifferent, does not listen at all, and has very poor customer service skills as evident by the many other dissatisfied people in their lobby. i would avoid this repair shop at all costs."
1-star,0,"good deal on package of oil changes. but every oil change they call with a list of problems, maintenance issues to add on. every time. just took car in to have brakes looked at. $800 bill to replace all the rotors and pads. the rotors have never been turned before. my wife got a call from them a couple of years ago, recommended she get all the fluids flushed with the oil change. she couldn't get in touch with me at work and ok'd it. $750. flush the brake fluid! douche bags, so i see why the deal is on oil changes. screw you every other chance they can......"
2-star,0,"this place is a rib off. took my car in because i had a coupon. i even had an appt, but the still made me sit and wait 20 min. when finish, you would not believe all the things ""they"" found wrong with my car! i took it into honda, and low and behold none of the items on fletcher's list needed to be replaced! horrible! guess since i was a female, they were trying to take advantage of me. when it comes to cars, why do think it's only a mans world out there????"
5-star,1,"it was a mission to find a moving company to work with because i knew other people would be handing my grandmother's things. my reason for picking this one was because a friend of mine had given me their contact info. she actually just moved herself from a studio to a 1-bedroom. i was moving my grandmother into a bigger place that was closer to her daughter. it was more towards the city and i wanted to make sure that she could be fully moved in by saturday, the day of my move because i had to leave that night. this company had made sure that they were able to meet our time frame and had explained their packing services. they took care of everything. disassembled all of the furniture to make it easier to transport, made sure to put protection over every piece, and loaded it all nicely into the truck. same thing was for unloading except opposite and she was all set up early that night. moving is a long and tiring process and i definitely am not a fan of it, but they did a great job of taking care of my grandma and providing us with great customer service."
5-star,1,"within the last few weeks we had been increasingly worried about how this move is going to be done. we called a few different places but none of them felt like the right fit, until we called flat price and we realized that these were definitely the right guys to work with. the entire process took just over a week to complete and this included the shipping as well, would totally recommend these guys to any of our friends and family in the area that need help for a move."
5-star,1,"i was moving out of school, & i was not very excited about the idea of having to lug all my stuff around. flat price moving took all of the hassle out of the entire experience. the movers were super polite & professional when handling my items. everything got there safe & sound, and they even helped me arrange the furniture inside of my new apartment. i'd use them again if i could!"
5-star,1,"i have used flat price moving & auto shipping twice now, and both experiences were fantastic. the first time was a new years day move from a 4 bedroom townhouse to a 3 story condo. they came in under the estimate, set everything up and were great. the second time, this past week, was also excellent. i kept telling them i had no idea where they got their energy from. they again came in under the estimate. i was so stressed out with my move, the house buying process etc. and by the time move day came around, i was exhausted. it was so great to have these guys come in and just take care of things - huge peace of mind. they helped me move furniture around too so it was where i wanted it before they left. excellent all around, i would highly recommend them."
5-star,1,"no one can deny that moving is truly not one of the fun parts about relocating, however we have learned that with the right help the transition into a new home and new city, can be made smoother. i contacted flat price after dealing with a previous company local to cleveland did not work out. they were understanding of my situation and offered me a deal due to the size of my move. expediting the move was not an issue for them, however, the price might be a little costier because they need to speed up the entire process of packaging and transporting. nevertheless, it posed no issue to them and they were able to deliver all of our things on schedule. will definitely use again."
5-star,1,"got rear ended in our 2018 dodge durango. took it into franks for repairs. got a very fast and reasonable estimate, easy drop off, easy pickup. very friendly service. no shady mechanic business. larry was very courteous during the process. i'm pretty sure they washed and vacuumed it while they had it. very satisfied overall. we recommend and will be return customers."
3-star,0,the work at frank's auto body is awesome. i am highly satisfied with the repair and paint job. however i experienced some downfall. i dropped my car off june 5 with an estimated date of june 8. when i called on june 7 i was told my they were waiting on allstate. i was given the new estimated ready date of june 12. it wasn't until june 14 i was able to pick up my car and was told the missing rubber piece would be in the next day. when returning the rental car on the 14 to enterprise i was charged the additional 2 days since allstate denied the extension from franks which i was told by franks they don't cover rentals. i called frank's last week for an update on the missing rubber piece (currently has red and white clips on the roof of my car). i was told tuesday the part had not came in yet and which i called thursday no answer. i must say this month has been a nightmare between allstate and the shop. i feel like it's been alot of miscommunication.
5-star,1,"i know from past experience some body repair shops can be pretty shady. not this one! franks service rep lisa made this trip to the body shop a pleasurable one. she kept all of her promises,kept me informed,job was done on time and most importantly our gmc truck looks perfect again! they even took care of all communication with our insurance company. i would highly recommend franks to family or friends. excellent customer service and we will return if needed!"
5-star,1,my wife took her van in to have her van repaired after an accident. they did such an awesome job. then we started to notice that one door was starting to drag off the slide. so we called up franks and they were able to fix it without any issues. we highly recommend this body shop over all in vegas. they are quick and very efficient and they do awesome work. plus frank is an awesome guy and very knowledgeable in the auto body industry and was able to answer every question we had. awesome place!!!!! 5 stars all the way.
5-star,1,"the staff here is so kind and helpful. debby and frank are very personable and will do anything to guide you and your car in the right direction. i have gotten calls from joel on giving me updates about my car. i can't appreciate this staff enough. front desk staff such as vivian; always smiling and willing to help in any way possible. i lost all hope when i got into a wreck but the moment i got my car back, it felt like i was getting it brand new. the technicians did such an amazing job. thank you frank's auto body. definitely a place to take your car if you need anything done on it."
5-star,1,"got rear ended in my new car on the expressway. 10k worth of damage! frank's was recommended to me by a friend who is also a car nut. brought my my car to frank's and worked with jorge. told him the car had to come back to me ""perfect"". one month later, it did!!!! absolutely top shelf work. among the best body work i have ever seen. fabulous customer service. jorge called me weekly to keep me up to date on the repairs! cant say enough good things about frank's auto body and jorge. it doesn't get any better than this!! mike s. henderson"
5-star,1,"frank's is second to none! my wife and i have both had our vehicles worked on at frank's and they have always done an amazing job! not only is the quality and thoroughness of the auto body work great, but frank and the office staff are fabulous! wouldn't take our vehicles anywhere else."
5-star,1,"dropped my daughter's car off on monday for minor paint & bumper repair and received it today(thursday!) lisa was our coordinator & was extremely polite & helpful. i was delighted at the cost as we were paying out-of-pocket! if you need body repair, frank's is your place!"
5-star,1,"there isn't much to say about a body shop that does it right. i've been to frank's on both sides of an accident, and regardless of whether i'm at-fault or not they are great to work with. the most important part: the vehicles i get back are always in better-than-before-the-accident condition. as in, even before i needed a body shop and my car was ""undamaged"", it wasn't in as good shape as it will be when frank's returns it. the staff is friendly, the estimators are thorough and communicate well throughout the entire process, and any questions are answered with a simple phone call that is always quickly returned if not answered immediately. i will continue to use them for everything i need until i move away or they change ownership."
5-star,1,my 18 year old daughter and i were scheduled to meet for lunch. on the way she stopped for gas and while filling up was side-swiped by a boat trailer. she had never been involved in a collision before and called me freaking out. i calmed her down and recommended that she call frank's. she got her appointment at a time that worked best for her and everything was taken care of for her by frank and his staff. she learned a lot through this situation and will now know what to do should it ever happen again.
5-star,1,franks auto body does amazing work. they are also very courteous and friendly. they gave me an estimate and time schedule for the repair work that was spot on. they also called me to keep me updated on the work their staff is very friendly and even called the rental car office to get me picked up from their shop by the rental car company. best of all my car looks brand new. i would highly recommend this place to anyone who wants great work and great service. thank you
1-star,0,"i went to franks to get an estimate to paint my truck. when i arrived there was no on at the counter. i greeted the receptionists and stated that i wanted an estimate to paint my truck. she snapped ""do you want to paint the whole truck"" i said i believe so and she said we don't do that. i asked why do you only do insurance claims. she replied in a very condescending manner well it would be over $5000 and we would have to keep it a very long time. now keep in mind nobody had even looked at the truck or asked what kind of truck. it was more than evident that they had no intent to help me. i have had work done at franks before and i have recomended them to others. after the attitude and lack of help i ran into i will never use them or recommendthem ever again."
5-star,1,"i have used frank's three times, two parking lot accidents that were my fault and last week, one that was not. they are always friendly and professional, and i have never had to wait. the repairs look perfect and they returned my car cleaner than when i dropped it off! hopefully, i won't see them again for a while but they eliminate all the stress for me when dealing with these situations. dennis was awesome as usual!! my insurance is usaa and i used enterprise to rent a car and that was great, they picked me up and dropped me off. thanks for making things easy frank's!"
1-star,0,"i called to schedule an estimate appointment on thursday 11/12/15, repair is being paid by statefarm (the adverse carrier that rear ended me) what upsets me is i requested franks auto body because i have lived in las vegas since college 1981. i was told the soonest they could schedule was 1.30p monday 11/16/15, i agreed. on mon 11/16/15 i arrived at 1.23p front door was locked due to high winds not an issue but you will understand as the story goes on. the sign said use employee entrance, i did, you enter from behind the receptionist desk and walk in from behind the counter, i was immediately asked to fill out a one page form i did and handed it in at 1.25p five minutes before my scheduled appointment. i the sat down in the waiting room, small about six seats 15 by 20 size room. i am the only person sitting less than ten feet from the receptionist desk we are facing each other. at 1.55p i walked up to the receptionist (who never left the room the complete time i was there alone no other customers the whole time) and told her i am appalled at there lack of service and making me wait 25 minutes past my scheduled appointment. her response was ""no one took care of you?"" how can she ask that question she never left the room and the only way to get to me was past her desk and counter because the customer door was looked due to the wind. i was so upset for the lack of empathy i walked out and drove 16 miles back to my office. as i was walking to my office tony from frank's called me and said ""i was on the phone with an insurance company, i apologize, can you come back"" his tone was as if the insurance company was bad and they made him late. he should have said i dropped the ball and missed your appointment. i said i just drove round trip over 30 miles i find you excuse unacceptable. tony said all i can do is apologize. i advised that is not enough and hung up. i know frank's has been in business for over 30 years and has come highly recommended from customers (and me). i am sure frank will say that if he chooses to respond to this. in closing i have socially recommend franks for over 20 years to friends and family. they just repaired my friends 2014 white subaru forester (rear bumper and tail lens) two weeks ago because i sent her there. i will never recommend them again and i will tell my story at every social event i am at when bad service or where should i repair my vehicle comes up. it appears they have become so big over the last 30 years they could care less how i or any individual feels."
5-star,1,"just picked up my car from frank's auto body. it looks better than the day i bought it! with rear end damage on a 2004 vehicle, the color match was right on. other blemishes and the headlights were buffed out and my car looks amazing. from the estimate to the finished product, i was treated as though my happiness was their only concern. the entire staff had the forethought to prepare me for what i could expect. i felt comfortable leaving my car in the hands of professionals. i was provided transportation to and from the shop. the driver and i shared a few laughs that made the trip pleasant. lisa and the office gals graciously tended to my business in a timely and cheerful manner. thank you, frank. i wish you and your business all the blessings that i have experienced because of our acquaintance."
5-star,1,"my experience with frank's auto body was nothing but phenomenal. i went in after i was told by the vw dealership that in order to fix my taillight from popping out they would have to remove the entire rear bumper for over $100+. lisa was amazing! she came out to my car, popped the trunk and immediately found the problem. she took a picture in order to consult with someone in the shop and then explained to me that i needed a specialized bolt that was designed to avoid removing the bumper and even showed me the bolt on the other taillight. then not only did she order the part for me, she also offered to install it herself for free. the cost of the part was less than $5 and it took 2 minutes to fix. even more than that, she was so polite and helpful that when i tried to tip her generously she graciously refused (3 times!) explaining how her primary goal is to help and it was enough to know that i was a satisfied customer. i know this was a minor issue, but based on this experience i would never hesitate to return or recommend frank's. lisa deserves a gold star of excellence, i'm very grateful for all of her help. fyi i was originally referred to them by sunset auto imports service down the road, and when i thanked them for the referral due to my positive experience they said that they consistently hear positive feedback from clients they have referred there."
5-star,1,"i want to thank franks auto body for taking such good care of me & my car. i also want to thank lisa for her impeccable customer service & keeping me updated frequently. there work is excellent & the prices are fair! my experience with this company was above excellence! i would absolutely recommend franks auto body, in henderson, nv!"
1-star,0,"had my vehicle painted, through a recommendation ......let me tell u it was a nightmare!!! to this day the paint on the vehicle is cracking, not to mention when i picked up the vehicle the first two times it had numerous runs and drips throughout the vehicle. the sales person i was working with ( dennis ) had no clue about what was going on, kept giving me the run around with my problems and was literally no help. do not waste your money las vegas, there are plenty other shops out there that are worth your time and money!!!!!"
5-star,1,"a couple of years ago i was in an accident and state farm found this place for me. my estimator was tom, who was extremely helpful. he worked with me on the cost to replace something my insurance company wouldn't pay for 100%. i was very pleased with the work they did. would you believe this time all i needed was a headlight replaced and took it to 2 places that wouldn't do it because they said it was time consuming, expensive, and could only be done at dealers. i decided to visit tom before going to lexus, who set up a day and time for me to come back. within 10 minutes of arrival, tom had done the work at no cost to me. i am very surprised to read negative reviews but highly recommend tom to be your estimator."
5-star,1,"deserves 6 stars! i recently had my car repaired at frank's auto body after damaging the front end and hood. the estimate given by lisa was very reasonable and everyone i dealt with was so nice. they kept me informed on the progress every step of the way, which i greatly appreciated. the best part was when i picked up my car yesterday and it looks brand new! i am so pleased with how amazing the car looks...it's as if the accident never happened. i will never get a car repaired anywhere else. frank's is the best!"
1-star,0,"no. i wouldn't recommend this place at all. my minivan was rear ended by a drunk drive on the freeway and the workmanship was bad. we had to keep sending it back but they wouldn't fix the issue. we finally gave up. its bad when you get your car back with panels not lined up correctly inside and bird poop on your seat! where was quality control? we brought the car back for the front drivers door not closing right and they never fixed it. they did fix some other issues but it seemed very selective and the bigger issues were never corrected. i told them to check the transmission because of the accident and they said it was fine. guess what we had to have the dealer replace one year later? the worse part is their location. if you live on the west side of town, go somewhere else. you will save lots of time and money not having to bring your car back over and over and over... the van should have been totaled. i know it would have been at another shop. re: the owners comment about my mistaking them for another shop, no i did not."
5-star,1,dennis was outstanding when it came to keeping me informed about my vehicle when it was in the shop. he dealt with the insurance company and the rental car for me. they did an awesome job and i would diffinitely use them again. my car looks great. thank you dennis.
1-star,0,"frank is just not a standup guy. he told me he was charging for a $65 diagnostic and actually charged me $147. i was stunned. i asked him why he increased the amount and told him i didn't approve of any increases. i then asked him if he thought that was fair, and he responded, ""you goddamn right i think it's fair."" that in of itself says enough. it's unfortunate my $147 went to fund a bunch of crooks."
5-star,1,took my 2013 mazda here that had front front end damage. got referred here from some family members so had high expectations. i was constantly receiving updates which was great. car looks like it never had any damage and they did it much faster than i thought.
4-star,1,"i heard this place is great and they deal with a lot of contracts for different agencies, so i wanted to check them out. plus, usaa contracts w/them for estimates. they did keep my car longer than expected. paint was not great the first time i got my car back after 4 days at their shop, but they did tell me to bring it back and they would take care of it. i brought it back and the paint work was not coming out to their standards. frank, the owner, did get involved and decided he didn't like how the paint turned out so he wanted to keep my car longer. they put me in a rental car, which they paid for, and made sure when i got the car back, it was done correctly! they called their paint specialist to check it out and help them out. sometimes things it don't go exactly how it's planned, but it's the service when something does go wrong. you can rely on them to make it right and they take full responsibility. it's no wonder frank is well known and has been around for 30+ years... i read the post about back mechanics and incompetent painters, but i will tell you, it's ultimately frank who makes the call and he will do what it takes to make it right. overall, i was taken care of. was a hassle and that is why i don't give them 5 stars, but it's how frank handled the situation did i want to give them great reviews. i know others that have taken their cars here from my work and rave about this place and have had good results. the estimator could have been a little more up front with me about the timing and situation because he did not point out the paint issue when i picked it up the first time. however, he did agree with me when i showed him the issue. the estimator did allow me to bring it back to make it right. i know had it been frank himself from the beginning, it wouldn't have gotten that far. things happen and i am glad to have my car back with no problems :) paint looks great!"
5-star,1,"i was in an accident a few months back, and my insurance company recommended frank's. it was my first accident, and i was terrified about navigating the insurance and repair process. frank's was wonderful. dennis was my adjuster, and he called twice a week without fail the entire four weeks it was in the shop to let me know about the progress. any time my dad or i called with questions, he was available, super friendly, and very thorough in his answers. the final total was higher than the initial adjustment, but that was because my insurance company had them put factory parts on instead of after market parts. the work was flawless, and i haven't had a problem since. i love my car, and it's great to see it back in shape when i was initially convinced it was totaled. other than the inconvenience of not having a car, the process was completely painless. i can't recommend this place enough, both for their work and great customer service."
5-star,1,recently took my car in to frank's and had an amazing experience. the people were courteous and the work was top notch.
5-star,1,"they have reasonable prices, great service and finally an auto body shop that keeps you up to date on your vehicle and keeps their promise time for the return of your vehicle."
5-star,1,"i worked for frank's ten years ago and was impressed with the quality. in the business many techs say he's the hardest boss, but these are the techs that like to cut corners. being in the business and even a competitor at times with frank, i accord him the highest honors in the business. he's only one of two body shops i recommend in las vegas."
5-star,1,"frank is awesome. my family's been taking our cars to him for repair since the beginning of time. his estimates always come in lowest and his and his team's work is always the best. back in my younger days, i was a car wreckin' fool. the fact that i'm stil alive is a testament to the patience of my parents. frank always fixed us up quickly and we never had a problem with any of his work. it wasn't until i got my own car with my own insurance and found out i had to go to someone else to get the work covered that i really realized how great this place is. it might be out in henderson, but if you want your car fixed right you'll make the trip."
5-star,1,"****better than any other car wash***** you cannot beat the price of $7.00. the car wash is exterior only with a person who ""preps"" your car using a brush and soapy water and someone else dries your car. they do have self service vacuums onsite. our car was loaded with bugs from a road trip. the nice young man who ""preps"" your car noticed how bad our car was and gave our car extra attention to get the bugs off. our car was completely bug free! something the overpriced full service car washes never do. this was our first time here and will now always use this carwash."
5-star,1,"after a week of sitting in the hot henderson sun, my bug splattered dusty car needed a bath before the return trip back to ca. i yelped the closest gas and car wash and found this place. it's actually a chevron station with premium gas under $3 a gallon. what made it special was this quick little car wash had the sweetest guy prewashing and drying afterwards. your choice of washes, $7, $9, or $12. pay for it with your gas then use the code from your receipt for the carwash. i just handed it to the car wash guy and he punched it in. don't forget to tip these guys working out in that hot sun. they also had bonus point for vons and albertsons customers. not sure how that works. there's many gas pumps so no waiting and it's in the shade! located in front of the post office on st. rose parkway near eastern. you can exit behind the post office to get back to eastern and then head toward the highway. one stop for all your road trip needs. aux cord in, radar on, starbucks mocha frappuccino, beef jerky, nuts, and cold water, we're out of here!"
5-star,1,"we are from southern california and drove to las vegas for a weekend stay. my car was filthy - bug splatters and bird droppings from the drive. and, i have a white car. after breakfast, we went yelping for a good drive through carwash. get and go did not disappoint. my car was pre-washed, washed, then hand dried by a couple young men. get and go plus the 2 gentlemen did a fantastic job. my car was sparkling. i am so happy with get and go's results!"
4-star,1,"i frequent this chevron quite often since it's near my house. this is a one-stop shop gas station. there are plenty of pumps open with space to drive around. you can get a car wash once you've pumped your gas. and if it's that time of the year for you, there's a smog testing station off to the side. there are plenty of snacks and drinks for purchase inside the convenient store. and the employees i've talked to are pretty friendly. most importantly, it's clean and well lit, so i feel safe. two thumbs up!"
5-star,1,"great car wash. easy drive though and you can pay for the wash at the pump when getting gas. the guys that work there do a great job at scrubbing the car before and drying it off afterwards. also, the vacuums work very well and you don't have to pay extra to use them. this will definitely be my new car wash spot. great value. the cheapest wash is $7, then $9 and most expensive is $12."
5-star,1,i go to this gas station very frequently! the ladies that work the counter are very nice and make going here a delight. whenever i walk in they greet me with a hello and ask how i'm doing. when i'm paying they bag up the items very quickly and willingly help me with anything i need. i will continue to come to this gas station! very nice people and place !!
1-star,0,"you don't take gift cards? why not? their satellite is down, they don't take gift cards... they were giving another woman a hard time when i walked in to get my change from having to pay cash. i announced to her, it's not you, it's this place! then the arrogant manager in a red shirt says- ""oh ya the satellites down!"" after i said it to them... what is it with men and establishments acting incapable? she thanked me and i thanked worker amazing man benny for apologizing. i vote benny as manager, and get the other guy into kindness classes."
5-star,1,has excellent service if a 24/7 private lounge of video poker basically on the side wasn't enough. they have doughnuts inside the store served daily.
4-star,1,"this gas station is right down the street from where i work. my boyfriend likes coming here to get his gas. i usually go to another one. there is a car wash here but we haven't tried it. for those who are looking for a smog place, you're in luck because located here is a jiffy smog. and, like most gas stations, there are video poker machines here. the gentleman who works here during the overnight is such a nice guy. he always says hi, thank you, and bye and i think he actually means it. lol."
1-star,0,"i bought a cheese stuffed pretzel yesterday. i had a mouthful of raw dough, not what you want to eat ever. the managers should do some sort of quality control when it comes to food sitting under a heat lamp. the outside of the pretzel was done but not the inside."
1-star,0,"was there late this morning. there is a guy jason in the kitchen area that is ignorant, rude, and just plain out disgraceful. the way he talk to the customer in front of us and the way he talks to the employees is just astonishing. when i asked who his boss is, cause i was not happy with the way he was. he told me ""to leave his store. he is in charge and to get out"". i said i asked you for your bosses name. he screamed get out now. never again will i step foot in this location. getgo needs to rethink what they stand for. customer service is horrible in this store and i will be filling a complaint with the higher ups. beware and take your business elsewhere if he is allowed to do this stuff to people. has anyone else dealt with him?"
2-star,0,"this place definitely has a great snack selection and the main area is cleaner than what some reviews make it out to be. however, i ordered chicken fingers and from the ""kitchen,"" which took about 25 minutes and are about as gas station as you could get. unfortunately, there are also a few distinct people that hang around outside at night (that they don't seem to care about), but this might also be a negative externality from the ""gentlemen's club"" next door."
1-star,0,"pros: to be here you actually have be alive... and being alive is a good thing. cons: 1. i think it all starts with the spatial reasoning test you need to pass in order to either find a parking spot or place to get gas. i'd say the mensa committee would save a lot on test costs if they just had candidates show up here and tell them to try to find the best way to find their parking spot. then it all deteriorates rapidly upon going inside. 2. depending on the time of day (read: after midnight) you run into some real characters... and by characters i mean drunken morons. places like this getgo are precisely the reason why this area of pittsburgh needs more after-hours fast-food dining options - to avoid having to stand next to drunken morons. 3. the service absolutely stinks! i went here after a penguins game to pick up some food. huge mistake. i ordered, paid a remarkably unfriendly cashier, and proceeded to wait. and wait... and wait. and at some point i realized i solved the hodge conjecture so i just left without my food to claim my prize. actually, i didn't solve the hodge conjecture, but i did leave without my food because i waited 20 minutes and had enough. avoid this place like the plague."
3-star,0,"this place is always rockin'. customer service is decent and they carry beer. the parking lot is a mess because there are so many cars. i mean so many cars. seriously when i walk or bike over i have to be careful that i don't get run over. getgo sandwiches are ok too; nothing compares to sheetz though. i do like having getgo close by for last minute, in a hurry kind of stuff."
2-star,0,"getgo in general is fine. i have to agree with everyone that this location is not good. it's a busy location so is packed all the time...but just the parking lot. the store does not seem as busy as i'd expect. the store is defintiely not busy enough to warrant the incredibly long time it takes for mto food. they usually mess up at least something with the food but since we get it to go and eat it at home or somewhere else, it's too late to do anything about it. checking out is okay, but they never seem to have enough cashiers. the store is clean and things are stocked so that's all right. it's better than nothing, but i really recommend other getgo stores over this one."
2-star,0,"getgo is great. this getgo is not. i am certain this is the busiest gas station in the city, and with a very small parking lot in a very high traffic part of town, it is always one step away from a fender bender just to get into a parking space. and if you think you're going to get into a pump without circling at least twice...good luck. the air pump is often broken, and the women's restroom is really really in need of a cleaning. i mean the type of cleaning with a power washer :( my overall impression is they just can't handle the incredibly high traffic and amount of customers that the larger getgo can manage. take a deep breath if you have to use this gas station...you're going to need a fill up of patience."
3-star,0,the service has gotten a lot better since what looks a new manager took over. i am usually there very early morning and past encounters have been awful. one example. clerk behind counter was always flirting with guys and getting or giving out her number. totally ignoring orders. she hasn't been there in last month or so and service has gotten a lot better. i get my order in less than ten minutes. not 25.
4-star,1,"well i hate to bash or to give a bad rating to a convenient store because its all about speed and getting customers in and out without any hinderance or long waiting periods... but i just got 2 hotdogs and a hashbrown to go. and once i got home 15 mins later and ready to eat my food. i didnt even want to take a bite of my hotdogs. they were nasty looking. over cooked or had been sitting on the cooker for far too long to be served to a paying customer. i wouldnt even mi d if they were a little over cooked. but i attempted to eat them anyway because i was hungry. and it was hard just trying to pierce through the over cooked hotdogs! it was like trying to chew rubber! sure i was in and with good timing but id rather wait an additional few minutes for fresh or atleast edible food. sorry that i woke the cook up who really didnt display any interaction with me as i asked if she needed to see my reciept. just seemed miserable. hopefully this was a onetime occurance? order #1044....6:20am....after posting this review i called the store and talked to the manager janet. she was very kind, hospitable and professional. she is the reason why i will continue to do business with getgo. hence the reason i changed my rating from 2 stars to 4. thank you janet."
3-star,0,"i have to be craving a coke pretty bad to venture into this parking freak show. you can see the intensity, bordering on rage, as people jockey for position in their parking lot. the store itself is fine, as long as you decide not to give up and keep circling, circling, circling......."
1-star,0,"this review is for this getgo only. i hate this getgo. during the day it is nearly impossible to get on a pump. cars will back up 3 and 4 waiting for a pump. this also makes navigating through the parking lot a complete exercise in stunt driving between cats sitting, randomly and suddenly moving to try and get to a soon to vacate pump or just pedestrians playing frogger through the lot. then trying to get out either exit on baum or morewood is no picnic either. this though is only a mild irritant. my major complaint is when you try to go here during the later hours. after dark this place becomes absolutely horrendous. first when you park outside you will be accosted by very aggressive ""beggars"". i use this term loosely because begging implies some level of humility. these urchins are downright threatening. and there is usually several of them. then you get inside just to find people sleeping in the store or just watching tv. the worst part, they are clearly not customers and they smell. i refuse to spend any time or money at this location. i have so many other choices for gas and shopping i don't need to waste and time or money here."
1-star,0,"so i came into this get go just to get a smoothie. i ordered (super berry 20oz with yogurt) i ordered a 16oz version as well. when the employee with the large frow made the second smoothie i noticed that they were in the same sized cup. (there's a dollar different with sizes). so i told the large frow guy that he made the same sizes he was instantly ignorant with me. i asked if i could get the proper size cup and he said sorry it's a corporate thing (in a very rude manner). i confronted the manager and he reluctantly made the proper sized smoothie. it tastes horrible. i think i would hate to know what he might have done to it. all in all i am a regular customer, as i work at the pepboys down the street and am now burdened that i may never go to get go again."
1-star,0,easily the worst get go i've been to. lazy and often ambivalent help struggle to make even the simplest of sandwiches properly. seriously don't understand how any of them keep their jobs. stick to the nightmare of getting gas in the tiny lot and avoid the nightmare of getting food.
2-star,0,"if you like tetris then you will love this getgo. seriously, it is like a strategic game every time i try to pull into this parking lot. there is unfortunately not enough space for the amount of traffic this location gets. this location is like any other getgo with the normal pumps, but the store area is a mini market district with some made to order items if you're on the go. overall this getgo is in a great location, but i wish there was a solution to help with the high volume of traffic it receives, which ultimately leads to my rating."
1-star,0,"i absolutely hate this gas station. first off, it's hard to maneuver here. the layout is just horrible. cars are always coming and going. and secondly you would think since this is giant eagle related, any sale that they have would be the same as the stores. for example, windshield washer fluid was 2 for $5. i didn't need 2, so one should have been $2.50. oh no...not here. they told me that since it wasn't ge, i would need to purchase both for the sales price. nope, not me. so i left."
2-star,0,"i have to agree with other reviewers--this place is a pita to get in and out of, including by foot or bike. given that i don't own a car anymore, i wasn't even aware that this place existed until a couple of months ago. however, this place has one thing and one thing only that attracts me: a redbox. as far as i know, this is the closest redbox to my apt., and thus, a convenient stop if i have a friend over for a movie, but i didn't prepare by ordering something from the library ahead of time. one time, i also bought ice cream, but i don't recall having any problems checking out. i've never ordered mto food here, since there are approximately a thousand better places to get quick, cheap food in the neighborhood (also, being from de, i have high standards for mto convenience food thanks to wawa. don't even ask me about sheetz, since i haven't tried theirs yet). regardless of how you're accessing this place, i implore you to be careful--it's just as easy to get run over here as a pedestrian as it is to get slammed into in your car, due to the poor design. 2.5 stars."
2-star,0,"i am normally scared to get gas here because it's always so busy and the parking lot is a total disaster. getting in and out of this parking lot can be a nightmare. don't even think about trying to make a left onto baum or morewood, and if you want to make a right, remember your defensive driving skills because few people who frequent this gego know how to drive. that being said, i do stop by from time to time to grab a redbox, and i still get gas here often (because i like the fuel perks)."
3-star,0,"ooh i miss my ""sheetz run"", but this works when i'm hungry and in a rush. (& its only a 5 minute walk away) although i've only eaten here twice, the cheesesteak was okay for being made to order at a gas station. there is also wi-fi and a nice eating area inside.. not to mention the redbox outside. they usually offer good deals on drinks (i often see a 2/$2 sign on multiple drinks)"
1-star,0,"this place is awful. i've gotten the made to order food twice and i will never order it again. the kitchen always appears dirty, food and receipts everywhere. poor hand-washing, glove using practices. i've seen employees laying their heads on the counters next to the steam tables. coffee area is always a mess. often out of lids, even when it's past rush hour. there's been multiple times that the vanilla creamer is mia for days, but seven open irish creamers will occupy the cold well. employees never remind you to use your advantage card. they are often apathetic and distracted. one time i bought a coffee and paid with a $10. the kid gave me $23 back in change (i didn't notice till after i left) i've been overcharged with refusal to present me with a receipt or fix the problem. as a former getgo manager i am aware of lots of problems within the company, but the job isn't that bad. it pays well over what you would expect (or at least, used to) and comes with benefits and vacation days, even for part-time. i feel like every time i come here i face the worst customer service of anywhere i've ever been. it is no longer a convenience store when the employees making shopping there an inconvenience."
1-star,0,"i'm sure being a get go employee is not what one aspires to be in their youth, but it can't be that bad. since i frequent this location often, ( twice a day on average) i'm aware of the late night rush for fast sandwiches and snacks. and since i work night shifts, i see what a disaster it can be. but the employees....where do i even start? i've always written off their rudeness and complete lack of common courtesy as just them hating their jobs, but recently i've been so utterly appalled by their behavior i just have to say something because its just not right. two weeks ago my car key snapped off in my trunk. i had my spare, but the remote entry battery was dead. of course, my cel phone was locked in my car. i went inside to try to call aaa. "" do you have a phone a could use?"" i asked the man. silence. "" excuse me could i use your phone? i asked 3 times before i was even acknowledged and after about 4 minutes of back and fourth between employees it was decided i was allowed to use it. the cashier tossed the receiver i guess in my direction and, without ever even looking at me "" what's the number"" ? the receiver to my ear, i could hear he was just pounding away, typing in random numbers. he did this about four more times and then claimed it wasn't working because i didn't know the number. i handed him the triple a card so he could read it off that, but he just looked at it, said "" that's what i just called "" and that was it. ok. thanks for the help. a stranger let me use his cel phone and took 45 seconds. two days later, again exhausted after the night shift, i waited to be checked out by any one of the 4 employees hangin out at the deli area. after minutes of debating over which cashier was going to ring me up, a tall girl w long, straight hair came meandering over with a coffee cup suctioned to her chin. it stayed there the whole time. you know, like what a child does? a few times she adjusted it, making disgusting noises and the whole time touching her mouth, face and hair. she rolled her eyes and pounded away on the screen with her nails that had yellow plastic bows on them when i asked her to scan my advantage card. oh i'm sorry, perhaps it would be easier to ask for it if you didn't have a cup stuck to your face. she also never once said a word to or even looked at me. until i said have a good weekend to which she replied under her breathe "" ummmmhmmmm ok"". nice. but the most disgusting display came the next night. a deaf couple was ordering sandwiches, and the red haired cashier, a short, heavy set deli woman, and the tall man who i inconvenienced by asking him to type 7 numbers into the phone, were making fun of them. "" how am i gonna wait on them when they can't hear nuthin?"" waving her hands in an attempt to imitate sign language and speaking "" like a deaf person"". laughing and poking fun while i waited for a cashier and they patiently waited to order. the deaf couple smiled the whole time, completely aware of what was going on, and trying to be the bigger people. i give them credit because i would have snapped. the short woman pointed to the cashier and literally screamed at the "" you'all need to pay over there"" her voice booming through the store. the red haired cashier,as she was ringing me up, heard it and burst into laughter. when the couple turned around, the woman rolled her eyes and her boyfriend put his arm around her and mouthed "" it's ok, don't worry about it"" in his "" deaf guy voice"" ( not my words). i'm aware that this location is about convenience, but there has to be better people out there. management needs to really step in at this point because its simply out of control. i can handle people being rude to me on a daily basis, but i hate to see others, who can't even hear what they're saying, be treated like that! it was awful and every trip there becomes more uncomfortable. come on, get go. step it up. new employees, a new training program, something! this is not right!"
4-star,1,"i agree with tom; if there was a sheetz across the street, that's where i'd be. getgo is a very close second though. i like that if i only spend $50 in groceries that i am getting 20 cents a gallon off. i come here often because i work close and the wifi cafe area is very convenient. during lunch it is crowded. and the mto food can be slow and hit or miss. but the convenience is so great. i love spending lunch there while i work on my computer in front of the huge windows while people watching."
4-star,1,this get go is close but is always soooo crowded. i shop at giant eagle so of course i use the fuel perks for my trucks diesel addiction. anything helps when its 4.23 a gallon. always a big line inside but it moves fast .they also have a red box outside which is convenient. overall a nice store but still it is no sheetz!
4-star,1,"i'm happy to have this get go near where i live. because we buy our groceries at market district we end up saving a lot on gas here. on our first visit we paid about a dollar a gallon because we accumulated savings without knowing it. what a great deal. it's nice to have an automated fast food ordering system. first you punch-in everything you want into the computer, it prints out a receipt, you pay for it at the registers, and they have it ready. today i tried their 'build-your-own-burger' for $3.99.there's a lot of options to put into your burger. i prefer these to five guys. almost every visit, i pick up a dvd from the redbox. such a convenient little store! one major downside is that you can't get cashback on your debit card."
5-star,1,"awesome newly renovated local gas station, convenience store with made to order sandwiches, wraps, breakfast sandwiches. tasty coffee selection, donuts, fountain drinks, and slushies. hot dogs with toppings bar including chili and nacho cheese. free wifi in the sitting area. you can also pick up your redbox dvd rentals here. part of giant eagle so use your advantage card for discounts and fuel savings. also frequent beverage card only takes like 5 purchases to earn a free one... oh yeah, they sell gas... no car wash after the renovation though. oh how i wish we had these in seattle..."
1-star,0,"i can understand why this business only gets two stars, don't go there!!!!!!! it cost me $154 for an oil change and two air filters. even though a manager made me a 7am appt, their staff does not start work until 8am. i felt they were ready to take advantage of me when all i needed was an oil change and air filters. it took almost two and a half hours for the service. i hope they enjoy my $154 because it will be the last money they will get from me. walmart has much bettrr prices and has never taken more than an hour. the cabin air filter cost about $13 and $25 to install. buyer beware."
5-star,1,"i had a really great experience here. my car was having some trouble with a wheel bearing and the manager, ty, was super helpful with hooking me up with a good deal. i had to get back to la so he tried to figure out the fastest way to get the problem fixed and made sure i won't experience this reoccurring problem. they were really busy all day but he still managed to fit me in so i could get home. i highly recommend them."
1-star,0,same report as others. grumpy desk manager and they tried to sell me unnecessary services. the store manager needs some customer service lessons. go to big o tire down the road near grand!!!
1-star,0,"i ordered 2 tires on monday, october 15th and was told that they would be coming from victorville, ca (approximately 350 miles) and would be in around thursday, october 18th. come thursday, i don't hear anything - i call them on friday morning at 9:00 am and the individual at the front desk tells me he'll check on the order and will call me right back. i finally get tired of waiting and call back at around 11:30 am, only to be told that the order never got shipped and i was looking at wednesday, oct 24th. i needed the tires for a car show which i wasn't able to attend. also, during this entire process, pat didn't call me back one time - i had to keep calling. i can see once but this business acts like it doesn't want business. if i had any other way of getting these tires, i would not use this business. i will edit this review once the tires come in and they mount/balance them - i have a bad feeling about having to deal with these people... *edit* the tires came in yesterday, october 24th at around 2:45 pm. i asked what time they closed because i needed the tires mounted/balanced asap. although they closed at 7 pm, they would not get to them until the next day. i told them that this was unacceptable and that i needed the tires mounted and balanced that day - since they were already a week late due to their order screw-up. so i ended up taking the tires/wheels to discount tire on bell road and had them mount/balance in under 1 hour. then i was able to spend the rest of the evening prepping/dipping the wheels. moral of the story: i will never go to goodyear auto service center again. everything; from their failure to followup on my order or follow through and contact customers; to not making concessions to mount/balance my tires that day (i would try and make things as right as possible if i were a business); to me listening to the guy at the counter try and con an old lady into getting a 3-pack of alignments for $75.00 - it all adds up to me rating them at about 1.2 stars - i'll round down."
2-star,0,expect to wait for hours. they are very thorough which is awesome but you will spend all day there for just an oil change. free wifi though. the guy at the counter also wasn't very friendly.
2-star,0,"i used to love this place, the guy who ran it was cool, honest and helpful. after today's initial experience with this new counter guy, i was hesitant to leave my car, but will likely not be back.... the service ended up being okay, but like i said, whatever it was about the new front desk guy, i felt like i was being talked down to and like i was on the verge of being shammed. the place used to be open on sunday's, due to staffing at the moment they are not, so don't even try to book an appointment on line for sunday, they will redirect you. i think i am going to find a new place to do oil changes and car tune ups...sad, i used to love going here."
1-star,0,"took my car in to get a quote on the brakes, my car is a 2011 with only 41,300 miles on it. they wanted to replace all the pads and all the rotors, saying that the rotors were rusted and quoted me $660 for all four. took the car to the dealership who said only the rear brake pads needed to be replaced, i have at least a year left on the front pads. they also said they could easily machine the rotors to remove the rust. typical auto repair shop trying to steal money especially from young women. do not go to this shop."
1-star,0,do not take your car here unless you want something messed up!!! took my car in for an oil change and was told my brake fluids would need changing for an extra 75 bucks. saw the oil light on my car go off in a few weeks but took off getting it looked at for another few weeks. found a nice surpise later that the cap wasnt screwed on right from the last oil change and car had engine damage. these guys are the worst shop in charlotte.
3-star,0,"i've used this goodyear several times over the years because the location is very convenient if you work uptown, just park and walk. i've only used them for oil changes, tire rotations and inspections, nothing major and for those services i have no complaints. they always do a good job and give me the service that i request by the time i request it.....can't ask for much more than that."
1-star,0,"we took our car in for its yearly inspection. to our surprise, the car 'failed'. they quoted us $200 in repair work for a light - which seemed to be working just fine. we took the car down the street for a second opinion where the car passed with no issues. there's something suspicious about this place. i'm just sayin'..."
3-star,0,"i am surprised that this location has a 1 star rating. the few reviews it has seem to be outdated by a few years, so they must have improved since 2007 because i've never had a problem. i have taken my car here several times, mostly because it's convenient to both home and work. walking distance is important if you car doesn't work. i have always been charged the price i was quoted, given the service i expected with no extras thrown in unexpectedly, and i don't think i've ever waited more than 2 hours for my car, even when their parking lot is full. i'm no car expert but i generally get my dad's advice on any repairs i get, and he agrees with me on both service and cost. this is the place he keeps telling me to come back to, anyway. are they the best auto shop i've ever been to? no. but i'd say fair, average service isn't half bad, especially with it's convenient location. it certainly deserves more than 1 star."
1-star,0,"not again a few simple items turned into a large bill. i thought the charges were excessive and questionable services that they stated i needed. i unfortunatey did not have time for my routine mechanic, thought this would be convienent with work location. shopper beware not again for me."
1-star,0,"after visiting this location once, i will not be back. i drive a diesel so i was told that my oil change would be a bit more expensive, which i already knew. but when it took them over 2 hours to change my oil and the final price was $93, i was shocked. the location is great for me since i live uptown, but the service and the price were both totally unreasonable."
1-star,0,i asked for a mount and balance from them and had a good laugh. i buy my tires from the tire rack(online) and goodyear quoted me $154 dollars just to put the tires on! i'd highly recommend kirby & kale in the elizabeth area. they did the same service for $40.
5-star,1,changed my oil and serpentine belts in a hurry! did a great job. been looking for new place since advanced went bad and is now pep boys. very confident i have the right guys! tanner was the best!
1-star,0,"lots of negative reviews. i guess i will add to it. first i got the old ""bait and switch"" told one price then you show up and its double. then they try the old ""the price quoted was by a new employee"". ya, uh-huh! then you hear the mechanic in the back saying f****-it, looks good enough! how many more negative reviews must you see before you look else where? you've been warned."
1-star,0,this andrew guy was very rude when i asked them i needed air check. he actually sent me the discount tire because he was too busy to check my car. i haven't been around a tire shop that sends you to a different tire shop especially a competitive wine due to their laziness to provide customer service and more work. i love how he opened my door after i told him what my psi should be at to be rude and have the courage to open someone's door is just not okay. i honestly hope he's not mentally ill because if so i definitely feel bad about leaving this post.
4-star,1,"i had never been here before but thought i would check it out as i had a coupon for an oil change. i called to see if i could get in that day and was told to stop over in an hour. (no appointment ). when i got there they were swamped and since i couldn't leave my car for a couple of hours, i opted to come back a couple of hours later. i had the oil changed, everything else checked and tires rotated. happy with the service and will go back again."
5-star,1,"came in for an alignment and needed more work done. sadly, i am on a budget but the guys here helped and were very honest! i have never felt like i've been in better hands at an automotive place. they were very friendly and willing to work with me within my means. customer satisfaction truly thankful to have such an automotive place that doesn't take advantage!"
1-star,0,"i came in for an oil change after work in my uniform and they were too busy to take me which is fine, i understand that, so i made an appointment 2 days in advance for an oil change. kenny took down my name, number, and make and model of my car and said i was all set for my appointment for saturday at 10. i came in on time in civilian clothes and they told me i had no appointment and that it would be a 2 hour wait for an oil change, they didn't remember me coming in and making an appointment. then they proceeded to ask me about my job in the military and how long i've been in. i didn't show them any id, so if they really didn't remember me coming in and making an appointment, how would they have known i was in the military? at least get your stories together if you're going to lie to me."
1-star,0,"stay away from this company. don't get me wrong, the people are nice but they are unethical and will try and tell you parts need to be replaced that are still good. the only thing this site would be good for is for oil changes. everything else they will charge you and arm and leg. if you you do have issues the manager won't listen but talk over you and support the over necessary charging of the customers. the manager basically told me that my uncle, who has been a mechanic for over 30 years, doesn't know what he is doing. my uncle fixed the problem for $40 in parts versus the $400 they quoted me."
5-star,1,very pleased with the courteous and professional service i received from ken and kenny. check engine light issue addressed and problem repaired for much less than i expected. they seem to have an honest approach which is really a relief as we're new to surprise and needed to find a trustworthy repair shop. they did not try to find or make up extra issues to be fixed. i hope they are the real deal. time will tell!
5-star,1,ken and kenny are very knowledgeable and will give it to you straight. you won't get the feeling that they are trying to get you to do unneeded work just to maximize the sale. they will honestly tell you what should be done now and what can wait. great feeling to have from a place so close to home. highly recommended.
1-star,0,"we had a coupon and went to this new location for an oil change. my husband also mentioned that we might need need front brakes so had them check as part of their inspection. they called a few hours later with upsetting news, saying the pads and the rotors needed to be replaced because we let the front pads get too low and it damaged the rotors. my husband said we would need to wait since we didn't have the $700 available at that time. when we got the car home he pulled the wheels to inspect the damage. there was not one groove in the rotors and the pads had at least 2,000 miles left on them. not a good first impression at all. now we found that they didn't replace the screw on my oil filter cover either, so it's been flopping around for a few weeks causing a weird noise i couldn't pinpoint. we told them not to rotate the tires as i just had that done, but they did that too. i do not recommend them at all as either they have mechanics who don't know what they are doing, or this was something they just do, on purpose to jack up the repair bill. update-here is the oil filter cover, it's being held on with one rivet!! really guys?!?!?!"
1-star,0,"my first and last time renting from hertz. they are the most expensive car rental company. i decided to treat myself to a luxury suv. i always assumed hertz has great customer service. when i arrive their rental counter is 3 people deep, line wrapped around zig zag poles, and the self check ins filled. it was complete bedlom. so i got on my smart phone and rented an suv from their next door competitor. what a joke this company is."
2-star,0,"the driest, slowest customer service in a company. they ""need to get the car ready"" whatever the heck that means since i've rented at this location (not company) and you just go to the garage and get your car. they don't even have the car you rent online. it gets the job done and compared to other companies i guess it's not as bad but far far away from being the best or even descent. don't expect them to be helpful either. as a matter of fact, their slogan should be ""so bad it hertz""."
1-star,0,"unless you have a few hours to waste, please don't rent from the hertz las vegas location. despite having a reservation, we waited for over an hour, at which point we were directed to a self-serve kiosk where we spoke to a rep located elsewhere. this rep couldn't even be bothered to guide us through the next steps to pick up our vehicle after the initial check in process. thus, we found ourselves wandering around the garage on our own trying to find a rep who would direct us to our vehicle. we finally encountered a hertz employee who directed us to a specific vehicle and very clearly told us that we could take it. however, when we arrived at the exit gate, the employee stationed there proceeded to interrogate us regarding why we took this vehicle and who told us we could take it, specifically demanding that we provide the name of the employee (who we talked to for two seconds, during which she never identified herself). when i attempted to explain that we went through the proper procedure for checking in and obtaining the vehicle this individual characterized my explanation as ""rude."" by the time this rep ""allowed"" us to leave the garage with the vehicle for which we already paid, the entire check in process had taken an hour and a half. i think i'll use another company from now on."
1-star,0,"terrible customer service at this center. pressured to buy all kinds of stuff, and the clerk gave me a bad look when i said no thanks."
1-star,0,"the customer representative i got tonight didn't want to rent tonight. very rude. they do not rent to locals with a debit card. of course when you call them, they say you need two forms of id but they don't tell you that at the counter. i will never rent from them. i cancelled my other rental reservations with them also."
4-star,1,"great experience! i am a gold member, so i received an email about the car i was getting and the stall number. no wait time in line. however the car stated in the email was not in that stall. i went to the gold member service counter where they corrected the mix up immediately. i was in and out within 10 mins. clean car, quick service, no unnecessary surprise charges. they are my go-to for rental car services."
1-star,0,"absolutely no people in line, yet the employees behind the counter refused to help us and instead referred us to the hertz live agent machine. i looked up the point of the live agent machine, and i understand that they are supposed to be hertz's solution for long lines, but referring us to use the machine when there was absolutely no line is poor customer service. if customer service is really important to hertz, they said make the policies clear to their agents."
1-star,0,"be aware this cheating company !! horrible. the worst hertz i ever experienced. after waiting for 40 minutes to get myself speak to an agent, the nightmare began. first, the lost damage waiver insurance alone cost something like $26.99 per day, and they claimed that other car rentals who provided cheaper options were lying by packaging personal liability insurance as ldw. since i'm not professional insurer, i can't tell - can anyone please justify whether what she said was true? second, when i walked to the garage to get my car, there was a wrong car parked in the number they assigned to me. thanks god there was an agent in the garage, and she assigned another car for me - until i saw the car i realized that she tried to cheat me with a cheaper/ lower grade car. i had to went back again, asked for my third car, while i overheard the guy in front of me was arguing the same thing. third try it wasn't the same grade of car i paid for but rather again a cheaper car. finally i gave up because it was late and i decided to leave this awful place. last month i rented a car from avis and it went all well. the agent there even told me that they have better deal on that day so they could lower my price. i got a great car and was very happy about it. conclusion: i will never go back to hertz again."
1-star,0,"this has to be the worst hertz location ever. my husband likes hertz but we have never once arrived in las vegas - and we have family here, so we're here often - without having something very wrong with the car. usually we return the car the next day because something is mechanically wrong. often it's the totally wrong car (we only have full sized or we only have economy, even though we'd reserved another size). last time the car was so filthy (inside) that we had to wash it upon leaving - we couldn't deal with the stickiness and were too far to bring it back when we noticed. i said this is the last time - if something goes wrong, that's it. this time it was actually the car we ordered - hooray! but then the stench, and i mean stench of cigarette smoke was unbearable. when you complain they just say okay, return the car, with no reparation for the hassle. i never write negative reviews as a rule but i have complained and nothing has changed. it's just the worst."
1-star,0,hands down worst car rental experience i've ever had. normally i go with avis and it's obvious once again i should have done so. i booked my car specifically a toyota prius through the aaa allied group online for 205 upon arrival i have to speak to a lady through a kiosk not in person but might as well have face timed me. she tells me we're getting a ford fusion and that's not what i requested/booked online. i ask for a prius (the one picture in my email was a prius liftback. she says there's one prius but it has navigation so automatically adding 36 bucks when that's not how it booked online. keep in mind it was 165 before tax and fees bringing it to 205. she asks if i want to charge has already. the 21 bucks for that was fine. and then the total comes to 274 and some change leaving 17 bucks in charges i have no idea. i ask her to specify she says ma'am what your screen reads in front of you is what i have. i say fine. this is the last time i'm booking with you. okay ma'am the card will also stay authorized for another 476 until you turn the vehicle in. you have got to be kidding me????? so 276 plus 476 hold on my card. glad that wasn't all i brought to vegas. the service was absolutely horrible and i will never be booking with them again. it addition to that they don't even give me a prius or intermediate car as she describes she gave me a prius c which thankfully i love but that's more compact. so it shouldn't be charged as such.
1-star,0,"renting with hertz hurts. i get that systems go down sometimes, but when you've been waiting for over an hour and no alternatives have been give its just not good. would have been nice for them to have a system in place to process rentals for cars that were reserved and paid for ahead of time."
1-star,0,"horrible experience. we trip to vegas frequently but this is our first time using hertz. when we got there, they gave us a total which was 3 times the amount we booked it for online so she had to fix it. good thing we had the confirmation and noticed. then when we got to the car, we loaded up the trunk with our 3 bags and the trunk space was great. then we got in the car and it smelled heavy of marijuana. the attendant told us to go back to the desk and get a new car, so we did. then when we got to the car, it had a trunk that only had enough room for 2 bags so we went back and asked for another car. he gave us another car and this one was even smaller. it would barely fit the 4 of us let alone our luggage! when we booked it, the website said the car seated 5. he said they didn't have anything else. so we gave up and just asked for the first car they gave us and we would drive with the windows down and bear with the smell until we could buy some fabric refresher. then when we returned it, he inspected the car and told us we scratched and dented it. we told him those were already there but they didn't seem to have the initial inspection, convenient, so they made us fill out an incident report to let them know the damage was already there so they didn't charge us for it. finally, he asked us if we filled up the gas tank and we said yes. he said they needed the receipt otherwise they would charge us for gas. well nobody told me at the beginning that i needed the receipt so i didn't get one as i paid cash. he said he would waive it this time, as if he was doing us a favor. we will never be renting from them again."
1-star,0,"apparently this location is known for their illegitimate fuel charge! i'm a gold member and i always fill up the gas. i always stay for the receipt also at return so i can confirm the charges. however, last night at las, there was only one person working the return and about 6 cars waiting. we had to go catch our flight and so the guy told us to go ahead, and now i have an email charging me for fuel when we filled up beforehand. renter be aware! get to the airport early for return and stay for the check out to make sure they don't charge you extra for fuel!!!"
4-star,1,good clean car with a decent military discount. the only downside was talking to a representative on a video screen during the rental process. the representatives accent was difficult to understand. i almost said yes to higher rental rate for another vehicle until i figured out what he was asking. having a real person to talk to and not a video person makes a big difference. the remainder of the process was smooth and easy.
4-star,1,"hertz is #1 in car rentals for a reason. impeccable customer service, they aim to get you in and out as quickly as possible. i've used many rental car companies & hertz really stands out. the cars i've received have always been what i reserved or better, brand new & in great condition. they also take debit cards & rent to people under 25 (providing you purchase their $25/day full coverage insurance) only thing holding them back from 5-stars is their insistence on you brining back the receipt for gas if you went under 75 miles. seems very penny-pincher to me & even though i'm sure it saves hertz gas & makes them money, it seems petty."
5-star,1,this is is response to peter m . who was upset that he could not get a free upgrade on his priceline rental and had his friend take a picture of me and try to intimidate me in to giving you something for free... i knew you would go on yelp...people like you always do....i am so happy that i have been trained to spot opportunists and not to give in...it is a shame you like to disparage people for your own sick reasons...i hope you enjoy your kia....management has already pulled the tapes of you flashing your travel agent card and your friend taking a picture of me as i rented the car....they also know you are a liar as my 2 co-workers heard the conversation.....next time show a little class and just pay for an upgrade......intimidation is ugly...
1-star,0,"i signed up for hertz gold to avoid the long wait at the rental counter. i reserved a ford focus (or 'similar'), a focus is a compact car (i never rent subcompacts). i was given a yaris. i went back to hertz gold desk and requested a compact, i was told that hertz considers focus and yaris equivalent. so they subsituted a versa 109 horsepower (vs the yaris 106) . they absolutely refused to upgrade me to a compact. so at that point i asked for the free upgrade (based on the prominent signs 'free upgrade for hertz gold') but apparently that is only valid if you reserve a mid-size car to start with. at this point i was very annoyed, took the versa to avoid wasting one more second of my vacation on the hertz bait and switch tactics. so they have lost a customer. the two week international car rental we have planned in june will not be with hertz. news flash to hertz. a compact is a different class than a subcompact. a ford focus is a compact, similar cars would include corolla, civic, jetta, mazda3, dart, impreza. a subcompact includes the chevrolet sonic, ford fiesta, honda fit, hyundai accent, kia rio, mazda 2, nissan versa, scion xd, suzuki swift, and toyota yaris. these two are 'similar'? hardly. yaris msrp: from $14,895 curb weight 2,315 to 2,335 lbs horsepower 106 engine: 1.5 l 4-cylinder dimensions: 156? l x 67? w x 59? h focus msrp: from $17,225 curb weight: 2,935 to 3,055 lbs horsepower: 123 to 350 hp engine: 2.0l 4-cyl. dimensions: 172-179? l x 72? w x 58? h note: avis offers economy and compact categories. they clearly know the difference."
4-star,1,"decent rental service. typical airport rental feel - a bit rushed but convenient. the parking garage system they have there is pretty fluid and easy. received a great rate from usaa, so saved a bit of money. don't recommend taking the managers special unless you don't mind a mitsubishi mirage or smaller vehicle."
1-star,0,"worst hertz i've ever experienced. and will be the worst forever since i'm moving away from hertz because of this time. firstly i was expecting a standard sized car for 35.6 per day for 4 days to drive round trip to grand canyon national park. the guy welcomed us and advised us with 1. ""huge discount"" to upgrade to suv, 2. fuel purchase option. for the first one, i asked ""how much i need to pay for that suv?"" he said 25, so i guess it's 25 total. i never thought that could be 25 more per day. because if plused 25, the price has no difference as listed on there website, so please tell me where is the freaking ""huge discount""? by the way, why i'm choosing the suv instead of my original choice is because that guy's suggestion of safety concern. but believe me there's not at all need for an suv. for the second one, fuel purchase option, the guy said it will go with the medium price which is 2.59 something i remember, but when i drived out, the gas stations around are all about 2.29, even 76 and chevron are no more than 2.4/gallon so please tell me how comes 2.59 can be the medium price? what was worse, after slided my card, i asked if i bring my car back half-full, the remaining gas will be refuded or not. i believe they will because i rented with avis as well and they do return, so i was asking just to make sure. but it turned out he said no...how comes you didn't tell me before i slided my card? i am a hertz gold member and hertz was always my first choice, but this time i feels i was betrayed. for those guys who still rent with hertz, my suggestion is, do not buy any upgrade options and do not slide your card before understand everything!"
1-star,0,"i'm giving a one star review because of the sneaky person on the video kiosk (not sure what it's actually called). we rented a car for the week through priceline. the person on the screen confirmed our rental, a full size car, which had already been paid for. it was a chevy impala. my husband brought an expired credit card (whoops) so we had to use our debit card for the deposit. they normally hold $200 for that. long story short, at the end of the week my husband noticed they'd taken about $400 out of our account. he looked more closely at the contract and it said that we'd been upgraded to a chevy impala...we'd paid for that kind! it didn't seem to make sense so my husband went down to speak with someone about it. the original rep upgraded the car to one with more options without even asking! it took several hours of the day (away from our vacation) to straighten things out. the only way to fix it was for my husband to return the car, which meant he had to leave and fill the gas tank up, then come back. he had to unload our stuff from it into a different car (which was actually better, just didn't have leather seats and a sun roof)! there were a few more issues, but not significant to this. anyway, the person he spoke with this day, chuck, was super! he fixed everything and was able to refund us, but i do not like that sneaky behavior of the original rep! be very very careful when you rent a car from hertz! i'm guessing this may be quite common! original guy gets zero stars! chuck gets 5 stars."
5-star,1,"lots of negative reviews. for me? about as good as it gets. i'm a gold member so i flew in, my name was on the board, and my paid for vehicle was ready to go, no fuss. it was about as easy as it gets. the return was simple too. the car was looked over and a final total and receipt was printed and given to me. no complaints at all about the car or service..."
1-star,0,"worst rental car company ever. 5 years or so ago las hertz was a relatively good car rental co. it's been downhill since then. in general, sadly, this has been been true for the centers i've visited in other cities such that i doubt i'll use them again unless there's just no other choice. the desks are understaffed and frankly the ""tele-service"" kiosk scheme just doesn't give you any personal touch whatsoever - nor did the one i tried to use work. the absolute worst thing about hertz, however, is the abysmal condition of the fleet and the limited number of cars available. they have either not had the car that i reserved, or the one car of that type that they do have is dented, has over 45,000 miles on it and smells like cigarette smoke. customer service is unfriendly and unapologetic. today i was told i could wait around and see what comes in. sorry, but the last thing i want to do is spend my business trip or vacation waiting at a hertz rental center."
1-star,0,"if i could give them no stars i would. this location is the worse!! i had three bad vehicles through these people. one needed an oil change, the other overheated, one had 'maintenance required.' on our third rental, the car overheated and we ended up stranded for two hours on the highway. the emergency roadside never showed nor called us back to confirm our safety. the manager could care less and offered us money off our next return, as if i would be crazy enough to rent from them again. they also attempted to charge me a late rental fee when the car was returned, although we had to exchange the car again once we got to our destination. i also prepaid. this was the worse experience ever, and ruined our vacation since we had to keep going back and forth with these terrible vehicles. save yourself the trouble and do not rent from here. my first and last time renting through hertz. i will never use this company again."
1-star,0,"renting cars from hertz for the past 10 yrs. never once i was given a lesser of a car than i asked for. never ask for the managers special. it meant whatever car that they can rent out and it's not cheaper either. when they say surprising you, the meant it. i'm surprised by how bad they treat their customer. you will be driving around vegas in a beat up sub compact or minivan."
1-star,0,"this rental car location is horrible! our first time renting a car was decent, yet the rude workers still remain the same. lifeless and disgusting. the second time we came here hertz gave us an economy car even though we reserved a compact car! they wouldn't even give a refund because it was ""not their fault. ."" we felt bad for the 20 people waiting in line for their rental because their lot was out of cars even if they made a reservation. what's the point of a reservation when you aren't going to have a car? oh and the manager is a big fat asshole. we had problems with our rental reservation at the same time and all he told us was ""that's your problem, not mines. stop wasting my time."" on top of that, we waited 45 mins just to hear him say that. the cars are disgusting as well. the passenger side of our car where you adjust your seat had a bunch of sticky gunk all over . a diaper underneath the seat. a bad fishy scent that came from the a.c every time you turned it on. and the car was just plain dirty inside and out. we were also charged for a full tank gas even if we full tanked the gas before arriving back. never ever coming back here again!!!!! they need to train their workers with customer service classes or better yet fire all the workers + manager and hire new ones. such a bad bad bad bad name for the company."
1-star,0,"hertz has bombed twice now. first no cars for hundreds of people in denver. now we paid for an intermediate, took 40 minutes to get a car and when i checked nissan versa is a compact. contract clearly states intermediate and versa is a compact. would not answer phone. do not want to waste vacation with this kind of company. what happened to hertz?!?! no stars."
1-star,0,miserable and slow. just like the last 3 times. the worst part of any vegas visit i toyed with giving a bad review before. but figures it was just a one time bad experience. no. this is multi year trend.
1-star,0,"avoid renting from this location if at all possible. i had a prepaid reservation and when i arrived there were about 200 people in line and there was a 4 hour wait for a car. clearly hertz prefers to collect money on late returns and offers no assistance or credit whatsoever to those who have a paid reservation. luckily i was able to get a refund on my reservation and took a cab to my hotel. hertz had no answer when i asked for cab fare or assistance in booking with another company. they simply told us to go wait in the other lines or make calls on our own. this seems to be common with hertz. lines are always long and nothing seems to be easy. i had a similar issue in san diego. i never have this issue with alamo or enterprise. unfortunately when using hot-wire, you take a risk. keep that in mind - especially if you see a ""too good to be true"" rate."
1-star,0,"my husband left his cell phone in a rental car returned to hertz on dec 30th. we filed on the phone system that the phone was lost... 1/4 i received a notice jan 4th that my cell phone had been found. matched item number: item000111391. so excited! 1/4 clicked the ""mail me the item"" button and paid for postage to ship the cell. so excited! 1/8 received an email that my phone had been found matched item number 110147 1/10 called to see if the item would be mailed soon. concerned, just checking 1/13 called again to see if the item would be mailed soon, told that they just need to issue a shipping label and it would be mailed. annoyed 1/14 called again to see if the item would be mailed soon, told that they just need to issue a shipping label and it would be mailed. annoyed 1/15 called to see if the item would be mailed soon, told that they just need to issue a shipping label and it would be mailed. more annoyed 1/15 issued a shipping label 1/15 checked tracking number 1z96y1751298140961, not mailed as of yet. hopeful 1/16 checked tracking number 1z96y1751298140961, not mailed as of yet. sad 1/16 checked tracking number 1z96y1751298140961, not mailed as of yet. frustrated!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 1/17 checked tracking number 1z96y1751298140961, not mailed as of yet. called customer service at hertz. given this email address. days later received a call from customer care and they told me that hertz never did have the phone (odd considering the number of emails i received stating that they did have my phone). i am sure someone just dropped the ball and was sick of dealing with me. it is much easier to say, oh sorry, we never had your phone, that to admit they lost my phone. if the company was just going to essentially steal my cell phone, it would have been best to not inform me that it had been found. now i am out a iphone and beyond annoyed. and hertz is out a customer."
4-star,1,"decent service, organized and orderly car rental area (all the car rental agencies operate through a large hub south of the airport so you go to the same place for all of them) and the opportunity to rent a vette for my stay in vegas make this a great place to rent from. i love that hertz has performance cars available as part of its fun collection - you can't do much better for a rental car while in vegas (without paying an arm and a leg for exotic car rental) than the corvette zhz. now, i'm not a vette guy, and the car is technically outstanding - think 450 horsepower 2 seater sports car with lots of creature comforts and traction and handling controls - but it's everything you want for tooling around town or stylin' on the strip. nice sound system, gps, individual climate control, push button start, etc. it is a hell of a lot of fun . . . so if you want to do vegas right . . . get thee in a 'vette!"
5-star,1,"excellent service. staff is very friendly, efficient, knowledgeable and affordable. from hybrid batteries to headlights this is the place to go!"
5-star,1,"very professional, understanding, honest and friendly people. if you have a problem with your hybrid car definitely this is the first place to go."
5-star,1,"great costumer service! so nice that the lady in the office has knowledge of hybrid cars. very helpful, they answered all my questions. i'll definitely recommend and come back for their services."
5-star,1,we had a great experience with hybrid auto center. they were very quick and honest. we needed the engine fixed on our 2007 toyota camry hybrid. will definitely use them again if we need to!
1-star,0,called this repair center to see about a code that my 2008 ford escape hybrid had from a check engine light. this hybrid repair center said they wouldn't help me and they didn't need anymore work so they wouldn't take my ford hybrid. perhaps they should take the ford logo off their webpage...
5-star,1,"these reviews are spot on! hybrid auto is quick, efficient, courteous, thorough explanations, patient when you have questions, this is customer service at its finest!! they will go out of their way to help you. they came in on their day off when shop is normally closed so i could get my car. they changed my battery in my key remote just because, and best of all got my prius to run again after hv battery died. i paid $300 for replacing worn out cell instead of spending 2-3000 $ for new battery. i didnt hve that kind of $, now i hve time to save for when battery has to b replaced!! i cant say enough, please check them out when you have battery issues. they may b able get you on the road again without hving brand new battery. either way will definitely save you $!!!;-)"
5-star,1,"i can't say enough good about this company. i went to another shop (sun auto repair) and got a estimate of $750 labor and diagnosing problem, not including part. (i came really close to getting ripped off) long story short, i called hybrid auto told him i needed a abs pump put in my 2006 toyota hybrid and he said no problem $250 labor and he would have diagnosed the problem no charge and did it the next day. (price didn't include part) got my car back and i wish i would have went to him 1st. this guy seems to be 100% honest. i think he is one of those people who actually understands you can make money being honest."
5-star,1,took a prius to get checked out as the battery gave. the owner and his wife run a super honest business and are very friendly...a refreshing find in this industry. he tested the expensive prius battery and found only one bad cell that needed replacement as opposed to thinking i was looking at a major repair. returning the next day and with just over a couple hundred $ out of the piggy bank (as opposed to a couple thousand) she was back on the road. i wouldn't think twice about returning here for an honest and free assessment of any hybrid related car issues should a future problem arise.
5-star,1,"this guy is great, he knows what his doing, very knowledgeable. if something is under warranty he will refer you to the dealer rather than taking your money like many other shops"
5-star,1,great and fast service he checked my car give me a honest answer and the prices are very very good i would recommend anybody with a hybrid vehicle to go here he definitely knows what he's doing now my car is approved on mileage so i'm happy thank you
5-star,1,"i got my prius fixed here today, i was quite impressed with nick's (owner) work and business ethic. nick knows his stuff, he was honest with me and gave me answers to all my question. took him about 5 minutes to hook up his computer to my car and was able to diagnose the problem right away. two of my prius battery cells were going bad, so he replaced that within a day and even stayed a bit late so i can pick up my car. best of all, he gave me a very fair price. don't go to the dealership, you will end up spending more. car is running strong with no problem. if you are looking for a shop to service your prius, look no further than the hybrid auto center, you won't regret it."
5-star,1,this place rocks! honest. intelligent. competent. fair. fast. i am beyond impressed with the expertise and ethic of this business. thank you!!!
5-star,1,"he's seriously the best in vegas!! gone here several times never any bs and always honest and quick and he seriously knows his stuff no joke, don't take your car anywhere else!!!"
5-star,1,"oh no! i got the red triangle of death on my 2004 (150k miles) prius! a local hybrid mechanic charged me $105 to ""diagnose"" the problem: hybrid battery failure (no further details), and offered to replace the battery for $2900. happily i found hybrid auto center! nick hooked the prius up to his computer and showed me the voltage and resistance measurements for each individual cell (there are 28 cells). hybrid auto center offers several options from individual cell replacement to practically new, reconditioned total replacement, each a little more $ than the last, each with a longer warranty. the new $2900 battery offered by garage ""a"" came with a 1 year warranty, hybrid auto centers highest price option comes with a longer warranty for a fraction of the cost. excellent customer service, fast turn around. though i hope to never need their services again, i would definitely go back and will highly recommend them to other hybrid and electric vehicle drivers."
1-star,0,"total flake. it's unfortunate because he does a good job. if you value your time don't waste it on him. he definitely doesn't value your time. garrett was supposed to start doing my car every other week. showed up first time. second time, he was a no show. no call or text. says he got stuck doing more cars then planned. he offered me that excuse after i contacted him five hours after he was supposed to show up. bottom line is i gave him another chance cause he offered me a free cleaning. took only till next time when he didn't show up again. i never contacted him. then he had nerve to call me following week and agree that he missed appt again but was in my neighborhood and can do my car in a few hours. i told him i already found a more reliable company and i'm done."
5-star,1,"i cannot recommend immaculate enough. garrett's attention to detail is amazing. he really has a passion for what he does and it shows. i'm getting ready to sell one of my vehicles and it had been sitting in my driveway for a year, it was in rough shape. when garrett was done, it literally looked brand new, especially the engine bay. wow! keep up the good work garrett and i wish you the best of luck in your new location. thank you!"
5-star,1,excellent work with particular attention to detail. very meticulous in his process. worth every penny! first time customer who will be a repeat customer.
5-star,1,"these guys detailed my boat and i have to say, after sitting all winter, it was a mess. looks like new again. great job. can't wait to be the shiniest boat on the lake"
5-star,1,"garrett does unbelievably high end and quality job. he has detailed my maserati and made it look as if i just drove it off the showroom floor. he has also detailed some work trucks and other miscellaneous vehicles that we have. he treats them all with the same attention to detail. up next, my 45' motorhome!"
1-star,0,"i really hate to do this because i like garret very much. but for the last month he has completely blown me off. originally this was a 5 star review, and i am keeping those comments below. excellent professional service. garret is a straight shooter in a profession that seems to attract a lot of bs artists. my car was a tough one - black, with lots of baked on water spots. they had to spend a lot of time to get it right and kept the price very fair. got the headlights and ""chrome"" cleaned up too. garret is very concerned that he does quality work and that the customer is happy."
5-star,1,"garrett did a fantastic job cleaning and detailing my vehicle. i have a 2012 subaru wrx sti and wanted to make sure the paint was maintained properly with a good washing and sealant application. ive had several cars in the past ranging from supras, m3, gto, etc, so i'm somewhat of a car nut. i've also had some pretty sub par experiences with ""other"" mobile detailers here in the east valley. they would charge you and arm and a leg ($90-$100) and would only take 1 hour to complete the job using 1 person. now im not an expert at math or anything, but unless they had more than 2 arms, a quality detail sure as heck takes more than 1 hour, i know this from doing them myself. quality work takes time, especially if you want it done right. garrett was easy to work with, we set a time of 6am to start before it starting heating up outside. he showed up on time at 6, introduced himself, and started to work. everything he has is self contained, so its very professional, he has everything he needs to complete the job. we discussed over the phone that it would take 2-3 hours to complete the detail because he had to use the polisher to apply the sealant. i would rather pay someone good money for a complete job, rather than a half assed job because they wanted to get done quickly. he had great attention to detail and even used some cutting compound to remove some surface scratches i had not previously noticed. overall a great experience and great quality work for this price, especially for the time he takes, also dealing with the arizona heat. highly recommended!"
5-star,1,"garrett does a fantastic job and he is super nice! even the basic wash makes your car look brand new. the best part is that he comes to you! it is so convenient, especially when you have a busy work schedule. just call him up and he will come to your office. he really cares about doing a great job and obtaining loyal customers. when i had something wrong with weird hard water spots on my car he was willing to go above and beyond to help get rid of them. i highly recommend anyone and everyone use him!!!"
5-star,1,"found myself in need of towing service after my daughter's car broke down one night. she was able to get her car pushed out of traffic and into the nearest parking area by a gas station. it wasn't in an actual designated parking spot so hubby felt we should get it towed to a shop before someone else decides to have it towed to an impound. i know at an impound we would've had to pay at least $200 to get it out, then pay for towing on top of that, so i was happy with the $85 quote i got from efren at instant towing. he was prompt and courteous and handled our vehicle carefully as if it belonged to his family member. we followed him to the toyota shop where he unloaded our car. he did took care of everything quickly, efficiently, and smoothly, wrote up my invoice and handed me back my keys. i believe this company accepts credit cards, but i picked up cash before meeting up with him anyway and when he wrote up my invoice it was for exactly the amount he quoted me - no extras, no hidden fees, no tricks. this company is legit and the service is outstanding!"
1-star,0,this company came to tow my car and drop it off at the tire shop less than 1 mike away from my location. they asked for $65 over the phone with $5 charge for a card transaction. then the towing person ends up charged me $75 and i expressed my concern. i let it go. then i go and check my bank account and they charged me $80. not to mention that my car is not blue and i had a flat tire not breakdown. do not use them. definitely not trustworthy.
5-star,1,"he came and rescued me at 10:00 pm out in the middle of nowhere. he was there within an hour, was polite and professional. after getting me out of the ditch he followed me to make sure my car was ok. i would definitely use them again if i need help."
5-star,1,"they said they would be here in 20 min, and guess what.....they were here in 20 min. i will lock them in my system, and use them every time i need a tow. my driver was quick and professional."
1-star,0,"the lack of knowledge & care for the guy that drives this truck 24/7, while unloading my car he ripped my bumper off because he left the chain on the bed with the hook facing up.... he then said you don't have to pay me if you don't want too after fucking my bumper up lol what a complete joke this guy is, then i asked for the boss he reports too he then said he's not in. absolute shit service to tow anything please be aware if considering this guy"
5-star,1,"this guy is super nice, we schedule for 3:30 pm and he actually arrived a few minutes before which is very professional from him! the price was very reasonable and he actually help me to push my big heavy truck to my parking space! highly recommend!!! thanks a lot for the service"
5-star,1,super professional people. was stranded on the california side of the nevada border. guy went out and towed my car to a car shop. very reasonable price. highly recommend.
5-star,1,the guy was super nice and helpful and it wasn't a bad price at all and he got to my moms car with in less then 20 mins of calling him we were on the side of the freeway and he came and helped us out i would recommend this to anyone who needs a quick tow for a great rate.
5-star,1,"i was desperate and they were fast and friendly to change my tire... wasn't cheap but less expensive that one other place i called, i was just thankful for their reliability. thanks!"
5-star,1,"great service and a great guy! towed my car to a garage for me on father's day, of all days. really professional and friendly, and really quick too!"
5-star,1,"seriously, this guy was so fast! and so nice. 3 girls and 2 flat tires, needless to say we were a little panicked... but he got there, got the car loaded and to the shop before it closed. great price, great service, highly recommend!!"
1-star,0,"i got an oil change and my mother in law decided to surprise us and accidentally got an oil change the next day. basically only drove 50 km and we got charged for a second oil change. went back expecting a refund and understanding but was instead told ""tracking miles is not our responsibility"" and refused to refund. definitely ripped off and took advantage of a senior citizen. careful you may be up sold or charged for additional service unnecessarily.. best to try another location."
5-star,1,"i called to see what the wait times might be. i also mentioned that i might have a blown fuse and could we take a look at that too. they said sure. so off i went. no line up, instant service, friendly, prompt and we took a look at the issue and found the right fuse (not the same as in the manual) and off i went. very happy. totally worth the drive! thank you very much for your great service and sense of humor!!!"
5-star,1,"tremendous service. fast and honest, never tried to push additional services and even suggested i hold off on changing my front diff. the dealership would've just done these things and handed me the bill. by the way, i drove from se calgary to this location specifically. keep up the great work boys"
5-star,1,"awesome service. i have gone here for every oil change needed since they opened. the service techs are very professional and personable. also needed an emergency battery change on my wife's car, had to jump it just to get it there, no problem, they replaced the battery at a good price."
5-star,1,"awesome. these guys are great! i went to the creekside location, and was very impressed. they don't hassle or lie or try to sell you things you don't need like other places (cough cough mr lube). they even put on some wipers that i had purchased elsewere. friendly, funny, easy to talk to, all over great place with great people. will definetly be going back!"
5-star,1,"i went to jiffy lube on sunridge way.these guys are awesome.the best customer service i ever had. there was 3 guys and they were all helpful,polite and a pleasure to deal with. i will definitely go here for all my future car services! i give them 10 stars if i could!"
4-star,1,"as my car dealership requires an appointment for an oil change to be booked about 3 years in advance, i was looking for somewhere to go quickly before leaving on vacation. i looked on yelp and found lube-x. it was close enough to work and seemed like the other reviewer had a good experience. i was greeted by a really nice guy who chatted with me the whole time i was there (it wasn't busy at the time). although they had some trouble matching my car's oil filter (the one in the book didn't match, although it was for 2011 and my car is 2012), they went the extra mile by calling their boss before just going with the one that fit. the boss seemed to be doing some research from home, as he kept calling back. they showed me my air filter and told me it didn't need to be replaced. also, he never tried to sell me anything i didn't need (which always happened at the minit-lube i went to years ago). i was very happy with my experience and wouldn't hesitate to go back here again."
5-star,1,"these guys were awesome. because the area is new, they are usually pretty quiet which means no waiting in line! they were very friendly, super fast, and gave me a free travel mug and window scraper! i will absolutely go back here, mostly because they are so quick and it's easy to get in and out right away."
1-star,0,"two major issues with what they have done and why i will never go back: 1. i saw that the tire pressure was low after an oil change. i went back. they looked at it and said that i should drive around a bit more, or take it somewhere to check if the dashboard lights are accurate. days later, no change. i went to a gas station to put air in the tires myself, but the light stayed on. i went for my next oil change and had them check again. they said there was no problem. i went back to arizona, and the first person i went to found a nail in the tire that jiffy lube didn't see over three visits. that's incompetence or laziness, neither of which you want when you are dealing with your car. 2. they forgot to put the cover on correctly after my last oil change. i was driving cross-country, and the cover broke off halfway through. it was completely damaged so i had to go replace that as well. i was unfortunately not able to take this receipt back to jiffy lube since i had this work done three months before i returned to champaign. this is also the most expensive place that i have gotten an oil change, even after the coupons that they offer."
5-star,1,"i was just in for the first oil change with jiffy lube on my kia sorento. i voted the tires and changed the wiper blades. no problems. cost is what is expected from a place like this. the men that work there are hard-working. there was a situation that happened before me where an older man claimed there was money taken from his car and this is unfortunate. on the one hand it is totally possible, but more than not i'd think he had forgotten he used it or gave it to someone. i've been there. i made accusations and i was wrong before when i was younger (20s and 30s). the manager gave the man $10 from his own pocket to remedy the situation saying sternly that his men wouldn't do such a thing. i believe him. this could ruin a business and can really make these men's already tough life harder. i've been on both ends of this case. as a worker and here as a client. the older man who i spoke to briefly before and afterward seems like a decent man, but i think he is mistaken. it is always a risk to give your car over to anyone and especially when you can't see what they are doing, but i have no complaints. the manager even gave me a $10 discount. so he lost $20 that day just to please this customers. i will go back again."
1-star,0,have taken my used motor oil here for years to recycle it. they were always friendly and happily took the oil. today they were rude and said it would cost $10 bucks to recycle my oil. ran up the road to walmart where they happily recycled the oil for free. it's important that oil retailers accept used motor oil for recycling. shame on you jiffy lube!
5-star,1,"not too sure why this place has low stars. possibly old reviews bringing the rating down. anyway, i went to jiffy lube this morning and they had great service. super fast, friendly, and honest. they didn't try to sell me any additional services that i didn't need and were overall great. i usually get my oil changes in chicago but being a student here i had to get it done in champaign. i'd definitely return."
4-star,1,good place for an oil change. they're always able to get you in and out with little wait time. they also have online coupons for discounts that are always available. workers are always nice and not pushy about trying to pressure you into extra services. keep up the good work!
1-star,0,"i wanted to try this place out since it's so close to where i work, but i will not be going back. i took my car in for a standard oil change to then be told that they can't change my oil because the last place that did it (a different company in champaign) stripped the screws (or something along those lines) and that i should go back to demand they fix it. i didn't want to take my car back someplace that supposedly messed something up the first time, so i ended up taking my car to my mechanic instead. he then told me that they were wrong and he had no problem changing my oil. i'm not sure what their intentions were..? possibly make the other company look bad if i would go back and claim they messed something up? also, my boyfriend has taken his car here and they claimed he had several lights out. when he brings the car home to fix himself, there's only 1 out of the 4 they claimed to be out. i would ask to see the lights before you allow them to fix it."
5-star,1,so fast!! they go over all the recommendations so its easy to understand. plus they had the stuff that my chevy needed right then and there. they had the doors open so it was nice to be in the lobby. i brought bills to pay while i waited and couldn't even finish. highly recommend.
5-star,1,i come here every time i need a oil change. i never have any problems with them. the staff is very friendly. they get the job done fast and well. there isn't much more i could ask for. i would definitely recommend this jiffy lube over anywhere else.
1-star,0,"very very rude staff! you go in for service and they talk down to you like you don't know a thing about a vehicle. they try to push all kinds of additional services on you and then get even more rude when you decline. my car smelled like someone had smoked in it when i finally was able to leave, very unprofessional place!"
1-star,0,"worse place in town! they smoke in the garage area and when i left my car smelled like an ashtray. when i complained the guy shrugged his shoulders and said sorry. having asthma his ""sorry"" wasn't good enough."
5-star,1,"2/21/2015 i stopped by to get my oil changed on my way home. when i pulled in, i was greeted immediately and shown in to the waiting area; where they had a clean restroom, complimentary coffee, and an array of reading materials. they did a thorough inspection of my car and alerted me to a few lights that were out, a serpentine belt that was beginning to crack, and a cabin filter that looked like it was quite the cozy home for some wild field mice. the manager was able to work out a great deal with me and i was able to get it all taken care of in about 30 minutes. i will most definitely be returning for my next oil change. thank you so much for the outstanding customer service that your professional crew displayed so flawlessly!!"
1-star,0,"i've taken my car here for oil changes and tire rotations (every other visit) since i moved here 6 years ago. they're slightly cheaper than the dealer, and their up sell is actually a little less pressured. but...they would always pressure me to get a cabin air filter...until i looked online and saw that the dirty filter they showed me was a different shape and had a different frame than the one in my car. they stopped the upsell after that. then, i started having performance problems with my tires. the tires were new when i started going to jiffy lube, so all of the rotations were done with them. the tires only had 30k miles on them and they were 60k tires. i know they can wear early, but that is really early. they became unbalanced during pothole season. it was more convenient for me to take the car into my husband's long used tire place, so i did, and they said my tires were so unevenly worn it looked like they had never been rotated. they had to be replaced. that explains my poor performance! but, jiffy lube lost me as a customer."
2-star,0,"they do a competent job and, its true, you're in and out in under 30 minutes. even so, i'm not a fan because they like to nickel and dime you for extras. each time i've been there, i've had the person on the computer will breeze through options without explaining the cost difference between the different types of oil. the most infuriating thing is when they say something like ""we recommend that you get your radiator fluid flushed at x miles. would you like to do that today?"" when they can clearly see that my car is 15,000 miles from that benchmark. why would i get a service that isn't recommended? their approach to customer service is bizarre."
1-star,0,"they lost me as a customer when they told me i was 2 months late for my oil change...according to my millage i had 500 miles to go. they said i have to get my oil changed every 3 months, and not to go by millage. i have been going by millage since i started driving. i never drive 3,000 miles in 3 months. i called around to ask if i couldn't go by millage then what is the point of writing it down? and everyone told me they were just trying to get more money out of me by having me come in more often for oil changes. i may be a female, but i'm not stupid and i don't appreciate being misled and taken advantage of. i will not be returning to this location for anything."
5-star,1,"my experience at jiffy lube was awesome!!! have not been in any jiffy lube lately but today's visit will have me back as a regular customer. jason greeted us very well. right away service advisor josue, approached me and in details he went over type of oil that was gonna be used for my lexus. made me feel i was in right place. tyler cleaned up my car and also very attentive. overall service and staff did a phenomenal job. definitely two thumbs up...."
5-star,1,good excellent service like how the guys are actually doing there job and neatly upper and lower bay crew like how they worked on my raptor quick and excellent service really recommend this location for excellent and fast services good experience definitely continue going
1-star,0,watch these guys bait and switch. tried to tell me i have had a 94.00 oil change. always had the 47. 00 oil change. made them look up previous one ant they got caught would not recommend will turn the them ini
1-star,0,i came in for a simple oil change. typical of these locations they want you to spend more money on non needed items. i told them no just a simple oil change. then they said it would $70 dollars. wth? they said it's because i drive a lot. i said no i just wanted the basic oil change which brought down to $54 plus i had a $10 coupon $44 bucks. will not be coming back to this establishment.
5-star,1,went there for an oil change. i was in and out in 20 minutes. i lost my coupon. they looked it up for me and still honored it. they had snacks and a cooler filled with drinks for tue customers. the guys also helped me find out why my car was over heating; free of charge. great service.
5-star,1,best oil change place in town. so honest and upfront definitely do not rip the customer offer and they get you in and out quickly. will definitely return.
1-star,0,horrible management took my car in to do a oil change and do my registration when i get there they broke the top of the oil dipstick off leaving the dipstick in the tube after they had already drained my car of oil and then did not inform me that they had drained my car of oil and i had been driving around with no oil in the car then they would not take responsibility stating that there were no cameras in the garage and no way for me to prove that they drained the oil don't go to any jiffy lube especially this one horrible service don't care.
5-star,1,"they are quick and helpful, very informative didn't leave me hanging when i needed more expensive oil told me before they put it in."
1-star,0,"dont ever come here if you are looking for an oil change. i have been bringing my car here to get an oil change for quite sometime with no issues, until last week 5/17/17 i noticed my car was making a noise and i decided to take it to the dealer for the oil change and a quick inspection, mind you my car is 2016 and has berly any miles so there shouldn't be any issues, when the guy at the dealer began to change my oil he called me to show me how much oil was missing from my car and how my original filter had never been changed !!!! ever i trusted these people to do there job bc the oil changes where 100$ plus turns out i was just being scammed.... to top it of i called to try and figure out what was going on and one of the managers ""grant"" said "" we'll call corporate if you have an issue ........... bc there's no way no one can tell if we changed your oil or not scammers !"
5-star,1,"i pulled in yesterday for a quick smog check right before closing. the customer service was far better than even at my luxury car dealership where i usually go. i was thoroughly impressed with grant and the rest of the staff. they were professional, friendly, and extremely helpful. the waiting area was clean and comfortable. i highly recommend this jiffy lube."
4-star,1,changed oil and transmition fluid the other day. they too real good care of my truck she's on older mold with a lot of miles. they always are willing to go the extra mile to help her stay on the road longer.
1-star,0,this location is terrible. it took 2 hours for an oil change and tire rotation. i've been coming here for 3 years and will not return after this experience. no one even apologized for the wait.
1-star,0,"im starting to notice a serious difference between the service i got at jiffy lube back in reno, vs what i'm getting now in the las vegas area. my first experience was service that took about 45 minutes. ordinarily this wouldn't be a big deal but back in reno i go so used to 5-10 minute oil changes that it caught me off guard and made me late back to work. what really ticked me off though is that when i sent my wife in to get her oil changed they charged her $100. she didn't know any better and didn't even think to ask me and i didn't find this out until i noticed the charge on the bank statement."
2-star,0,"i came in for a smog check and oil change. this was the second time i've come in for a smog check in the last month and their smog guy was out both times (they only have one?). the oil change itself was fine, although they didn't ask me what weight i wanted (my car uses synthetic, but allows several weights). they didn't reset my car's oil change maintenance mileage counter. so as soon as i started it, my car told me it was time for an another oil change. they reset it once i asked them to do it. not a big deal, but customers shouldn't have to ask - right? their windshield sticker said to come back for another oil change in 5000 miles when 15k is recommended by the manufacturer of my car. the jiffy lube recommended 5k is, of course, so they'll make more money. that's common among oil change places (not just jiffy lube), but annoying and i view it as lying. at the least, it doesn't build trust in them as someone i should let help maintain my car. the biggest strike against jiffy lube this visit was oily hand prints on my door, left front fender and front of my hood. additionally, the right front fender had oily marks from their fender pad in the shape of a long rectangle with 5 quarter-sized circular oil marks in the middle of it. i tried to wipe them off with the inside of my shirt, but the oil just smeared (because, you know, it's oil). i didn't ask them to clean the oil off the car, but come on dudes!? fwiw, afterwards i stopped by jiffy smog at the chevron just down the street. their smog check was quick & painless."
2-star,0,"two months after purchasing my vehicle, i got my oil changed at this location. 5 days later or so, my engine just stopped. had it towed to a shop where the mechanics said it was 2.5 quarts low. jiffy lube said to bring it to a different shop to verify if it was indeed their fault. this second shop said they couldn't find a leak where oil was coming out of. turns out my engine had both a spun rod bearing and a spin main bearing. i can only assume this is because no oil or at least not enough oil was put back into my engine. edit: talked to mark, discussed the reason my claim was denied. i can appreciate the people who work hard and who take the time to talk you through the specific problems. adding a star for customer service."
2-star,0,"jiffy? not so much. only 2 docks were full, so pulled right in. then proceeded to wait a good hour in the sweltering office for a basic oil change. was not shown my filter so who knows if they really changed it. no coffee, no magazines. did i mention no air conditioning? never ever coming here again."
1-star,0,i'm sitting here now at this jiffy lube and have been for the past hour and a half. i came in for a simple oil change. it took them over 45 minutes to even check me in. it's been another 45 minutes and my oil change still isn't done. don't come here if you're looking for something quick. i can't comment on the prices yet because i haven't even gotten the bill.
5-star,1,"first time at this location and i will definitely be a regular here! came in for an oil change and they topped my fluids, put air in my tires, vacuumed the inside, and wiped my windows inside and out!!! customer service was awesome as well!!! wish that they had more stars to give them!!! over exceeding my expectations!!!"
5-star,1,"popped in to see if they had time to do my oil change, was on a time crunch. fit me in and had me in and out within 25 min. awesome. thanks guys!"
5-star,1,having been getting my oil changed at many jiffy lubes. george took amazing care of me. i will definitely bring my car here from here on!!!
5-star,1,very good store i came in for a top off and george helped me out. very nice guy had a warm greeting when i drove up. will definitely be back and i highly recommend this store.
5-star,1,really great crew especially george! they always take care of me and are always honest about what i need on my car and make sure my car is running smoothly when i leave here. i will always come back to this location as long as i live in vegas!
1-star,0,"i stopped to get my oil changed because i saw they have 3 big banners across the front of the building that say $24.99 and i thought that was a good price. the guy tells me to get out of the car and he shows me where the waiting area is and tells me they will get started in a few minutes, there are 3 oil changing bays and only one other car which means that there should have been no wait time at all but 5 minutes later they pull my car into the bay. the guy comes in the waiting area and asked me to come into the oil changing area because he needs my information due to this being my first time there, i give him the information he needs then he asks me to choose the oil type i want but he tells me my car takes synthetic oil at the price of $89.99. i told him i've had my car 3 years and not even the dealership where i bought it put synthetic oil in it so please just put regular oil in. he then gives me my total of $42.99 so i asked him why i'm being charged $42.99 when they have 3 banners that say $24.99 and he tells me it's because my car takes a special type of oil filter. again i told him that not even the dealership told me this so i told him not to do the oil change and i left. first he tries to make me buy the expensive oil and when that didn't work he tried charging me for an expensive oil filter without even telling me first. the thing these people don't seem to understand is that if you're honest with the customers, the customers will give good reviews and keep coming back but if the business lies and cheats then the customers will give bad reviews and never go back to that business again. so instead of making $24.99+tax from me and gaining future business from me they got $0.00 from me, no future business from me and another bad review."
1-star,0,i have used jiffy lube before so after moving to henderson nv i went to this location. took over one hour and they were not busy. find another location this one not professional i will not return.
5-star,1,"i have been a customer at this location for about 8 years. george baca and the employees have been nothing but very helpful and courteous to me. everytime i arrive there, someone always greets me, ask how they can help me. they are very accomodating and always lets me know how long my car will take and gives me status on my car. thanks for the wonderful service jiffy lube."
1-star,0,"worst service ever! the night i went to get an oil check and get a check up, my head lights would not turn off nor would they even go on high beams anymore. i have to constantly unplug my battery so it wouldn't die over night and then plug it back in the following day. i went back today and asked to fix it and they just blew me off! my car has never had anything wrong with it up until they touched it. i highly suggest not going to this place! they will add problems to your car and say they didn't do anything to cause it."
1-star,0,"just started with my complaints. bottom line took my car in for an oil change. went back the next day for a leak. went back the next day for the same leak. the manager apologized gave me 1/2 off my next oil change said he wanted to make it right. couldn't be nicer. later that day noticed i still had a leak. went back to get everything they had done in writing because clearly i need to take the car to the dealership. his jacket said ""manager"" he claimed to be the assistant manager, refused to sign anything. refused to include the work they had done the day before because ""he wasn't there"". save yourselves and your cars!! do not go to jiffy lube!!!! i will be contacting corporate, the franchise owner and countless others!!!"
1-star,0,"got my oil changed, noticed puddles of oil under the car after they worked on it. left the lot and also noticed gauge was still on for fluid levels. took it back week later after new puddles continued. the guy who checked me in clearly tried to bs me. when i called him on it and left the lot to go somewhere else their manager walked after my car yelling at me to have a good day and see you next time. no cussing but the vibe was the same. avoid! next place took me under the car and showed me how the drain plug wasn't even tightened. recommended i watch for compression issues which is a legit concern. but my car has regular maintenance and given it ran fine prior to these guys getting a hold of it, i think it's clear what happened. again avoid! update 3/10/13 not a compression problem. car's in primo shape. it was these idiots who can't tighten a basic screw."
1-star,0,these guys r a bunch of con artists and they take forever to do shit i usually go to the one on sahara but i moved and these guys ran my smog took them 20mins to give me an answer im gettin my oil changed at the old one i rather drive then sit around and be cheated on by these slow ass workers
5-star,1,"after my dr visit, i stopped by here to get my smog check. this jiffy lube impressed me, even more so then the other one on windmill. this place looks newer, cleaner, 8 or so more comfy leather like chairs to sit, clean sparkling coffee machine, water...impressive the staff was quick to get the cars in and out with quality work. i was in and out of that place in a jiff...oh how funny...jiffy lube...dohhh, that's how it should be right? this place is walking the talk fo shizzle. i will be returning to this jiffy lube for my car service. note: there is also a dq in walking distance, and i wouldn't even need to cross a busy street! kudos to this location!"
2-star,0,"been here for years. my dad always had me take my car or his car in for oil changes in high school and it was great. the prices were fair. $45-50 usually. i'm currently taking my fiancé's car in for an oil change and the representative is telling me it's $100 for oil change. now, i don't know if it's my fiancé's car, since it is very old. but i get my oil change at zimbrick, and it's $25 and i drive a 2016 model. obviously i went with the oil change as she needs it for work, but not happy."
5-star,1,"always had stellar service, and they sure come off as more competent and trustworthy than the jeep dealership on odana. i use them for everything i can."
1-star,0,don't come here if you are in a hurry. i thought a jiffy meant fast. 3 guys changing my oil as i sat there for 45 minutes. i was the only customer there. said my oil filter was too hard to reach but the place i usually go to gets it done in 15 minutes.
1-star,0,service was great cause no one was there. i drove right in and then was told not to. they asked for my keys and then proceeded to tell me i was wrong to just pull in! well maybe if someone would have been out there directing me i wouldn't have done that! not happy with the $50 bucks i was robbed of for a basic oil change!!
5-star,1,"i went here for a quick service oil change. it's a first come first serve basis, but i only waited about 20-25 min even with one person in front of me. the staff was very knowledgable and extra friendly starting when i pulled in. after finishing up with the car and giving me the run down, the man helping me (chris) checked my car again because i was concerned about a light. everyone there went out of their way to help and i will be going back!"
2-star,0,"i really wanted to give them a good review. i went in in march for an oil change, and they tried to sell me new air filters. i passed because the car had recently undergone an overhaul. i thought that was the end of the story. about a month later, my car started leaking oil. i took it in to this location because they were the last to look at it. they said they fixed it, and on top of that, i got a very patronizing talk about how ""we discussed getting a new oil plug, but [i] didn't want one."" that just wasn't true, but thanks for blaming me here. three months pass where i think they've fixed it, but lo and behold, the car starts leaking oil again. i take it back again, and am told there is all new staff at this location. good? after waiting for two hours, i learn the last group replaced the oil plug, but they used the wrong type. i ""should have the right type now. and we've changed your oil free of charge because you were due."" not 48 hours passed before it started leaking oil again. i really wanted to give them a good review because on the last visit, they were very apologetic and did the work free of charge. the work just didn't work."
1-star,0,"i thought that i had a great experience here. i mean, they were open on labor day, cheaper than my dealer for an oil change, and the representative that assisted me was nice enough. i thought i liked this place until i went for an oil change with my dealer at my 5k check up. it appears that jiffy lube made a few mistakes in changing my oil. i found out that they screwed some cap on too tight. this does not seem like a big deal but i found out that this would cost $540 if my dealer was not able to remove it. i was also told that the wrong filter was used. fortunately however, the dealer was able to remove the cover but the stress of dealing with that hassle is what ruined the experience for me. that visit will be my last time ever visiting a jiffy lube."
5-star,1,"stopped in real quick for oil change, service was too notch. tonia was very knowledgeable and polite, informative with extra services offered. felt very taken care of and impressed with a females extensive knowledge about cars. coming back soon."
5-star,1,this place is hands down the best place to go! i have had a lot of bad experiences at a lot of other places and this is on the absolute opposite side of the spectrum. i started going here about a year and a half ago and i don't plan on going anywhere else. the service is fast and good. the employees are fantastic. they aren't pushy when they let you know about the other services they offer and they are very diligent but to make sure you know what's out there. will always recommend this location and the employees that work there.
5-star,1,"very friendly. staff was direct with recommendations outside of the oil change that i had came for, but also did a nice job of explaining repairs/replacements that could be held off on. when they noticed something was wrong with my car, they brought me out to the car, showed me the broken piece, explained what the part is for and what happens if not replaced, and then offered an estimate for repair. did a thorough job of vacuuming my car and cleaning the windows in addition to the oil change. i'm definitely going back to them and will be recommending them to family/friends that live close by."
5-star,1,great customer service. very friendly people. huge selection..tom duluc you are awesome. finally i bought my livinglite 8.4s truck camper and im satisfied with the purchase. smoth transaction. i had to drive all the way from ca to ohio to make my dream come true. now my family and i will enjoy this beautiful camper. thank you kamper city.
5-star,1,"i bought a 2017 retro 176s. i'm in love with this camper! but the reason why i'm in love is due to rick listening to what i wanted in a camper! my husband and i were looking for a toy hauler, but everyone knows i. love. shasta's! well we weren't finding the toy hauler of our dreams so i went back to see them and rick says: "" did you see that red one out there?"" i said ""no, i haven't found a retro i liked"" he said i should just go take a look and reluctantly i did so.... well! (lol!) it was a size of retro i hadn't seen before. just like a shasta but has a slide for the dinette! hooray!!!! i was blown away by how this team listens to the customer! the finance team heard me too! they got me payments that fit my budget and my camper is now in its forever home! i love my camper and the staff at kamper city are now family!"
5-star,1,just purchased a used travel trailer from them. they worked with on us price that i believe we were all happy with. did everything they could do to make us happy and understand what we purchased and how to use it.
5-star,1,"my husband and i just bought a camper from kamper city after dealing with an extremely rude sales staff over at camping world. we dealt with rick, who was great and easy to work with. i appreciate the fact that he's a straight shooter like me, he made it easy to choose between the two campers we were looking at. i had a minor issue that had nothing to do with our sales person, and it was promptly dealt with by management. i was extremely pleased. having grown up with a father who has worked in upper management my whole life, i believe in the ""the customer is always right"" motto and clearly the management side of kamper city does as well. all around great customer service and nice campers on the lot."
5-star,1,"recently (october 26, 2017) i had my rv winterized and the entry steps lubricated and adjusted. the service was performed promptly and professionally. the service tech took the time to explain what he did and i felt assured the work was complete and done correctly. while waiting in the customer service room, i had the opportunity to speak with both the owner and the sales manager, who were welcoming and very knowledgeable about the business. these guys know rv's! i would definitely recommend kamper city if you are looking to buy an rv or have it serviced."
2-star,0,"i had an awning replaced on my pop-up camper. they were very nice. hilarious installation mistakes ensued. they installed the awning hardware backward on the canvas, which made setting it up extremely confusing because the poles that go toward the ground were angled toward the pop-up, and those that were supposed to be attached to the pop-up were pointing at the ground. if you attached those poles to the pop-up, you would have to break the hardware to orient the other poles at the ground. when that was figured out and reversed (an easy process), it became clear that the anchor points were installed in the wrong place. i found the installation manual online and sure enough, the anchor points go under the awning at the top of the pop-up, not under the canvas you snap onto the pop-up when it's popped up. in hindsight, how can you attach an awning pole through the canvas? should i have cut a hole? i remounted the anchor points myself, but now i have 4 little holes (from the screws) in the side of my pop-up i have to fill with caulk."
5-star,1,"we just purchased our 2nd camper. jason was our sales person again and as always very helpful. this is definitely the place to purchase you camper. staff are always very nice and eager to help. the owner is really a great guy, very friendly ! thank you kamper city for all that you do for us campers.."
1-star,0,"wow. and i thought i was the only one who had problems with kamper city. as another customer wrote here, this is a family business ruined by the family members. such rudeness. such arrogance. you'd think it was an upscale boutique by the way they treat people. maybe no one told the owners that they own a camper lot spelled with a ""k""? i suggested to my friend that he go elsewhere for his purchase. he did and he was very pleased with both the service and the product. some businesses care about their customers and their image; unfortunate kamper city (with a ""k"") is not one of them. avoid."
1-star,0,"have you ever dealt with a fine, family run establishment that takes care of their customers and works hard to earn your business by going the extra mile? kamper city is the opposite. i was greeted by a rude salesperson. told to wait for a manager who never came, so i left. trying to negotiate with ""ol tom"" is laughable at best. you'd expect any rational human who lists a used rv $700 over the blue book value to at least negotiate with you. nope, not at kamper city. after employing all the worn out ""used car salesman"" tactics like making you wait an absurd amount of time to consider an offer, he countered with... his original sticker price. i wish i had read all the online reviews before showing up on the lot. seems like i'm not the only one with a terrible experience. im actually glad he turned down my offer, seems like their warranty department is abysmal. it's truly remarkable that these guys are even in business. if they were the last rv dealership on earth, id rather tow around a cardboard box with a pillow in it than deal with them."
5-star,1,"we have just purchased our third trailer coming from kamper city. jason was our salesperson and he did a great job. showed us just what we wanted in 3 trailers they had. the owner helped us make a deal that was good for both of us. we did our walk through today, added a few extras we wanted and left with our new (2012) trailer. the guys helping install the extras worked hard and fast. great place to but, check them out if looking for an rv."
1-star,0,"buyer beware! worst customer service! i purchased a camper in july. several things were wrong from the beginning. the dvd player does not work; they forgot to give us our screen door; they delivered the camper completely filthy; we noticed small puddles on the floor in the bathroom and living room on several occasions; the slide makes a grinding sound then it seems to ""pop"" into the next gear. i called and left countless messages for the service manager. now we have severe water damage! water is coming through the light fixtures, mold is forming on the walls. it's a mess. when i called the owner, he told me to call my insurance company. i explained i have a warranty on the camper and i can't seem to get the service manager to assist me. he didn't even acknowledge that the service manager had a responsibility to call customers back. but he did say that no warranty ever covers water and whatever damage that has been caused is due to something that i did! his comments were rude, uncalled for and completely wrong! i contacted the manufacturer. they too, were completely appalled by his responses. i will have to work with them for a resolution. lesson learned - i will never buy a camper from kamper city again!"
5-star,1,"kamper city saved our vacation. we did something stupid when hooking up our travel trailer to our tow vehicle and encountered a problem on i71. we were lucky to be approaching an exit, and pulled off the highway and into the closest parking lot. i made two calls for help. place number one was helpful, but advised us to call kamper city because they were much closer. kamper city advised us what we could do to try to limp the 10 miles or so to get to them. fingers crossed, we took our time and made it to them they helped us out and charged us a very fair price. an hour after we arrived at kamper city, we were all set, and back on the road to start our vacation. if the were closer to home, they would always be my choice for service."
5-star,1,"honesty, integrity and fair pricing. lorenzo and his team sets the standard for what all automotive maintenance shops should strive to emulate. they are confident in their abilities and willing to take on projects others would not. if you are a tuner; use this shop for after market installs of basic parts. they do great work and will never gouge you. lorenzo installed ecms on both my alfa and bmw. i will never use another shop for my automotive needs. now if i could only convince them to open a body shop."
1-star,0,"this place makes you think they will solve the problems you bring your car in with, but i left with the same issues and less money. went there to fix my power steering which leaks everywhere to the point i can't park in driveways and i'm constantly filling it, but they didn't even check that for leaks. and needed my check engine light off, got the part it needed installed and left with it still on. thanks."
5-star,1,"i first heard of knudsen's when i moved into the area and needed an oil change. they were the closest auto shop in the area and had incredible reviews. then i got a coupon in the mail for a $20 oil change, so i booked an appointment. i'm from a small town in wisconsin, and am used to family-like service. that's exactly what i got from knudsen's!!! as soon as i walked in, i was greeted with a smile and great service. the work was just as great! i was worried about getting scammed over a cheap coupon, but it was just the opposite. the shop is clean, lorenzo is the best, and the service is unbeatable. honest service, but no pressure to spend money you don't have. once, they didn't have the correct filter for my oil change and i had to wait a little longer than usual- so they gave it to me complimentary. definitely not your typical auto shop!! i have recently moved out of arizona, and i will miss the amazing service that knudsen's gave me for the past 2 years. thanks for everything, lorenzo!! p.s. if you live close and get the coupons in the mail, gather a few and use them!! so worth it"
5-star,1,"amazing! 2 thumbs up! genuine and authentic service by lorenzo and the guys! lorenzo was very personable and kind. we own a 1973 gmc that needed work. he was very excited to help us and check out our vehicle. he did work only that needed to be done and saved us money. he gave us advice on our truck and referred us to an awesome muffler guy. while the guys were working on the truck, we used the lot vehicle to get around. everything about this experience was unreal, and unlike any mechanic encounter we have had before. we now consider lorenzo a friend and will go to the shop for any work we need!!!"
5-star,1,"look no further - this shop is honest and they genuinely care about customer satisfaction and returning customer business. case in point: one year ago i brought my vehicle in and it needed two new engine mounts. the manager at the time put aftermarket mounts in my vehicle. exactly one year later, those parts failed and i was back at square one today, facing another expensive repair. when i told the new manager lorenzo that i'd had my car in one year ago for the exact same problem, he secured higher quality (aka manufacturer) mounts for my car and credited the expense of the more costly aftermarket parts back to me. this significantly reduced the cost of the repair. i was also allowed to use their shop car so i didn't have to rent a vehicle, miss work, or incur the costs of ride sharing around the city. he certainly didn't have to do those things, but by doing them, he has ensured that i will continue to give knudsen's repeat business and refer others to the shop as well. it's hard sometimes to not feel like you're getting fleeced when you take your vehicle into a mechanic. at knudsen's, i can trust that i'm getting the most for my money and that if something does go wrong with the repair, they will take care of me."
5-star,1,"we were traveling from out of town and our a/c stopped blowing cold air... not a good look when the daily temperature is roughly 110 degrees. i contacted lorenzo from knudsen's and was very quickly taken care of. the shop was clean and service was fast. if i am ever in the area with another vehicle issue, knudsen's will be my first call."
5-star,1,very happy i came here. took me in right away for an oil change even though they where busy. prices where very fair and customer service was excellent.
1-star,0,"i bought my car in on what i believed was a warranty issue; lorenzo said he would take a look at it and contact me with the findings. he called me and told me that (in my error) it was not a warranty issue after all. that was my mistake. when i went to pick up the car, he told me i'd have to pay 120.00 for a ""diagnostic"" review. he never told me that when i dropped off the car. being on a limited income, i certainly would have discussed that with him had he told me that beforehand. when i explained i didn't have 120.00 and that he never told me that, he became very condescending and insulting. there were people in the lobby, and he intimated that it was my fault, and that i didn't give him a chance to explain there was a charge when i dropped off the car. that is totally untrue. he never stated there would be a charge and his attitude was very unsettling."
5-star,1,"i've been coming here for over 20 years and have never been disappointed. quality work, intergrity and very reasonable prices."
5-star,1,"parents were visiting from in when the brakes on their van started grinding. called knudsen's, based on yelp reviews and location. received a reasonable quote over the phone. dropped the van for repair and got a call less than an hour later that the van didn't need brakes, it was simply missing a bolt to the caliper. service is honest and impressive. the repair was no charge and even cleaned the inside. thank you!!!"
5-star,1,after no one could figure out why my air conditioner wasn't working i came across this garage- and in no time they had the problem pinpointed - yay!!! i'm on the dave ramsey plan so no new car for me- and i don't fret. between my boyfriends knowledge of cars for the things that he can maintain-its good knowing that i have these guys in case there is an event when we r not able to either figure out the fix or it's too labor intensive- i trust them - and am glad i no longer have to look any further than here to keep my 2 older models on the road till i'm debt free!!!
5-star,1,"woke up with a dead battery and other car issues, and a two yr old grandson watch. looked on yelp and found knudsen auto repair. called and they said come on in and they would help me! they were busy, but made time to fix my car. they said ""if you can't trust us to help in an emergency, how would you trust us with routine needs? super friendly staff, clean shop and very reasonable prices. i will be moving here soon, and just found my mechanics!"
5-star,1,"bought some oem take-off alloys and tires to replace the originals on my 3-year-old explorer. knudsen's swapped my tps sensors to the new wheels (dismounting 2 sets of tires and remounting and balancing one) in just over an hour at a great price. excellent service, clean, organized shop. my new go-to place! thanks, lorenzo!"
5-star,1,i was having trouble with a different automotive shop installing parts incorrectly and not being honest with everything going wrong with my car. so i decided to take it in to knusens for a second opinion. within 30 minutes they found the problem(rack and pinion). and had me back on the road the next day! great service and the fixed it fast
5-star,1,"all i can say is wow, great professional service. yesterday i was telling my wife i needed a front end alignment on my pick-up after i replaced the ball joints. she showed me a mailer from knudsens and the price seemed great. i made an appointment and am thoroughly pleased with the entire experience. clean waiting room and shop, on time appointment and no surprises. professionals to say the least. i will be back."
5-star,1,kudos to lorenzo and team. he got me in quickly (same day) and i feel confident with the services they provided. i felt the pricing was very fair. waiting room is clean and comfortable. i am grateful for their attention to detail and i will be back! :)
4-star,1,"time for an oil change and i happen to get a coupon for knudsen's. this is the neatest, cleanest car shop. the service was prompt and the walls are filled with better business bureau, aaa top ratings. the shop area looks orderly and clean. okay. my new go to shop."
5-star,1,"wow! talk about great customer service. it was beyond great. we just moved to the moon valley area and got a welcome package and in it was a gift certificate for a free oil change, filter, tire rotation. i called at 4pm on a wednesday and asked when the soonest was i could get in and they told me tomorrow and i said bummer i was hoping to get in today. lorenzo immediately said you know what, come on down and i'll work you in today! i got there and was greeted instantly with a big smile and a nice facility with cold air conditioning (mid july ac is important) and my entire service was completed in less than 45 min. highly recommend them and was very happy. thank you guys! i found my new place to have my vehicles serviced."
5-star,1,"great auto shop and really good people. new management is so much better, can't say enough good about this shop and it's employees. thank you again for everything!"
1-star,0,"came in to get my brakes done and an oil change, asked specifically for synthetic oil . after 4 hours i got my car back and they hadn't even done the brakes, so i had to wait another 2 hours for that service to be completed . only to find out a week later they hadn't put synthetic oil in my car . i called and they told me i could come back in to flush the engine and put synthetic in, but who has another 4 hours to waste on these clowns . so i took it to have it done at cobblestone and they were able to wrap it up in 30 min with a car wash . i don't recommend this place to anyone . complete waste of time and money ."
5-star,1,"first and foremost... this is an honest review. knudsen's is probably not the cheapest place you can get your car worked on. sure, you can take your car to some fly by night mechanic and maybe save a few bucks. but... if you want genuine great overall experience with high quality repair and a fair price, then this is your place. i came across knudsen's by recommendation from my aunt. i brought my acura rsx type s in because my car had suddenly started violently vibrating all over. the steering wheel, the seats. the car was noisy inside the car. i suspected a motor mount issue, and my hunch was correct. knudsen's discovered that my last mount had failed. i needed all motor mounts and 1 tranny mount replaced. i was looking at a $1000 repair with parts and labor. luckily they accept aftermarket auto warranties... so the 3 year, 36,000 mile warranty i bought with the car covered the majority of the repair. considering waiting on approval from the warranty company, and special order of my parts, my car was in and out in about 24 hours. happy with the service and i will return."
5-star,1,"one of my go to shops. knudsen's literally defines what a small family business should be. my dad has trusted lyle with his cars for over a decade, and he's been doing mine since i started driving. the service is quick, the work is done correctly the first time, and lyle and the staff will keep you informed on what they're doing to your car, and why. most of the time i need parts i buy them from lyle, as i like to give him the business. the few times it made more sense to provide my own parts lyle was more than willing to do the install for me, and wasn't offended. he's played both sides of the fence, and understands the customers perspective. they're all car guys to the bone. one thing that really stands out for is the several times i've heard lyle tell customers that they didn't need something, or directs them to a cheaper option. i think it says a lot about the integrity of the shop that lyle doesn't feel the need to up sell. he makes enough money through honest hard work and repeat business that he doesn't need to gouge you. as far as i am concerned, that defines good business. overall, great place. we all want an honest and fair mechanic, and knudsen's embodies everything a great auto shop should be."
5-star,1,i had great customer service here. i called and got a free oil change and when i got there they were all nice and great conversation with them. i got a quote with some things i wanted to add to my truck. and they were lower in price then another place i went to by $400.00 i will be going there to add some things to my truck. thanks
5-star,1,"absolutely wonderful. i was having an awful day hit a curb and bent my rim. i went here because it was my closest option. i arrived. they said they were full but would take a quick look and see what they could do. a gentleman came over about twenty minuets later. took my wheel off. banged up the rim and ran a quick leak test on it and was done. i was astonished. i walked back into the main room to pay. the gentleman asked what he did, i told him and said ""how much do i owe you?"" he said "" nothing just go tip him."" wonderful service. thank you !"
5-star,1,"i was on my way home from work late one night and my two front tires went flat! i pulled into the parking lot as they were closing and they re-opened their shop and filled up my tires to make sure i could get home okay even with a slow leak. even better, the mechanic called my dad (who has also been a long time customer of knudsen's) to make sure that i got home safely. i, of course, needed to get my tires replaced and they were able to price match and get me a good deal. i will continue to go here for my auto repairs and tune ups and i would definitely refer all my friends and family because this is clearly a company that cares about their customers!"
4-star,1,got a new battery for the 91 ford pick up and they are just around the corner. i love convenience. then went to run errands and the brakes went out. they fixed them the same day at a very good price. thank you!!!!!
2-star,0,"after spending $600 and making 3 trips to replace several parts knudsen's still had not identified the reason my check engine light was on. lyle had scanned the diagnostic codes again and was going to call but never did. took it to 3a automotive on hatcher rd where they correctly diagnosed the fault in less than an hour and for under $100. i believe knudsen's is an honest shop and a good bunch of guys but their prices are high, the diagnosis flawed, and no follow up or consideration for their mistakes."
5-star,1,"if you're looking for an honest, dependable and knowledgable auto mechanic, look no further!!! these guys are wonderful. seriously the best mechanics in town. i would never go anywhere else for car service."
5-star,1,"been with lyle knutsen for 20 years. always been my source for reliable fast quality auto work. never backed up and usually big and small jobs started that day, little ones finished same. fixed my flat tires for free, always saved me money on the dealership. can't say enough - if i could, i'd leave him to my son in my will."
4-star,1,i got a free oil change certificate from them in the mail. hard to pass that up! decent place for basic service on tires and oil.
5-star,1,i have now have had 5 vehicles tinted at lms. from minivan to sports car they have it covered. the quality materials last as long as you own your car. oscar was easy to deal with and gave me a fair price.
5-star,1,great service and awesome work. affordable and friendly. would definitely recommend. has tinted 2 of my cars now and it's been perfect.
5-star,1,great service! oscar was awesome! i didn't know there were so many options and he explained all the differences to me and answered all my questions. they finished my car in a few hours. he explained the aftercare perfectly as well. i would definitely recommend this place to anyone who isn't looking to pay a crazy amount for a great job and excellent service. i will be telling all of my friends to come here.
5-star,1,i went to this company based on a recommendation from a friend. they were professional and did a great job on tinting my vehicle.
5-star,1,"drove across town just because the service was amazing the guys are great and my car is now keeping the sun out . looking for a place to tint your windows for a reasonable price, fast and friendly service this is where you need to be . i love my car even more now"
5-star,1,"george, oscar and their all star crew have earned my loyal business ever since the first time tint after i moved here 2003. since then they have done stereo systems, and great tint jobs. totally professional and dependability!! they have been here and will always be here if you ever have issues. which i never had any problems at all! their attention to detail is what keeps this military man always coming back. speaking of military, they always offer a military discount! get it tinted at lms!! get it banging at lms!!"
5-star,1,"these guys where great! my stereo and car alarm stop working one day. i was afraid it was something major, turns out my radio blew a fuse. took them less than 30 minutes to diagnose and installed the new fuse. definitely will come back when i upgrade to a new stereo system!"
2-star,0,drop off your car at opening expecting your car to be first in line? not. walk in and you jump to the front of the line. overrated and overpriced.
1-star,0,"after having windows tinted here i needed stereo repair. what they did was sell me on a unit that wouldn't play my dvd, then tried to upsell me to a cheap quality dvd player. i already had a dvd player, all i needed was repair! i learned by my experience here that they do not repair, they can only replace! that, is not a technician, that is an assembler. my 8 yr old granddaughter actually fixed the radio!! i had them put it back in. ha ha ha ha! find an 8 yr old, they are more equipped to fix and repair than lms."
5-star,1,took all my 3 cars here and they do an excellent and badass job of installing tints. i recommend to the public. i'm getting my stereo installed next because i have factory stereo. good job guys!
5-star,1,"we got our windows tinted by george and can only say thank you! i no longer have to worry about harmful uv rays and burning sun light. george is very knowledgeable and suggested exactly what we needed for our car. he offers great service and reasonable pricing. we got our 2017 camry tinted, limo in the back and two shades lighter in the front. our car has the radio antenna installed withing the rear window therefore we needed the non-metallized tint. george took the time to explain the difference of each tint, the warranties each offered, and the advantages of each tint. never once did i feel like he was trying to upsell. i personally think in this vegas heat window tint should be mandatory in every vehicle; lms can certainly take care of that for you!"
5-star,1,i was referred here by my service manager at my dealership and he was definitely right about high quality at a great price. the drive to this location was well worth it. i would recommend dropping off your car while they are doing the tint but i did stay in the waiting area the whole time and used the wifi to get some work done. overall great experience and i'll be going back when i purchase my next car.
5-star,1,"lms did a great job with my truck. i had a full size back window decal i wanted taken off my dodge ram 1500 quad cab...it was on the truck when i bought it. they were quick, professional, and inexpensive. spoke with felipe who was pleasant and professional! will definitely use them for my window tint needs."
2-star,0,"i have been here 4 times. they take way too long to tint windows prices are not competitive, and the last time that i bought a stereo it stopped working within 4 months. so, i will no longer use them for stereos but i have not had any issues with the tint. they just take forever to tint eindowa on my cars."
5-star,1,this is an excellent place to get your windows tinted. they do a great job and usually very quick. they also will take care of any problems that you may have with the work that they do. jorge is friendly and makes sure you are satisfied.
4-star,1,jorge was pretty much a straight shooter told me how it is. got both my car's in the next day 3 hours or less for each car not disappointed...yet i was a little upset that they left trash in each car the film strips and sponges but other than that very pleased with the results.
1-star,0,"so this is the garbage a$$ company that prestige dodge sublets to do window tint?? if this is correct, they need to change their contracts. seeing as how i've been waiting 7 hours for my car to get tinted when i had an appointment at 9am. they tell prestige my car should be here in 20 minutes. 1 and a half hours later i'm still waiting. on top of that they screw up the tint twice and have to redo it? are you kidding me?? stevie wonder would've had it done by now. this is garbage! both parties have horrible service!"
5-star,1,"great customer service, speedy service. martin immediately greeted us, assisted us with finding the right tint for our two rubicons. jorge was very informative about the after care, we're very happy."
5-star,1,"jorge and his crew does great work, they have done 2 of my cars, and i will be bringing a third. everyone i have sent to them is very pleased with the great job they do, i can't say enough great things about them."
5-star,1,"i received excellent customer service and same day service. i really wanted to tint my car and had the day off unexpectedly. i called and they said i could drop my car off when they opened. they were very friendly and explained all the different tints they offer. will come back for my other vehicles, thanks jorge and team!"
4-star,1,"after being told different dates i'll receive my amp, i finally got it. you just have to keep in touch with them because they are so busy. but for window tint they are a great place to get it, with other things you'll have to have patience at times it seems."
1-star,0,"i called this place to get my windows tinted they said ""$120 with 3 yr warranty and $159 for lifetime warranty"" ok i thought great who needs more than a 3 year warranty on tint, $120 let's do it! so i go down to drop my car off and that's when the bait and switch happened. i get there and they tell me that the $120 option is with the cheaper film and will fade in about 2 years but i can get the better film for $159. well long story short i ended up leaving because when i called they did not mention anything about different film, just different warranty. i got my tint done for $150 anyways, which is fine since the company was honest when i called and didn't bait and switch me."
5-star,1,excellent and friendly service from staff. answered all my questions and explained all the options before they started the work. my car looks awesome and i am very happy with the work. i will recommend this business to my family and friends.
5-star,1,"we recently bought a used grand caravan that needed new window tinting. lms did a superb job for a very reasonable price. we are very happy with the results and will definitely be referring our friends here. in fact, i want to surprise my husband for christmas with tinting for his car! besides providing a superior service, the owner and employees were friendly and professional. i am a huge supporter of small businesses especially when they can provide a great product at the right price."
5-star,1,"love this place! everyone is very professional, down to earth, & honest. i know nothing about stereo systems and they ""schooled me"" lol i will recommend this business to any & everyone! thx lms!"
5-star,1,"i made an impulsive decision to get my windows tinted. the service was amazing. everyone who worked there was really friendly and helpful. they are reasonably priced! i got 5% tint on all my windows, the front windshield 85%, a car stereo and speakers installed all in one day without an appointment. they don't give you the run around and try to help as best as possible. customer service is their thing! i'm impressed and incredibly happy with my decision!"
5-star,1,"i needed to get the windows tinted on my new car and after looking into a handful of tint shops, i made an appointment here. i picked lms because we've taken some of our fleet cars at work here in the past, and their work always looked good and lasted years so far, still looking the same. i told them that i wanted to drop my car off in the morning and then head back to work, so they asked me to swing by right when they open at 9 am. i arrived the next day 5 minutes early and there were already about 4 people in front of me waiting for the shop to open. i filled out some paperwork, and selected my film and darkness levels. i went with the carbon film, which is their top of the line and comes with a lifetime warranty, all around and a windshield glare strip. i gave them the key and told them to call me on my cell when it was done. i left the shop at about 9:20 am. since there were 4 other cars ahead of me and only 3-4 employees there including the guys that work in the front, i expected it to be a while before they even got to my car. however, at noon i received a phone call from lms saying that my tint was all done and i could pick up my car. wow, already? the tint looks awesome and exactly how i pictured it looking on my car. the workmanship looks great and i didn't even see any bubbles even though they're perfectly normal until the film sets completely, so don't touch or roll down your windows the first week! this shop definitely does high quality work at low prices. don't be fooled by how the shop looks on the outside! the film i got will typically run you about $189 for a 4 door sedan which is comparable to or lower than other places i was looking at, but they'll give you a lifetime warranty no questions asked. i would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking to get their vehicle tinted."
5-star,1,"these guys are great!! on my birthday, i wanted to get my car windows tinted. so, i went on groupon and found a place. before i purchased it, i went up there to see if they can do it today. they told me that they were backed up to september, but if they would suggest anyone, it would be lms. i got there and the guy explained every option for me and answered all my questions. they also told me that they can tint them today. i asked if it would be about 2-3 hours, they said hopefully less than that. they were done a little less than 2 hours. my windows looked great. the guy that was helping me and the owner was very friendly and not pushy at all. they did an excellent job. when i got home, my mom liked them she told me that she wanted to get hers done. so, i told my mom i will take her there for her birthday. lol...."
5-star,1,"just got windows tinted on my 2013 dodge dart and was very impressed by the work done. walked in a little before noon and was out the door in an hour. paid $149 which included a lifetime warranty if any bubbles or mis coloration appears. definitely be back to get my sound system installed as they do alarms tint and sound all at this location. even have wi-fi while you wait. and if you like dogs you can throw their german shepard's ball for him, he's very nice. had a nice experience."
1-star,0,"i just gave these guys a call to see how much it would cost for my car to be done and ask a few questions about the process and the products. i was given the response ""come in and we will talk"" to answer every question i had. extremely frustrating and i will now not bring my car to them because of their inability to simply answer a few questions over the phone."
1-star,0,"stay away from this place,the owner is dishonest and will take every penny without even doing a good job,be aware there are many places in town where you can fix your car and be treated as a vip, he said you won't pay deductible because he knows there are too many body shops so he want to earn your business, he did it once he didn't charge it but then pum!! next time he won't release your car if you don't pay,i'll make sure to tell everyone i know and believe me i know a lot of ppl to stay away from this place, and now he is threatening me about that other deductible from almost a month ago!!!"
5-star,1,"within my one time visit, my experience with this repair shop was just outstanding. customer service is on point. they also managed to help my car out as soon as possible! this place is pretty far for me but it's worth the drive. i was satisfied with the service!"
5-star,1,i have a bmw 750i and i had some issues with with it. the guys at lv auto collision had it fixed fast and for a really reasonable price!!! that was a few weeks ago and it's still running great and looks amazing! thank you guys!!!
5-star,1,so here is the before and after pictures of the damage done by a jerk who rear ended me and flew off! i'm ok karma will get them back!! any way!! shout outs to kevin ( shop manager) who hooked my baby crow (car) @ lv auto collision!! highly recommend friendly service and great work done on my car!! a+ rating on my end!!! thank you guys!! keep up the good work!!
5-star,1,"i brought my vehicle here to have my ac fixed. kevin and the staff were professional, courteous and went the extra mile to help me get back on the road very quickly. they constantly gave me updates and went out of the way to make sure i was comfortable while i waited. i am always hesitant about bringing my car to a new place but this is definitely the spot to come to if you are having any issues. very reasonably priced and very welcoming. i have found my new favorite mechanic!"
5-star,1,these guys here always hook me up with excellent service and very good prices! i got in a wreck and they made my car drive-able for me the same day! these guys are the best.
5-star,1,"this is an awesome shop! the people are friendly, service for me was quick, pricing was great. i will bring all of my bikes here from now on. i definitely recommend it to everyone!"
5-star,1,"if you need anything for your bike this is the shop,dudes are super rad and very helpful they got what you need,also carry vans and some small company apparel it's pretty rad,they do all my work on my bike and i'll never go anywhere else thanks homies!!!!!"
5-star,1,awesome customer service. showed up for a new tire and they got us taken care of and out the door in no time. they also have an great selection of shirts for around 20bucks unlike other shops that you pay $40-50 to advertise their brand. will definitely be back in the future!!
5-star,1,"best service i've ever gotten at a shop. i called brian last week to ask if they could do a weld on kit i bought, without hesitation he told me yes. everyone else i asked to do wouldn't touch a frame. i brought it in yesterday, they told me they'd have it done by this weekend, which was already super good. gave me a tour of the entire shop which made me a lot more comfortable with leaving it with them and then this morning they called and had it done. it hadn't even been there for a day. excellent and quick service. and they did an amazing job on the frame. i cannot speak highly enough of this place. ps. daves the man for the job of you ever need anything welded."
5-star,1,these guys are hands down the best in the business!! i've had my bike worked on quite a bit there and they always have such high quality customer service. they genuinely care about retaining your business and work with honesty and integrity. the shop has a really cool vibe but it's the employees that makes this place a 5 star company.
5-star,1,the people here know what's up i was looking for some specialty bars and know one else out here in phoenix could find them for me. 5 mins into talk with brian and i had them order up they kept me updated with order untill they arrived. the product they have on hand in the shop are pretty rad as well! they only place i'll go too now thanks guys!
5-star,1,"great group of people who are 100% committed to excellent service. you can fully put your trust in them for all your harley davidson wants, and needs. a friend recommended me to this shop, and thankful he did, been ripped off one to many times. going forward, lane splitters will be my go to guys."
5-star,1,"i got in an accident trying to miss hitting a cat that jumped out in front of me. it was my first accident on the bike and i didn't know where to go to get my wheels fixed. i jumped on yelp and lane splitters had some great reviews! i'll tell you this....best decision i ever made. these guys were on it! fixed my bike, kept me informed during the whole process. they also went above and beyond trying to get my bike back to me as they new i would be starting a new job and i would be without wheels. this company cares. i'll always come here for my biking needs. every single person there was kind, knowledgable and you knew that they wanted to help you. miguel, brian and rudy were great! thanks again guys!"
5-star,1,"my 2012 victory had an issue with the rear tire and these guys got me in right away and took care of me. very friendly staff, cool building, good service and prices. i will be back. they've been there about a year and i'm sure for many to come."
5-star,1,let me start off by saying that i am so pleased to be writing this review. miguel and the rest of the guys at the shop are not only over the top professionals but also an awesome group of guys and it shows with their tremendous customer service. i called them after reading their reviews online because my bike was having electrical issues. miguel was extremely friendly and told me that he can't promise anything since its a metric and it could be a ton of different things but to bring it down and they'd try their best to fix it for me. i appreciated the fact that he didn't try and over promise and under deliver just to make a quick buck like a lot of shops do. with that said not only did they completely fix my electrical problems they also made some other adjustments which were needed and i didn't even have to ask for. after having my bike back for a week now i can honestly say it's running better then ever! i would recommend these guys to anyone and on a side note the shop is super cool and they have all kinds of great merchandise. thanks guys i'll be back!
5-star,1,i dropped my 2007 sportster off to be completely overhauled. the staff is amazing. they produced the most beautiful bike you've ever seen! they offer quality work with reasonable prices.
5-star,1,"everyone at lane splitters are super nice, and they definitely know their way around a motorcycle. so if you need some repairs or need some mods done to your bike i highly recommended lane splitters!"
1-star,0,"stay away! the reviews were right! i tried to get the top price ($30) car wash with a tip and it was the worst car wash i've ever had. the touchless machine's do better. after waiting nearly 30 minutes, i went to get in and noticed half the roof, the rear quarter and front quarter were all still filthy. once i got in, i realized they hadn't wiped anything down... barely vacuumed and remained straight dirty. they also let a homeless man not just lean on my car but step in and there was an additional scratch on the car. my car isn't a brand new mercedes but i'm extremely disappointed. i tried to make a point of the issues at the end and they demanded i leave."
1-star,0,"worst hand carwash ever. gave 1star, but even that is a rating that is way to high. they were obviously in a hurry, considering the number of cars waiting. paid for an interior/exterior cleaning and what can i say... poor, poor job. they missed many spots on the exterior and the interior was not well done at all. dash was still dusty as if they did not touch it. control panel was still dusty. carpets were as dirty as before i drove in. mags... well, just take a look at the photos!! horrible. i could have done a better job with a bucket of dirty water and a napkin! will never go back here. better off in a no contact automated carwash. what's the point of getting a hand wash if a machine does a better job. complete waste of time and money."
1-star,0,"first and last time. i've never had a worse car wash. i could've done a better job myself. there was still a bunch of dust and hair in my car, they didn't even clean the main area under the hand break. also, as i was leaving, i saw that my trunk wasn't even cleaned and that it's an extra $2. it would make sense to ask that simple question when arriving or just do it and include it in your price. but equally as bad was how the owner spoke to his employees. i asked them if they can put my rain-x product on my windows and he freaked out telling them not to talk to customers. he then told me i could do it outside myself and that they wouldn't do it. never going back there again!"
1-star,0,"do not go here - ive been here tons and really liked it! but today, i go to get my car cleaned before i sell it/ hand over to the next owner and they ripped off my wiper while cleaning my car!! and then they told me i didn't come in with one! and then they refused to give me a refund! outrageous ! do not use these crooks."
1-star,0,"quel mauvais service! le nettoyage des tapis de mon véhicule a été bâclé. le véhicule a été innondé, et 1000$ de dommage sur les composantes électroniques ont été subis. ce sont des incompetents!"
5-star,1,"i usually go there for the special every now and then and it's perfect. they do it well, quickly and cheaply. but this time i needed to get my car detailed in preparation for the return of my lease inspection. they did an amazing job! they car looked like it was new. it was amazing. i promise i will take the next car there more often!"
5-star,1,"i had a tire blow, and my spare was in no condition to be driven on. i had to get to work, leopold got a new tire on my car super quick and they were extremely hospitable. i'll be coming back when i need new tires all around."
5-star,1,"went in on saturday, and was greeted with a smile. the service was excellent, the price for new tires was reasonable, and the care for my car was apparent in our dealings. i was not upsold at this shop, and was given a proper estimate on the two tires which i needed. this is now my tire shop, and i will not go anywhere else."
5-star,1,dennis and all of the staff there were great and very helpful. my poor tires were so bald and they walked me through the whole process and explained what my car needed. they were very fair on prices and gave me options on which tires i could pick. whole process took less than 2 hours. great group of guys and will be back for sure. and i get free air too!!!
5-star,1,"we stopped in just an hour before they closed, and they took us right in, although we could see there were already people waiting. they diagnosed the problem and fixed the tire quickly and the price was fair. i really appreciate liepold ture"
5-star,1,"this place is the by far the best place to get tires! it's easy to get an appointment. they are trustworthy and they didn't charge for mounting, balancing, disposal, or alighnment. just the tires and tax. they are also friendly and knowledgeable and will rotate your tires for free every 5kmiles."
5-star,1,my family has been coming here for at least the last 25 years. dennis and his crew are the best!!! and they will never lead you astray or over charge you! simply the best and one that i will always trust!!
5-star,1,my daughter took her car to the mechanic he said she need 4 tires and back brakes. i took the car to leipold's and they said the brakes were fine and it only needed two tires. they could have taken me for 3 times what i paid. their integrity is why we keep going back.
5-star,1,"if you are looking for a truly reliable, honest, and reasonably priced place to buy tires, get a tire rotation, balance or alignment, this is the best place!! i discovered them at the recommendation of someone i trust (dave from texas ten) and they have always done an outstanding job for me! i brought my car in for a tire rotation and thought for sure that i needed new tires. when i asked about new tires, they took a thorough look and said i still had a decent tread. today i brought my car in for an alignment, and when i inquired about rims, despite being incredibly busy with customers and phones ringing off the hook, ben took the time to answer all of my questions and even provided me with booklets, links to check out online, and so much information! the guys here are really wonderful and do not treat you like a moron or try to take advantage of you by selling things you don't need. when i bought new tires from them, they were honest about all of the various options and prices available. they asked how long i plan to keep my car, how often i drive on the freeway, etc. to determine the best ones that suit my needs. they did not give me the option of the highest priced ones first like firestone used to do (they only gave me the highest priced ones as an option until i asked twice for other options). i have been a loyal customer for several years now and even though i live in cleveland, i still make the drive to cuyahoga falls for their outstanding customer service. thank you, leipold, you guys truly are the best!!!"
5-star,1,an honest tire store is a good find. this place has always treated us great. if you bring a flat tire in they won't tell you it needs replacing if it doesn't. really great customer service. i would recommend these guys to anyone.
5-star,1,"huge shoutout to dominic from lifetime auto works. i live in california and i was looking to purchase a 1997 sl500 from pittsburgh and so i called and dealt with him. he was super thorough on his inspection and was only $30! he took it for a test drive and took pics and also face timed me! gave him a good tip for being such a great mechanic and an overall good guy. i didn't have any work done by them but from what i saw, definitely trustworthy."
1-star,0,"i rarely ever leave super negative reviews but i'm pretty upset about this place. i will not be coming back here again. i called yesterday to make an appointment for my car to be looked at to get an estimate. i was told i would receive a call by noon.. 2pm rolled around and nothing. i call and i am told we won't be able to look at it, try calling again next week to schedule an appointment. i had to pay to take a uber there and back ! do not come here unless you want to either wait or maybe get the car looked at ."
5-star,1,"great guys. they were very fair. took a day to figure out what was wrong with my car. called the dealer to see if it was covered under warranty, researched the problem online. went above and beyond to get it right. quick work and fair pricing."
5-star,1,i work here. we are swell guys come see us ha ha. we try our best to be honest and fair. we have been here 30 or so years. basic auto repair and motorcycle inspections
1-star,0,"i called about a motorcycle inspection and was told there was no appointment necessary and that i could bring the bike in at either 9am or between 3pm and 4pm. i proceeded to show up the very next day around 3:20pm and was told that they could not do it that day. the worker told me ""i know, but we are behind on our work unless you want to leave it."" he said ""mechanic work comes first."" i told him that i will take my business elsewhere, and he replied ""that's fine."" i know it is ""fine"" for me to choose another shop, but it is not ""fine"" if he wants to run a business. it is funny that patrons do not ""come first"" and/or honoring what you say. perhaps lifetime should start doing appointments to avoid the issue in the future. it is a good thing that i was not someone who rode very far to the shop. i will not be returning and suggest you do the same."
4-star,1,"these guys are great. they are honest, quick and dont up-charge for every little thing. i have used them for over a year and keep going back because i trust i can get good service for a reasonable price."
5-star,1,"i am lucky to have met lucky. i had a radiator that developed a catastrophic leak and i could not drive this car in fear of damaging the engine. a local friend recommended lucky and told me that he is a mobile mechanic who'll come to you. i am relatively new to this area and didn't know anyone i could trust, so i took a chance and called lucky. his schedule was booked out for the week, but he made time for me. after a long day where he had been working on rebuilding an engine and then taking care of two other customers, lucky showed up at my place at around 8:00 pm and quickly diagnosed my problem. he then worked until almost 11:00 pm and fixed my car. he replaced my radiator, educated me on the finer points of my car, and was an all around awesome person to engage with. it was pleasing to see a young man who has integrity and an excellent work ethic. and he was completely reasonable in what he charged me for his services. i 100% recommend lucky from lifetime automotive if you ever need anything mechanical fixed on your car. i am sure i'll be calling him in the future for working on my other vehicles."
5-star,1,"go see lucky! best mechanic experience i've ever had. lucky is professional, intelligent, and extremely efficient. i needed an alternator replaced on my '04 tahoe and it was like watching a nascar pit crew member at work. i thought this would take hours and he did it in a matter of minutes with me standing there asking questions. not only did he make the change, but he also checked for other signs of issues (tensioner, electrical fuses, etc.). i think what stands out most about lucky is that his model is transparency. it's hard to know what you get sometimes with mechanical shops...but he prides himself on being an open book and hopes to restore people's faith in their mechanic and know exactly what they're receiving and why. he has a great vision, and i'd support his business with any of my automotive needs in the future. i strongly recommend lucky's lifetime automotive for anyone seeking an honest, highly qualified mechanic in the charlotte area."
5-star,1,"i'm so glad i found lucky on yelp! my car was becoming slow in starting and i knew it was the starter. my husband and i already had it diagnosed and knew it wasn't the alternator or battery as it was brand new. the dealership and even aaa car care center (yes i'm an aaa member) wanted to charge $600 to replace it, while other shops i reached out to wanted me to bring the car in to diagnose it although i already stated it was diagnosed already... i reached out to lucky on a saturday, he responded in less than an hour and was able to schedule my appointment for that monday. he was very honest, professional, prompt, and upfront about price/costs, which was a third of what i was being quoted by everyone else. he came to my husband's job, replaced the starter, and was all done within an hour. he's definitely in my digital rolodex and i highly recommend him. he truly saved us time and money. thank you lucky!!"
5-star,1,"great mechanic! honest, fast, fair. after i had a mechanic tell me my car ""probably needed a new transmission"" i asked lucky to have a look. he performed a diagnostic and found the car was simply low on transmission fluid. i was ready to sell the car for $1000, it's worth $7000. lucky probably saved me $6000 just being an honest guy."
5-star,1,not only was he a great mechanic but he was also honest he showed me what he was doing told me what else he thought i may need and made me feel comfortable. he was very professional he was on time he had his own tools and his prices were extremely reasonable. i would definitely recommend him and look forward to using him in the future with any other needed repairs for my vehicle.
5-star,1,"i've used lucky for a bunch of stuff on a couple different vehicles. he's honest, fast, does great work and has by far the best prices around. i highly recommend him."
5-star,1,we had a issue with overheating it was the radator fan he dident charge for the diag he fix it super fast did a great job and great prices.
1-star,0,"please read this before you go here. i am a mechanic at one of the gold mines here in nevada. i purchased 6 new tires from a friend for my f350 welding truck. i took 3 wheels off at a time to get the new tires mounted, and balanced. i called this store because they are open 24 hours a day, and got a price for just mounting, and balancing. the guy told me 25.00 dollars for each tire on the phone, i made it clear for mounting, and balancing the tire because i know the game they play once your there. i got there with 3 rims, and the tires about 8 at night. after waiting for well over an hour a guy came to me, and said what do you need. i asked him how he was doing prior to him asking me what i needed so rude right off the bat. i showed him the rims, and tires, and told him i called earlier. he spoke half english, but told me 25 dollars to mount each tire then another 30 to balance each tire. i told him nobody charges that much, and i called earlier, and they said 25 per tire. the guy waived his arms in my face, and just walked away. while i was waiting for over an hour i saw him tell 2 people that their tires could not be patched, but he can sell them a used tire. trust me please this place is only here to rip you off!!!"
4-star,1,"these guys saved my butt during my trip to vegas in december. after taking a right turn a little too tight, i ended up with a pretty bad tear in the wall of my back passenger side tire. i had to drive back to la the next morning, so my only option was to replace the tire. the security guard at tropicana actually referred me to these guys--it was 8:30pm on a friday night, and they were open (they're open 29 hours a day, 11 days a week, one of the guys would joke later on). came in, they grabbed me a good used tire, mounted it, and finished the job in less than 20 minutes. for ~$40, and with more than enough time to make it back to my hotel to change for the club, i'm definitely a satisfied customer. thanks guys! note: the tire is still on my car (too lazy to replace) but it's still good!"
5-star,1,ended up with a bad patch repair pulled in at 9pm and were helped right away!! 24 hour repairs!!! and extremely reasonable prices!
1-star,0,i have a emergency last thursday my towing droop me here and after i was willing to buy 4 tire the 2 worker they got supper unprofessional the lady on the cunner she was only to charging money this places have never a manager oh owner you can imaging you on workers hands is horrible they damaged my ring
1-star,0,"very bad customer service, i went yesterday night because i had a flat tire, they told me i have to replace it that it was no good so i asked how much for new one and it was $90 so i said i'll be back tomorrow can you put me the spare please and at the end i ask how much and they said $20 i was like why if you didn't do anything to the flat tire you just put my spare and they didn't care they were rude, i have been there like 3 times and every time is something . last time before yesterday i bought some tires and 2 of them poop on the freeway on my way to work so not only i miss work but i have to pay them for the service wtf. very bad they always trying to get money out of people ."
5-star,1,norma took such great care of me. she really treated me like her own daughter. being so far away from home she got me a great deal and her kindest was just what i needed today. thank you norma
1-star,0,"if you are looking for customer service, you could forget that!!!! i got a flat tire in the middle of the night, came here for service, and then paid with my card and was informed that my payment wouldn't go through, so i ended up paying them $120 in cash. when i reviewed my bank statement on my cell phone, the card payment had actually gone through. i returned to this place, showed them proof that the money was taken out of the bank, and the night shift worker told me that he was not the manager nor the owner so, i had to return the next day. i returned the next day, having to explain myself not to one, or two, but three employees to end up having to deal with victor, the most unprofessional one of all, aka the manager. i showed him proof of the bank account transaction as well as the receipt of the cash transaction, and because he could not find a receipt of his own, he refused to give me my money back. he then told me to call my bank. by this point, i have the bank representative on the phone, explaining to victor, that the transaction did go through, as victor kept me waiting and refusing to help. after two hours of debating with this kid, aka manager, he hands me back my $120 with no apology for all the inconvenience he had put me through. so, if you do not wish to be scammed and treated poorly, i recommend that you do not come here."
4-star,1,wow... they do what the supposed to do fix flats no going over the chemical compound or how dry they are just fix my tire black big tire places in town they want to sell you over priced price tires . but $15 .. a little to much... open 24 very good
4-star,1,"over the weekend i had been having trouble with my tire that apparently had a slow leak. looked online and found out this place was open 24 hours which was perfect for me since i had to go to work today. so i put air in my tire to make it over there safely on the street and took a drive over there. when i got there it was very well lit up so it was pretty easy to find. i pulled up and only had to wait a little bit because there wasn't anyone immediately in the front. shockingly there were a few other people there also and this was about 5am this morning. the young guy asked me how could he help me and i told him what my problem was. he asked if i wanted it plugged or patched i said whatever need to be done. he said they both are the same price and he would figure it out once he took the tire off. as he was rolling the tire to the back we saw a big screw in the tire and that was what was causing the slow leak. he took it to the back did what needed to be done and i was out of there in about 20 minutes. very great service and i am a happy customer considering the emergent situation i had this morning. you don't find many places like this open during this time but thank god i was able to stumble upon this place. they only take cash or debit card so you can't use the credit when you swipe your card. there is also an atm right there by the front just in case you have to pull some money out for any reason. highly recommend this place because they were fast, convenient, and really took care of me for a whopping low low low price. very honest and not trying to sell you anything that you don't need and get you everything that you do need. thank you llantera tropicana!!!!"
5-star,1,"really great experience. i came here a little after 10pm tonight after the donut on the car blew out unexpectedly while driving. my friend helped me put the original tire on even though it was flat, it got us the half mile to this place. they weren't busy, so we got helped right away. we got a used tire that still is in great condition. they only charged me $36, and i was out of there and home by about 10:30pm. super awesome. i will definitely go back here whenever i need to in the future. thanks so much!"
5-star,1,"the employees are always professional with excellent work ethics. $15.00 for tire repair plus the mechanic checked and put air in all tires . this place is usually super busy but today we only had to wait 10 minutes. and by the way, unlike other places they are honest here (won't try to sell you a new tire instead of fixing it!) which is why we've been a customer for years...honesty wins all the time! hannan the cashier is so nice and friendly too!"
5-star,1,"i love this wonderful and very friendly bi lingual mexican tire shop on east trop! two days ago as i was navigating my 2011 nissan hatchback with its darkened windows through a wanky narrow one lane construction zone (woo-hoo!) on a local las vegas surface street during daylight, i carelessly drifted off to the right just a little bit, resulting in suddenly running my front right tire into the hard 90 degree concrete curb at approximately 31.4159 mph (aka pi). this sure got my attention! of course it also dented my front right wheel rim in pretty badly. upon brief inspection i saw no further damage to the car. amazingly, my fairly new tire (a 2-year-old continental contiprocontact p185/65 r15 86h from tire works) maintained most of its air pressure and better yet she never went flat! all of the new tire shops i checked in with wanted as high as $590 to perform a complete repair to my poor front right pretzel wheel, which i could not drive over 40 mph without a serious shaking in my steering wheel. so i says a prayer and took my nissan here. they looked high and low and finally located one wheel left in my exact size, a 15-inch 4-nut nissan wheel which they sold to me for $30. for $21 more, they removed my tire from my pretzel wheel and installed and rebalanced it on their good used perfectly round wheel (see pi above), and then they inflated it with nitro-air bcuz i have all green stems. $51 plus a $59 alignment took care of my $590 problem. i tipped my tire installer $5."
4-star,1,"great place, got a blowout at six in the morning needed a used tire to hold me off till payday got one for $40 switch it under 30 minutes great job guys"
5-star,1,"really nice folks, helped me out in a jam with some hard to find tires late at night. next time i am in vegas, these guys would be mu first tire option."
5-star,1,"woke up at 5 in the morning on 5/16 and decided to drive to disneyland with my hubby. notice two days prior that one of the tires on our rental was slowly leaking air. did not want to risk a blowout so i went to yelp for help. that's when i came across llantera. they were located within 5 miles off the strip and open 24 hours. called for a price check and drove to their shop. we were in, nail came out, and tire patched in 30 minutes. all this for $15! filled up on gas next door and headed out. had no further issues with low tire pressure the rest of our trip. 5 stars for convenience, price, and smooth experience."
5-star,1,"fast easy cheap! signs say don't dare buy a used tire for a long trip. saw their tire choices they have a lot of used tires, i didn't need any but after reading negative reviews about them i enquired. he said your tires are new you don't need anything more than a patch. i know i said i was just asking because of bad reviews. his honesty came through immediately, you don't need a tire we will patch yours :-) he rolled his eyes about the other reviews, i am sure he is honest to everyone and never recommends used tires for long trips, people it's written on the walls don't buy used tires if traveling!"
1-star,0,"i came here with a flat tire, hoping to get it repaired but ended up out $40 and left with a just as bad tire. they explained to me the tire is shredded, which was obvious, and i was offered a new tire for $40. boy, was that a terrible idea. the tire they gave me has tire rot. how did i find this out? i took this two professional shops, and they both told me the same thing. needless to say, as desperate as i was at midnight, i wouldn't trust them to even put air in my tires. this is the shadiest tire shop i've ever been to, and i feel sorry for anyone who trusts them, as their employees were also extremely rude, unprofessional and would talk about their customers behind their back in spanish. again, don't go here unless you want to go in an even worse position than you came in."
5-star,1,needed a special tire to match a set i just got two months ago. had the tire within a day and great service. what more could i want?
5-star,1,"my tire has had a slow leak and i brought it here and they found the problem and patched it super quickly and have done a great job. i've had this issue a couple of times in the past and it's pretty interesting how when i take it to the car dealer i always need a new tire. i grew hip to the game and realized unless a nail is in a certain place which cannot be repaired, a slow leak usually is repairable. i will only go here from now on because these people are a hundred percent trust worthy and honest. i was referred by a friend who also had the same issue. mercedes benz wanted to charge her double even for a tire she got here. this is the place to go for tires."
1-star,0,"been here once to fix a flat and it was fine ..but this past experience has made me question their credibility and these f*ckers got off the hook last time my most recent visit, it was to fix a flat again (the workers work off of tips) they put air into my tires, the light in my car was gone so i was on my way. a couple weeks passed and my uncle checked my tires - i'm only supposed to have 30 to 32 max quoting the sticker on my car. the tire itself says to not go over 35 to 38. then these f*ckers put inflated my tire to 45 save yourself from these incompetent fools"
5-star,1,"this place is cheap, fast and centrally located. if you are looking for leather seats and an ac room to wait in while they work, go elsewhere. if you are looking for somewhere open 24 hours, quick and somewhere without heavy up selling go here. you'll save a bunch and will have honest people working on your tires."
5-star,1,"my son has been here twice with his 1990 subaru rs awd. each time the service is incredibly fast, super nice people and the prices are so reasonable you gotta give them a tip! don't forget to tip - these guys are living on the edge and you got a good deal so don't stiff 'em. i recommend this place to everybody i know. 90% chance they'll have your tire in stock and they will never 'upsale' you like the local tire merchants (you know who you are big name guys with all the red on your signs!)"
5-star,1,"5-stars all the way!!! my gf's brakes were metal-to-metal for who knows how long, till one day some chunk of brake parts broke off and left her stranded off highland pkwy. i had it towed to llantera, expecting a subaru with awd would be for sure, a $1,200 brake job (like you'd get at justbrakes). when we got there after the tow, the mechanics were gathered around the car, just laughing at how ""far gone"" all four rotors and calipers were - they were just shredded!!! hall-of-fame bad!!! anyway, the guy said $420.00! so i was thinking, ok, it's a subaru, it needs all 4 new rotors and calipers and whatever else broke off it, that's $1,280, about what i expected. i went to pay him, and found out it was just $420 for all four wheels, parts and labor included!!! i could not believe it!! they've since done amazing work on this and my other cars, great prices and results every time. llantera has all my car work from now on!"
5-star,1,"these guys truly truly are amazing! we had to drive from vegas back to la and as soon as we get on the road at 11:00 pm on a saturday night the tire pressure in a brand new rear tire goes to 0! i thought no one would be open and i thought we would get ripped off driving a new black s550 in desperate need of help in the middle of the night but nope! 5 minutes and a few dollars later ($10) they saved us! we had a hole in the tire that they were able to repair! they were angels! honest, fast, reliable and friendly. i highly highly recommend them!"
5-star,1,"fast-friendly-and reasonably priced. life savers, i blew a tire on my way into vegas and the valet at my hotel told me about this place. great recommendation!"
5-star,1,"so, went to vegas in my 07 highlander and half way there something on the road took my back right tire out completely. i was bummed but kept on trucking on my spare. made it safely, but in the morning saw i had a flat spare tire! panicking i began to call tire places and found that a new tire would cost 190 bucks. i randomly met a tow truck driver who recommended this lovely 24 hour place. they gave me a nice used tire and even fixed my spare for 50 bucks. best place ever. very nice people and i was able to get home safely. im going back to vegas in 2 weeks and hopefully no more popped tires, but if it happens i know where to go."
3-star,0,"maybe i shouldn't be surprised vegas has a 24-hour tire shop considering all the other craziness this town has to offer. anyways, i needed to change the front tires on my '06 bmw that i was going to trade in pretty soon, so i didn't want to spend a ton on a brand new set. used tires? works for me, and after 20 minutes, i was off driving back to la. i did dock one star because they did take (without asking) the nice tire pressure caps that were on my original tires, and when i asked them about it, they replaced them with the cheap plastic black caps. would have made it more of an issue if i was planning to keep the car (traded it to a dealer a couple days later), plus i was in a rush to drive back home. pretty certain they only take cash, and i'd use their services again if needed, just be careful if you have a nicer car."
5-star,1,"after tuesday's great service, i went back this morning to replace the other tires on my car. i would like to say it was planned (half true) but i had *another* tire go flat on me this morning, so the plan was accelerated. i was able to air it up and go straight to llantera... and i am glad i did. in and out in less than an hour, i was given two almost brand new tires and my tires were rotated and balanced. $80 out the door and i was in my office just after 9am. it's not just the price. i could have gone to any number of places and dropped $600 on 4 new tires this week and been satisfied. but therein lies the difference... i would have been nothing more than satisfied. i drive an older sports car, i mostly commute and putz around town, and never take it on road trips. i have a lead foot on the gas and brakes, so my tires do take some abuse... ok, a lot. i can admit it. that said, ""almost brand new"" tires are better than what was on the car when i bought it almost 2 years ago. the point is that llantera shows you what they have, gives you options, and makes sure you have the best tire available at an amazing price. plus the rotation, balancing? it's an added plus that everyone is friendly and helpful and thoughtful (thanks for the bottle of water!). i am more than just satisfied, i am well taken care of and happy with the experience."
5-star,1,"so it's our annual trip to las vegas and as we pull in around noon o'clock a little light on my dashboard goes on. i say ""wtf does that mean?"". well, it means that the tire pressure is low. so we put air in all the tires and it seems that the issue is fixed. several hours later, after i've grown tired of the strip we decide to head out and find something more affordable and low key. we end up at a restaurant that's open 24 hours, excellent! it's about 11 p.m. now. as i make a uturn to go into the parking lot something sounds funny, the car won't turn like it should...this just isn't right. we pull into the lot, i get out and low and behold...my rear tire is flat. this is my first flat ever. i can fix a lot of things, but for some reason i was really caught off guard by this. so we ate, i pulled out my aaa card, contemplated them. then i used the trusty yelp app on my phone and found this place. only a mile away! sweet! and 5 stars? even better. open 24 hours? sold! we make our way over to this place, pull in and they immediately help us out. they told me i shouldn't have driven on a flat tire and that we'll probably have to get it replaced...ahhhh! at this point i'm assuming they're going to try and make a quick buck on me. i'm a little stressed out and bummed that some of my fun money is going towards this, but oh well, it needed to be done. they offer me a used tire at $35 or a new one for $100. used please, just as long as it'll get us back to long beach in a couple days. they fix it up, throw on the tire and i go to pay. the gent at the register asks if i got a new tire or a used one, i tell him used and he gives me my total....$35!!! really? seriously? yes folks, that's right, these guys were super awesome and fixed my flat tire along with installing a new-ish tire to boot!"
5-star,1,"this place has saved my ass over a half dozen times while living here in vegas, not only with vehicles i owned, but in helping others i know also. wherever i have tire problems, this is somehow the easiest place to go to. and it's always the first place i can think of that is open, since crap doesn't happen to your tires unless it's 3:30am. i wanna say i drove by during a major holiday and still saw them sitting around out front waiting for business. that's awesome to me. who are these people who's tires blow out on them between 9 to 5 on weekdays? i usually refer to them as the mexicans, which is actually not racist. i have worked in restaurants most of my life, and of all the cultures that have collectively saved my ass in situations, it would be the mexicans. the way i use it is as if mexicans are the cavalry, the fleet, or whatever reliable, dependable backup slang you want to use. and i'm always sure to tip the guys when they're done fixing/ replacing the tire. they give you a good price, also. sometimes i even have a choice of getting a used tire as a replacement if i don't want a new one. for example, i had a small spare donut. i bought a damaged rim from them and a used tire, just because i wanted a full sized spare. it wasn't meant for daily driving, but was better than the dinky spare the vehicle came with. next time you're stuck, check them out! they're probably best known as the guys next to crown and anchor on trop and maryland parkway."
5-star,1,"i went there to cure an exhaust problem, which they did fabulously! another client of theirs, suggested that they do the other repairs too. i just had my front brakes done. wow is all i can say! frank really cares & i will be back."
5-star,1,"fantastic shop where the owner cares about customer satisfaction. they custom bend pipes and i needed a custom exhaust on my 1971 camaro z28 i was quoted double from other muffler shops compared to what frank the owner charged me great service, fantastic prices thanks frank"
5-star,1,"i went to majestic muffler on a late friday afternoon on recommendations from a couple of my friends. frank the owner met me and i explained to him that i had a leak in my front pipe. he informed me that he was booked for the afternoon and that i could come back first thing saturday morning. he was very polite and friendly. i went in on saturday morning and immediately noticed how clean and organized the office was. as a matter of fact the ""office"" looked like man cave. it had a large tv, a beautiful fish tank, and bamboo sofas. i was greeted by one of the friendly mechanics. i told him that frank had asked me to come back for the leaking front pipe. i was offered a coffee and sat down. after about 20 minutes frank arrived at the shop and greeted me and shortly after that took my car in. as it was a gorgeous day, i sat outside on the patio furniture and drank my coffee. within 15 minutes frank came outside and sat with me to explain the situation and price. it was very reasonable and i told him to go ahead. i continued to sit outside and frank came back out again to ask if i needed another coffee. after having my second coffee i had to use the restroom; i have to tell you how clean a well kept the bathroom is!! from the time that they took my car in to the time it was ready took about 50 minutes. the car sounds like an electric vehicle, i loved it. when i am on my bike, i am a believer of loud pipes save lives, but not my car, i want it whisper quite. i was so impressed with the service that i came back with a box of freshly made cannolies from the italian bakery a few blocks away as a gift to the shop. i highly recommend this shop!"
1-star,0,"i went there to find a cause for a propane smell coming from my 04 pacifica and ultimately fix the solution. after inspection and taking apart my manifold. they told me my upper lower intake manifold parts were ceased, ( the flap and motor). they also told me there was a vacuum leak coming from the manifold and that is the cause of the propane smell. they also warned me that my engine light will come on and stay on forever which i never had and my suv will not pass emission. they promised a replacement for my upper lower intake by swapping it from one of their buddies as dealer quoted an outrageous amount for that part. they told me they were doing me a favour by doing that and told me to wait as the mechanic guy have to drive up there to get the parts. they kept me waiting for hours and hours for three days promising me they will pick up the parts and start working on my vehicle after taking care of the other vehicles in their bay. yup, the send me home twice after causing me to wait 6+ hours a day. i left the vehicle for two night as they have taken apart the manifold. my only option was to tow the vehicle as they taken apart my parts and they were working on other vehicle. i wasnt going to do that because of the cost. on the third day they found out that their buddy manifold wasnt compatible with mine as his was from a 4.0 l pacifica engine, and mine was a 3.5 l engine. after much disappointment and frustration, especially after keeping the vehicle with them for two night and sending me home for two days after long wait frank told me they will tweak the manifold and eliminate the smell. guess what, after paying them $300 dollar the cost for repairing my manifold, the smell of propane was still there. my car ran in perfect shape before bringing it to their shop with no engine light. it still ran the same and the smell of propane was there. i dont know what i paid $300 dollars for, they havent fixed the issue. they told me the smell was a result of someone prior doing propane test on my vehicle to check for leak and it will fade with time and driving. i dont buy that at all. i been driving my suv for 4 months now and the smell hasnt went away. i will never go the shop again. they are not loyal with their promise. kept me waiting as much as 7 hours a day for three days and sending me home claiming they were busy, offered false promise. maybe because i was young and frank thought he can take advantage of that. i cant believe i paid $300 dollars for a problem that was not fixed. its all frank's fault. the mechanic was a young guy as well and he seemed knowledgeable. but even he himself was confused to the smell of propane. i will not go to that shop again. $300 dollar wasted on a repair that was not repaired. pathetic!!!"
5-star,1,"this shop is amazing and reasonable. there was a line up of cars waiting to get serviced when it first opened today, which is a saturday, and i almost gave up, but i was thankful that i waited. the doors opened promptly at 9 am, and the staff came out quickly and moved the first cars into the garage bays to get started. the staff is friendly and quick too, as they finished those cars, as quickly as they could. the coffee was fantastic, i normally don't drink coffee but the smell lured me in. i understand that they recently got a new tv setup, which is much bigger. they had free wifi too. they were very diligent on who came first. there is no line jumping and they are very adamant on that. someone pulled their car into the bay when it wasn't their turn and was promptly asked to remove their car, as there was another customer waiting. extra points for this!!! way to go guys! i was given a quote for only what needed to be done, but i asked them to do more, so that i wouldn't have to worry about my muffler ever again. the quote was still reasonable. there is no pressure. work was done, and my car is just as quiet as my wife's new car. i am one happy customer and i will definitely come back!"
1-star,0,mathews imports ... everyone please be aware!!!! if i could do less than zero i would. this is the worst place to take your car to be fixed. the mechanic has not a clue as to what he is doing. charged me over 1500.00 and my car still will not start from time to time but he calls himself a professional. gary and he why are both fake christians and liars. i will never take anything to these racist crooks again. didn't offer to refund me money but in stead charged me more money for not fixing my car
1-star,0,"quite simply, the worst mechanic that i have ever wasted a ton of money with. took my 1997 silverado in and had front brakes done as well as complete front suspension. had to have brakes replaced again less than a year later and tires, on the front, are wearing on the outer edges again, less than two years later. horrible parts or workmanship."
1-star,0,zero stars really but that is not an option. after several failed attempts at other dealers i decided to give this place a try to fix some front end noise and shaking on my toyota avalon. first time and 600 dollars later i got new brakes and rotors. left with car and still had noise and shaking. called back and gary the owner told me to return next day. then it was the drive train and bearings so 2 days and another 1100 dollars later i pick up my car. low and behold still shaking and return yet again for a 3 rd time and its another thing. now im 1700 in and almost 3 weeks dealing with this and car still not fixed. so for the 4 th time i called and at this point i just wanted some of my money back. i did not feel it was working out nor should i have to keep returning for the fourth time with the same initial problem. as i tried to explain this is when gary the owner became hostile and not responsive to my request. i don't at all see how 2 weeks 3 return trips and 1700 bucks later and you have an attitude with me? i don't recommend yes they seem nice until you have a problem beware dont fall for it
4-star,1,"this review is long overdue, my apologies to gary & staff. they first worked on my 96 infiniti i30 about 5-years ago and i have done business with them on a few other occasions when needed. each time they have been less expensive but not of lower quality and certainly more of a straight-shooting, above the table approach. i have not been dissatisfied, even when i returned with a concern of the work they had performed, they've made it right each time. i've taken three vehicles to them over the years, the '96 i30, a '97 camry, and an '06 sienna. i have been thoroughly pleased with economics (by comparison) and quality each time."
5-star,1,"i had an oil leak on my lexus that would not go away, i am always skeptical when choosing who to trust with my car. lots of horror stories out there, i just knew my lexus was going to be crazy expensive to fix and i was expecting the worst. then i found matthews imports, after i expressed my concerns to gary, the shop owner, he personally checked my car over and explained it was not as bad as i thought. they fixed the leak the same day, now i know where to take my car for anything major or small, everyone there is knowledgeable and personable. matthews imports, a real honest auto shop"
2-star,0,"when my car was down and out and i was trying to decide to fix it or junk it, i took it matthews imports for a second opinion. on the phone, it was ""sure, we'll check it out"" and that remark cost me the fee for him to hook it up to his scanner machine. dude, i knew the transmission was bad...the car tells you that. they did follow up with a couple of options that were slightly less than my normal mechanic but unfortunately, it wasn't what i wanted. still i could have gotten over it but the straw that broke the camel's back was when i got into the car, went to close the obd port and the knee pad was covered in grease. yuck! they couldn't be nicer people but not for me. sorry."
5-star,1,"i purchased a cat back exhaust system for my car and couldn't get the old exhaust off with hand tools. took my car to this meineke and they got me in quickly and installed the new exhaust system for me. they were very friendly, helpful, and i enjoyed chatting with them. highly recommend this shop and will be back for future work."
5-star,1,"the best, most honest mechanic i've ever been to. grady and all the guys are awesome! this is the only place i can bring my '96 honda accord that doesn't tell me i need $1,000+ of repairs at all times. i will never go anywhere else!"
5-star,1,i have a great experience there. no up charges. we all know how that can be. i simply got new rotors and brake service. oh! and a vehicle inspection.
5-star,1,grady is the best! always great service! convenient location to drop your car off and then head over to carolina place mall.
5-star,1,"fab front desk team, i get in and out and have a little fun in the process. perfect place for oil changes, tire rotation and the like. i recommend getting there early on a saturday morning, they will get you out quickly."
1-star,0,"nice staff, but a little shady on the repairs. i have a honda and took it in for several repairs...my main reason for going there was the check engine light was on and needed to fix it to pass inspection. i'm your typical girl, who knows nothing about cars...they gave me a list of things that 'needed repairs' and quoted me $1,500 but was way out of my budget. i took it to another place to get second opinion. i took the itemized list of things that needed to be fixed on my car and come to realize i really didn't need half of the stuff fixed they said i did. in fact one of the items they said i needed, isn't even a part of my car!! am very disapointed in how people try to take advanatage of people when they feel they can. the 2nd place i took it to was independtly owned, and saved me over $700 for the real things that needed to be fixed...thank goodness there are still some honest people around. i wouldn't recommend this place for much more than an oil change, its a shame because they are nice guys."
3-star,0,"i have to admit i would like to blame these guys for how much money i have had to spend fixing my car, but it's my stupid car's fault. they always do quick repairs, give me my options and exlain them to me in layman's terms before doing any work, and unfortunatley they recognize me and my mother now for all the work we have had to do on our cars but they are pretty nice and respectful. i can't say they try to break me any deals like the ones you may get from a non-chain location, but i am happy with the work for the most part."
5-star,1,"nice experience here. i too brought my car here based on the positive reviews on yelp. the guys that were working were all super nice and welcomed me there when i came in. best to pull your car around back (laneway) as street parking may be a bit of a pain to find if it's super busy in the area. plus you can park and enter in the back very easily. i had purchased a new used car. so expressed some concerns over it. i brought it in for an oil change. they were really nice and honest. they told me about the higher end oil they offered. spoke of the benefits. but didn't try to ""oversell"" me on it. which some garages do. they spoke like they truly cared vs trying to add on additional products and services. as a woman, i really appreciated this. i was supposed to bring my car back to costco to have my tire bolts tightened (from getting my winter tires put on) but they were able to do this for me to save me the trip and at no additional charge. i did ask them to check a few other things but i was told that they were fine. i went in there for an oil change and that's all i ended up paying for. there was one gentleman that came in while i was waiting and the mechanic was quick to give advice. they don't offer the drive clean testing there but recommended another place near by. he seemed very appreciative for this information. thanks melo auto for the great service. you definitely lived up to your yelp reviews!"
5-star,1,"i am a huge fan of melo auto. i've been coming here for 3 years now, and can't recommend chris and his team enough. they're thorough, reasonable and very friendly, and the service is pretty quick too. they store winter tyres for a fee for those of us who don't have space for them and take time to explain what needs to be done to those of us who aren't inclined towards cars. most of all, i appreciate that melo is honest and don't try to upsell me on things that i don't need. you can't go wrong this melo auto!"
5-star,1,"i agree with the last review, i didn't think it was possible to love a mechanic! melo auto did an amazing job resolving an issue that other mechanics were not able to diagnose. they had it fixed the next morning, and fully explained everything. the owner especially was great, as he seemed happy to help to resolve some other minor issues and really knows about volkswagen. i really appreciate the amazing service, and i will be back for my oil changes!"
5-star,1,was looking for a local garage in the junction. just went to melo's for the first time based on seeing all the positive reviews. they did not disappoint. switched out my winter tires for a good price. removed and repaired a nail at no charge. i will be back.
5-star,1,"best auto shop. timely, reliable and honest. as a woman i am always super critical with shops, aware of the potential for unnecessary add ons. chris and the shop was straight forward and didn't try doing more to my car than what i asked for. i'll be going to this shop for as long as i live in toronto."
5-star,1,"i happened upon this place 2 years ago when i needed some work done on my car before a long road trip. being a female who knows next to nothing about car i'm always worried about being taken advantage of, but not here. chris will always explains what was wrong and why and break down all prices so i know i'm not being ripped off. ironically chris is the old mechanic from the dealer i got my bug from 11 years ago which i didn't know until talking to him. but all in all i've always had a great experience and leave happy with the work that has been done."
5-star,1,"driving a 10-year-old vw means having to find someone reliable to fix it, and the guy i'd been depending on for the last few years moved out of town, so i went looking for a new shop. melo had all five-star reviews on yelp and seemed to know volkswagen, so i thought i would give them a shot. chris was friendly, helpful, clear in his explanations and very reasonable in his estimate. my wife and i dropped the car off and walked around the neighbourhood while our front brake rotors and rear springs were replaced, and the job took exactly as long as promised, and cost exactly what the estimate was. when i broke a front spring not long afterwards, i took the car back to melo, and in spite of a completely full schedule, they managed to squeeze the job in for me, and for a great price too. even though i live in a completely different part of town, these guys have my business for as long as i'm driving an unwarrantied car!"
5-star,1,"i came in to get repairs because my truck was long overdue and i'm taking it on a long haul to move out east to the maritimes. chris and the team at melo auto were awesome. as an auto layman finding a good mechanic is always a challenge. but chris was upfront and honest about his assessment of the state of my vehicle and explained the problems to me in a way i could understand, even going so far as to show me the problems while my truck was being examined. because of my limited budget, chris was able to work with me to prioritize the repairs that were necessary from a safety standpoint and was honest about the ones that could wait. i never felt like i was being taken advantage of. my rather extensive but necessary repairs were done promptly and on estimate. before the repairs were started chris explained to me that my break pads could be reused, but when i came to pick up the truck the next day he said he had to replace them but didn't up charge me because he doesn't like to ""tell people one thing and than call them during the repairs and say its going to cost a ton more"". amazing. he was even able to get me a great deal on winter tires. my old truck drives like new. such a shame to find an amazing mechanic right before i move out of town. if you need some work done and want it done honestly and competently, chris and the guys at melo auto should be your first and only stop."
5-star,1,"it is a great place, never felt like am ever going to be cheated or lied from the guys there. very polite and professional, neat place. i will always go there."
5-star,1,"i would give six stars if i could. absolutely amazing attitude and services. very very nice staff. they respect their customers and the vehicles. i watched chris and george putting together a motorcycle while i was waiting to park my car inside, they were so very thorough about it. they got my oil changed very quickly, and surprisingly these guys gave me a nicely done wash for free. i quote chris ""we want the cars to get out of here the way they should look like"" i mean, this is how you should do business and treat people. these guys made my day. this is definitely my go-to place from now on. thanks, chris, wojtek and george. bruce"
5-star,1,"i never knew it was possible to love a mechanic, but this is definitely the case with chris at melo automotive! my husband came here to get one of our cars fixed, and not only was it fixed quickly and with a reasonable rate, but the car looked brand new, in the engine and on the outside of the car, when we got it back. i got a safety check for another car, and it was done quickly and everything was explained to me. and, he even fit in an oil change and and an air filter change as well! talk about efficient! we will be back for our other automotive needs."
5-star,1,"i would highly recommend melo to anyone. the service was impeccable, the owners are lovely and knowledgeable, and everything was done quickly and efficiently, with specific attention paid to minimizing my inconvenience. also, they both have immense volkswagen expertise, which means my rabbit is in great hands. kudos, lads!"
5-star,1,"this shop has truly outstanding customer service. i have been to many mechanics and dealerships for auto repairs and chris and his team totally exceed all of them in terms of quality and value. i brought my 2005 civic in for a timing belt/water pump replacement and he even took the time to explain to me the work they had done and the parts they replaced. they did a number of other services out of courtesy (including washing my car, wiping the dash, checking the tires), and all was done for a very competitive price. i have a rather lengthy commute and am very picky about where i take my car: melo auto really went out of their way to make me feel confident about their work. the team here is passionate about cars and work extremely hard for their clients. this is the type of business i love to patronize and i will definitely be bringing my car here in the future!"
1-star,0,auto shop huge rip off. i wouldn't recommend. got a quote. first you need a $200 diagnostic even tho i already knew what the issue was but they still wanted to do a diagnostic. plus the part was $300 and the labor was another $200.. so this one easy part would have cost me $700+?!?!?!!! a freaking seatbelt change for $700? and you would think since it's a safety issue they would have taken care of it and let me pay for the part. anyways i went ahead and ordered the part myself online for $80. paid someone $40 to change it. $120 was all it took to keep me safe. thanks mercedes auto shop for not doing your best. lol.
5-star,1,i came in on wednesday to order a new car key and it arrived by friday afternoon which was fantastic! all of the staff was very nice and the building is sparkly and clean! maybe i'll come back here when it's time for a new benz
1-star,0,"long story short. i went first to mercedes on sahara and they give me an offer for trade in my old car and lease a new cla. after that i came to mercedes henderson to compere deals. the salesperson, who spoke with me was trent (i believe that was his name) and he did give me a better deal. after a bargain on the next day he dropped the price from $285 to $260 monthly payment. i wasn't sure do i wanna pay that price, but couple days after (today) i told him im going to get the car. sense he saw im interested he first told me ""oh, the march promotion expired, now is april and the price is $279"", so i checked the website and all of the promotions was valid till april second (today). i told him that and the next respond was ""oh, the price of $260 was for a different car"" - i told him its not true so there was a third respond as well ""oh, the value of ur car already dropped (3-4 days after), u better sale it in carmax and come here with the cash"". i told him that i don't wanna play those stupid and extremely unprofessional games. is a wanted a cheap bargain like this i would go to kia or some other lower brand."
5-star,1,"first time & nervous at first coming here to check on their certified preowned 2015 c-class 300 sedan. solex eke is my sales agent assigned to me. i felt a good vibe right away. there was no pressure to commiting to buy that evening. went the next morning, test drive the car. i fell in love with that car right away. it was beautiful inside & out! i was sold! to make this matter short, i can say i got the best experience in buying a luxury car from this dealership. i am very happy with my purchase! my first time owning a luxury car & i believe im gonna be a forever benz owner! one more thing, solex eke gave me a really good deal on this car & some added bonuses!! thank you also for michael rainone ( guest relations ), fast response & great customer service! thank you mb of henderson!"
1-star,0,"was interested in purchasing a 2018 mercedes c300. i was told by their sales person that the only ones they had were for $60,000. (sticker on these cars is around $40,000) i told them i would go to another dealer and they told me that dealer didn't have any for less than $60,000 either. everything they said was b.s. i got an offer at $43,000 for the car and was told if i came back in and decided to buy it, they could go down. when i told this by e mail to their ""sales manager"" the phone went dead."
5-star,1,"i took my car in for service here. wow! i never had a service advisor (dave) take care to accurately tell me how long it will take and give progress updates. when the service tech (james) found something that could be a hazard. dave called to explain in simple terms what was wrong and the dangers of not fixing it. i can't speak for the other advisors or techs here, but the team of dave and james gets five stars all the way. i won't take my car anywhere else."
5-star,1,"unbelievable service. you would not even understand how great this place is until you buy a car from them. bill was my salesman, and i got a good vibe and liked him from the minute i met him. i told him that i needed to think about it, and he didn't even pressure me into a same day decision in the slightest. i am in sales, so i can really admire and respect when there is another honest and integral salesperson. bill was amazing. not even just the sale; but even after purchasing the car, they have continued to provide the absolute best experience i could imagine. picking my car up from my house to help with my crazy schedule and dropping off a loaner while they were doing a clear coat for me. the car, of course, is absolutely gorgeous and is more than i could've imagined, but that's just benzos for you. if you are in the market for a car, and are big on honest sales practices and incredible customer service, check this place out! edit: gotta add in just in case anyone is wondering; the incredible service continues. will from the service department and bill in sales coordinated to come pick up my car and drop it off for a tune up. class acts those guys. i'm a huge fan of great customer service and i wish i could do more to show how much i appreciate it. if you're gonna buy a luxury product, you should always make sure you'll get luxury service and this place provides it! will even refused a tip (had no idea if it was customary to tip or not in this scenario as i've never had a dealership do this before but it is extremely convenient)"
1-star,0,got my car serviced here because they had a coupon for $50 off servicea. the customer service was meh.. my service coordinator didn't say anything they didn't really care to go over any details or whatever. overall i've had much better service at toyota. i will be going to fletcher jones mercedez next time. this place was not friendly and for being a higher end dealership the service should be a lot better. horrible!!!
5-star,1,"it's been 3 years since i bought my car from this location and figured i'd write a review since i remember how great they treated my fiancé and i. mike (the sales manager, i believe) was the one who helped us. we found our car online, scheduled the appointment and went down there and met with him. he was very patient with us and did not pressure us, he was very upfront and professional. the background story was we had just returned a lemon car sold to us from courtesy imports (i believe that was the company name) and got our money back. we would've tried to resolve it with but they were so nasty and unwilling to work with us so we got our refund and continued our search. this has been the best little car i've owned. it gets me from a-b without any issues. when the time comes for another car, we will most likely be back."
5-star,1,left my car for service and again had a great experience. this time i had eric rudd as my advisor and he did a fabulous job of getting everything done for us and getting the car back to the valet at the airport so it was there for us when we got back into town. there was a lot of communication back and forth and lots of opportunity for someone to drop the ball. with mb henderson it was flawless!
5-star,1,"if you are anywhere near the vegas area and have a mercedes sprinter camper van that needs chassis service or repair work - this is definitely the place to go. ask for jimi stevens. my customer experience here was the best i have ever had from any dealership or auto service provider. jimi understands the needs of an rv'er (e.g., do you have prime ny strip steaks in your freezer as i did? he knows to connect your shore power and keep it connected the entire time that the camper is in the shop so that you don't have to worry about transferring most things out of your refrigerator and freezer). the shop technicians immediately assessed the damage to my van and ordered the repair parts which needed to be sent from germany (and which arrived within 3 days), and the shop completed their repairs within only 4 days after they obtained a much delayed ok from my current (but not future) insurance company, progressive. progressive (avoid them rv'ers) could not dispatch an appraiser until almost 2 weeks after the incident occurred and provided me with only a $700 allowance total to pay for towing, accommodations and car rental during the almost 3 weeks i was stranded. the dealership, in contrast, very graciously helped me by providing a loaner vehicle (with unlimited mileage allowance) for the entire period so that i did not need a car rental. and - to top everything off - because the shop had to delay completion of the repairs for 1 day beyond the date they had originally told me the camper would be ready, they absorbed the cost of my insurance deductible. the henderson mercedes-benz dealership has a certified sprinter service shop, and if you have invested in a sprinter camper van, it is the only type of service to consider. i recommend this dealer highly for sprinter service/repair work, even if your van has to be towed 100 miles to get there as mine did! i'm based in austin, tx, but if i'm in this area again when i need to have routine or repair service work performed, i will definitely come to henderson."
5-star,1,we bought a new benz back in may of last year and well unfortunately we have enjoyed driving the car so much we have already put 10 thousand miles on her. so i called made the appointment for our baby to hit the service dept. had the pleasure of speaking with nick and may i say what a pleasure he was to deal with. he went over and above the line of duty and when we picked our car up it was clean an like new again. we wanted to say that because of nick we will continue to drive all the way from summerlin past the other dealership for as long as nick works there. thank you mercedes benz of henderson for having such an amazing person.
5-star,1,"in the past, i've dealt with dealerships for honda, lexus, bmw, and mercedes (across socal and norcal). through my experience, bmw had some of the worst dealerships and mercedes was without a doubt the best. this dealership is no different. after reading the comments on this page, i was a bit hesitant to bring in my glk350 for a auxiliary battery malfunction. i was originally planning on waiting until i went back to my parent's place in orange county, ca to get my car serviced, but i took a chance and gave mercedes benz of henderson a shot. i called in on 12/19 to make an appointment and was able to get an appointment on the same day with nick spesia. most bmw or mercedes dealerships that i have been to do not normally have same day appointment so that was a definite plus. i dropped my car off at 3:30pm on 12/19 for the auxiliary battery and the tier 1 maintenance. nick spesia was a great sa and helped me get everything taken care of in a timely manner. he sent me a reminder text on 12/20 to let me know the estimated time when my car would be finished. even after i got my car back and i was looking at the service summary sheet, he walked over to make sure i did not have any issues. all in all i was happy with the service i received and i am happy that everything was taken care of when they said that it would. nick did not try to push unnecessary services on me (bmw sa's love doing this). i will definitely be back for all my service need. another great plus is that they are right around the corner from my school!"
1-star,0,"i had bought my 2016 gle 450 coupe there cause at that time they gave me little better deal than on the west side. love my car but after i drove for 2 mo., there was an issue with my car when shut off the engine and put on drive or reversethere was a big clunk noise from transmission. i had been tried to get resolved from the dealership for 2 mo. no luck. so i called manufacturer they just didn't want to help saying it's a characteristic of the car. so finally someone from ny who has the same car as mine and had the same problem had reach out to me and told me that there is a new ecu software update from dealer take it in and have them do it. so i did at the west location by the way their service is much better, the problem was gone. on top of that when i ordered my car thought the steering wheel will be the same as the one i test drive which is the bottom flat. nope i was just regular. i asked salesman he has no clue then found out because i added the heated steering wheel. if i had been told i wouldn't add it. if you guys want to buy car there is would think twice."
1-star,0,"terrible customer service. called for an estimate on brake pad repairs for my glk350 which i bought from this dealership. rude, disrespectful and not the least bit helpful. this time i'm just interested in brake pads next year i'll be replacing the car but it won't be from this dealership! hello cali!"
5-star,1,"i've been coming here for years buying cars. my first was a 2014 e350 with the amg package...absolutely loved it. then this year instead of getting a lease, i traded it in and purchased a 2016 c63s amg, and absolutely love it. the quality of the car and service mercedes provides its customers are incomparable to other car companies. thank you mercedes! you have a life long customer."
5-star,1,"this review is for the sales and finance team. my experience with mercedes-benz of henderson was absolutely wonderful from start to finish! i purchased my dream car from the amazing diane casiello who went above and beyond in every way to make my deal happen! i was treated like a vip, and i appreciate the timeliness of response during my research over where i would get the best deal. i was also originally working with fletcher jones imports, however diane's commitment to me was what brought me to ultimately make my purchase at mercedes-benz of henderson. special shout out goes to mel and pete in finance who were also awesome! the dealership was stunningly beautiful and a true showcase for the fine automobiles of mercedes-benz. my car was delivered to me inside a white-tiled garage, and my product concierge steven berg was great at helping me learn all of the great technology in my car. i also love the vip program they offer - some truly amazing perks just for driving a mercedes-benz!"
1-star,0,"i went to this dealership twice to try to buy the airstream sprinter van out front.... i went ready to purchase as i have researched this vehicle extensively. the first time i went was 2/28 and apparently this dealership is closed on sundays!! haha ok never occurred to me a car dealership would be closed on a sunday. next visit was today and i couldn't get a sales person to help me. couldn't even get one to great me. i am planning on spending $150,000 on a vehicle and i can't get anyone to help me !! great job mercedes you should be proud of your employees. i will now be taking my business else where. see ya."
1-star,0,"these guys should be called the rip off kings! i've purchased 2 cars from them. my first experience was great! my second time, i had gone over on my miles, so the deciding factor for me to get another mercedes was if they would pay for my extra miles. the sales guy assured me they would cover it. 2 months later, i have mercedes benz financial calling, telling me i owe for extra miles. i call the sales guy back, he assures me again, it must be a mistake and he'll get it taken care of. now almost two years later i go to co-sign on a car for my boyfriend and the dealer comes back to me and told me i can't because i have 2 leases at mercedes under my name. when i called mb financial they told me one is my lease and the other was extra miles. so for the past 2 years, that has been on my credit, fucking it up. i cant co-sign for my boyfriend. i have left messages with a few different people and no one is calling me back. way to go mercedes! way to fuck over your customers. next time i'll go to bmw!"
5-star,1,"went there to have an extra key made for my benz. customer service at the front counter was professional, polite and helpful."
1-star,0,"why am i not surprised this dealer is associated with fletcher jones? i have dealt with their horrendous location in fremont and henderson location has proven to be just as bad. they had my car for a week with no status update...i had to call everyday to see if they even had my car because of the lack of communication. when the service department called to let me know the vehicle was finally ready for pick up, i asked if the car would be washed and they said yes. picked up the car and it had not been washed after asking 2 people if it would be. then, a road test had claimed to have been done but they could not provide the mileage prior to and after this supposedly completed road test. and why do the service technicians need to touch the audio system and unhook parts that have nothing to do with the needed repairs! after 2 horrible experiences with 2 different fletcher jones locations, i will not even go near the newport beach location. they only know how to push sales but their service department lacks in service. what's the point in purchasing a mercedes if you can't even get the maintenance and repairs needed?"
1-star,0,"bought a gsk 350 from this dealer back in march. after driving it for a few months, i realized it was to small. went by the dealership today to get a free car wash, and look for a replacement. after pulling into the service lane, i got no service/attention. went inside saw nothing but service employees bs'ing. went to the cashier and asked for help, and a young man walking by said he could. we went back outside to get a car wash tag, and i asked how long it would take, and i was floored when told it would take an hour. by this time i was totally disgusted with their customer service and left. i'll buy a larger suv, but it won't be from this dealership. this place has no hustle."
5-star,1,the service is above and beyond what you would expect. thanks butch and gary for walking us through the process of getting us our 2015 mb. just viewed the car a few minutes ago and they did a incredible job of detailing the car to get us ready to go we are very happy with the incredible job that mercedes-benz of henderson is done for us.
1-star,0,"worst experience. called in to have my battery replaced. quoted 307 plus tax over the phone. dropped my car off. then i get a call that it was going to be $400 with tax. when i told them i was going to bring it else where they told me i was going to be charge me a diagnostic fee of $150. after taking to the service manager, i got it waived after he was trying to justify the fee. then they told me my car couldnt be jumped. i told then no worries i will have it towed i have aaa. then they tried to match the quote. pass aggravation. lost a customer for life. the service adviser did all he could but customer experience out the window. headed to sears and save me $140 bucks. my wife wanted to have her benz serviced here, not anymore.. we will take our cars to another dealership. they need to attend a class on customer service... no wow experience at all. i can spend my money anywhere.."
5-star,1,i really like the great service & attention to detail every time i take my mercedes in. my service consultant doug murray is awesome & always makes my service appointments fast & perfect.
1-star,0,"i bought my car online from this dealer then have it ship to california. the whole experience is a disaster. the car arrived dirty inside and outside, dupont paint care paid for but did not applied, mileage on car does not match dmv paperwork. deal closed on june 27 but did not receive car till july 10 night time. car got trucked from nv to ca on a 10 car transport truck with no protection over the car. car has funny sound from bottom ever since delivery then finally found out in less than 60 days that bottom of car was torn/damaged. called dealer and sales person to try to resolve but the answer is sorry, its too long nothing we can do. so all i can say is, be careful when dealing with this dealer. accusing me for damaging the car and come back to dealer to seek compensation is not a way to service your customer. in particular the damage mark as shown on the photo clearly showed that it was caused by transporting. all i can say my experience with this dealer is unbelievably bad. i guess from now on, i will need to crawl under the car to inspect the car before taking delivery."
1-star,0,"pretty horrible place. we owned a mb in the past and took our vehicle here for service. on one occasion, my wife drove our almost disabled car in for repairs. the lot attendant then tells her to get in the passenger side of her car and he proceeds to drive her to the rental facility for a loaner. upon arrival, there are several courtesy vans from other dealers dropping off their customers. so if i buy a hyundai i get a courtesy van, and if i drive a benz i get shuttled in my broken car. today i went into the dealer to look at the new cla. i parked in front and there was a salesman standing there. no acknowledgement whatsoever from him. i proceeded into the showroom and again, no one approached me. i really would like to buy another mb, but customer service is very important to me and i refused to drive to west las vegas for service......so i guess i will not be doing business here. i've owned several higher end vehicles so i can make a reasonable opinion......henderson bmw, not too bad at all........infiniti....best service i've had.....henderson mb......horrible."
1-star,0,"the worst experience i've ever had. i don't even want to get into it, but just know that the employees don't care about their customers... and don't expect any follow up calls. they are so unorganized and careless. the dealerships in los angeles are much better but i had no choice but to go to the henderson location."
1-star,0,"service department: lack of communication and follow thru from service department ...and... watch your bill for 'miscellaneous' parts charges. you can request, but will not receive, a line item breakdown of these charges because they charge you a percentage of your bill as 'miscellaneous parts'. this is in addition to parts outlined and charged against specific repairs. i understand that this percentage can be as much as 8% and in my case, my bill was increased by $50. this is just wrong and i'm not sure how they get away with it. it's better to seek out a mechanic who specializes in mb repairs instead of being blatantly ripped off at this dealership."
5-star,1,"at last, the final chapter in our car-buying saga (at least for now): after being disrespected at fletcher jones on sahara, we drove straight to merecedes-benz of henderson. i know they are owned by the same parent company, but our experience in henderson was the exact opposite of our experience at the ""sister"" store. maybe stepsister is more appropriate! we were greeted with a smile by sandy, and she took care of us promptly with her chicago charm. soon, we were talking about deep dish pizza, not arguing about the chassis of different models or being asked, ""what can i do to make this happen today?"" most importantly, she took us seriously. there was no haggling or the usual song and dance that is often part of the car-buying process. we let her know that we needed time to decide if this was the car for us, and she had no problem with that. when we decided it was, we called her up. we arrived at the dealership shortly before closing time on a saturday evening, and the entire process was fast and pain free. the finance manager we worked with was as nice and easy-going as sandy. this says a great deal given that we were there at closing time on a saturday! i realize that a lot of the car buying process has to do with the individual you end up working with. so, sandy is definitely the lady. however, based on my experience at mb of henderson, i get the feeling that the new car sales team is pretty nice to work with as a whole. i would buy another car from them in a heartbeat--if i had the dough! for now, i am thrilled with the one new car in my garage."
5-star,1,"i used to have a 2001 kawasaki kz 1000 i bought with 49k miles from a police auction. the cops removed all their cop equipment, and sold it. when they did, they just ripped stuff out of the fairing. i also had no maintenance records. i had someone recommend dave. dave completely fixed the wiring mess in the fairing, and did the maintenance, adjusting. carbs,valves, chain, everything. bike ran great. i kept it, and traded it on a 2007 harley ultra. dave changed the horns, and put the ipod module in the bike. i couldnt be happier with dave and i recommend him."
5-star,1,"dave adjusted the valves on my zx10r, not only did he do a great job, he fixed an oil leak that is common on the 2005. couldn't be happier, never had a problem and have recommended him to friends who he has also taken great care of."
1-star,0,"seems like dave is very selective in the jobs he takes, and doesn't seem knowledgeable if you have something major to get done go elsewhere. after telling him the symptoms and what i thought was wrong he couldn't even give me a educated guess what he thought was wrong, if you're a mechanic and someone tells you symptoms of a problem he should be able to at least have a general idea what's wrong and he didn't. he just told me it would cost thousands just find out and just told me to buy a new bike. great, a moron could have told me that. i wouldn't even take a scooter to him that only needed air in the tire. maybe he's getting too big?"
1-star,0,"dave is not a good mechanic at all. took my honda 4 months ago for a carb cleaning. after picking the bike up, notice that the bike wasn't starting with the choke on. he told me that was normal! long story short, did a mediocre job and had to take it to another shop to get fix right."
5-star,1,ok...here's my story....i left my suzuki katana 06 just sitting for roughly 1.5 years and did nothing with it. well that was stupid. when i finally did go to ride it it was running really rough...real jerky and basically unrideable. i looked on craigslist to see if i could find a motorcycle mechanic that would work on my bike because the shops around town charge ridiculous prices. i found metricwerks and dave. after a few text messages decided to trust dave with my bike. i had it towed to his place and within a few days he called back and let me know it was finished. i picked it up and it ran great. from my understanding the carbs were dirty and needed to be cleaned. he did it and it has run great ever since. he did the work in march 2013 i am posting this now in october 2013. i wanted to wait before posting a positive review just in case the work he did didn't last but it has so he deserves a positive review and i am glad to be the first to review his place on yelp. dave did an excellent job fixing my bike for a very fair price and i recommend using him as your alternative to the motorcycle shops in town. stan.
5-star,1,"i went to midas today for a second opinion on my ac after my dealership wanted to replace the compressor. i like this shop since the staff are up front, and i was not disappointed. the gentleman who helped me thought it might help to charge the ac, but when he realized it was working ok today he just suggested i come back another time, if it stops working and did not take advantage of me by charging the ac, and charging me the 170$.00. the shop performed a couple other repairs..i needed, and their prices for filters are much better than honda."
3-star,0,work was good. purchased new tires and a front end alignment. had to go to my local dodge dealer to have the tires re-balanced as midas didn't use the correct weights.
5-star,1,"i arrived at this midas location this morning and am having the breaks fixed on my 2012 jeep liberty, they got the truck right in earlier then scheduled. mark who is doing the work recommended that all of the breaks be replaced saying that even though the back breaks are ok they would need to replaced within the next 30 to 60 days depending on how much driving i do. i explained to him about my job and that i drive 7 days a week. he suggested that all of the breaks be replaced. while the cost is a little more then what i expected i feel that it is worth the cost. i know the truck will be safe to drive in the end."
5-star,1,unfortunately i ended up working with someone else for my own reasons but these guys were awesome. they really rolled out the red carpet and i recommend them.
5-star,1,"i trust both my vehicles with this midas location. they have never tried to push any unnecessary service on me and they have always done a great job with whatever i need done, from tires, brakes to oil changes. and they are always helpful with any problem or question. i highly recommend them."
5-star,1,terry was extremely helpful and considerate. he made sure our vehicle was safe to continue our journey and managed to find time to treat us kindly despite being very busy. we would very highly recommend coming here!
5-star,1,"been awhile since i did an updated reviews. currently sitting in the waiting room. didn't see the name of the man that checked me in, he's great. very nice and entered me to see if i could get my oil change free today, unfortunately i didn't win :( as usual they get my vehicle in quickly (with appointment) have never had any problems here, have never been told any bs, this needs fixed, you need to add that to do this etc, just straight forward service and honesty, that and there wonderful customer service is what has had me coming back to this place only for oil changes for a couple years."
5-star,1,"i took my car in with the expectations of having to get my rotors replaced and possibly brake pads replaced as well. when i originally went in on a saturday morning, they asked me to come back around 2pm, which was fine because i still got in same day. after they took a look at my car, turns out there was something very minor needed for the brakes and everything else looked fine. so unlike most maintenance shops, midas was very honest with charging me for what i actually needed done. they were also very good at explaining the details to someone who knows nothing about cars and very patient! this midas definitely gets 5 stars and i will return for any future repairs."
5-star,1,"i always leave this midas feeling good about my trip there (even if it results in me spending more money than i'd like). my partner and i have been coming here for years and the staff here is very knowledgeable, personable, and respectful. they're always happy to explain what they're doing and what they think the car needs - and they're really good at simplifying things without being the least bit condescending if you're not a car person. my partner has never felt that she was treated differently because of her gender which, sadly, is not always the case at other shops. i always come away feeling that they've done their best to do what's right for me and for the car and never feel pushed to do repairs i didn't want to do. if they find additional work that might be needed, they explain why and how urgent it is and then let you decide. they're also happy to share their experience and advice. i also really appreciate that they track the history of your car and use that to help guide their recommendations. in summary, this is an honest and fair shop with a great staff."
1-star,0,"the guy who runs the shop is a snake. i literally heard him talking about ripping people off in the garage. he's got a bad pitch he throws at everyone that comes in, ""what are your intentions with this vehicle?"", like it's going to blow up at any moment if you don't get 3k of work done on it right then. he threw a bunch of ridiculous numbers at me, because a needed work done right in that moment. don't go here."
2-star,0,"similar to that tire review, i did my very first oil change at midas, after receiving my car, i went straight to chicago, and then the oil indicator turned on while i were still on i-57. after pulling off, i found my oil life was only 15% and called the store personnel, who asserted that they did change the oil and suggested me to do another check-up after my trip. well, that how the first experience became the last."
5-star,1,"i love this place!! one of the most consistent autocare experiences i have ever had!! i had some serious concercns that needed attention immediately! the car was purchased in july of 2015 and is an escape. my car went through a dealership ""inspection"" and another mechanical ""inspection"" by yet a third party; and not a single problem was found, besides a lie from the dealership that the ""oil filter housing unit"" was leaking. i returned from a trip out of town to see my mother for the holidays (december 2015) and we heard a loud ""pop"", and thought we had hit an animal, but i wanted the car checked out anyways. upon returning home, i took the car to midas, where pat and derek had my car on the lift and explained that the bushing had popped and that i would likely need transmission work done. i was not pleased with the expensive report, but it was so wonderful to have them physically show me what was wrong with my car and where. my car was taken to get a new transmission and additional front end work done. once that was done, i brought my car back for a second time to have the oil changed and the ""oil filter housing unit"" inspected. again, i was treated epiclly and shown that there was no leak and that my car was in good working order from what they could inspect; as nothing is set in stone when you are talking about a very complex machine that we have created. the power steering fluid was flushed and filled. and yet another issue was adressed in a manner that was flat out honest!! i really appreciate these guys because they run such a professional, upstanding, and efficient mechanical facility! i will be returning for all my mechanical needs, and you should too because they will do right by their customers!!"
5-star,1,"a+ for customer service! these guys are some of the most honest and reliable mechanics i've met. i had my front brakes done today and was very pleased with the service. they are open to price matching local competitors, which i very much appreciated. highly recommend!"
1-star,0,"this is an establishment i will not even enter again. i was laughed at, spoken to with condescension, and treated very poorly. i will not go back."
5-star,1,"5 star service. wouldn't go anywhere else. come to think about it, i don't go anywhere else. i don't need to go anywhere else. thank you midas on moreland. thank you."
5-star,1,"wonderful service. i took my car there three times for little stuff. they never charged me only gave me advice, on how to fix it myself. so when when my car did need major work, i knew they would do it right. i have been bringing my van back for over three years now, with no regrets."
5-star,1,"the staff is courteous and know what they are doing. i always have oil change here and they make inspection on other parts quite thoroughly. the good thing i like about them is they never push me to have my car fixed, so they just print out a detailed quotation for me to think about. the only one thing i would love them to add in the oil change package is vacuuming. whenever i need vacuuming, i have to go somewhere else and i don't like it!"
5-star,1,"incredible service! brought a quote that car-x had given me on work that i needed for my car and midas did the same work for over $100 less! derrick, who i assume to be the manager is an example is customer service. friendly in interaction, clear and succinct in explaining any work, and helpful in suggesting alternatives. overall a great shop and one that i'll be returning to in the future!"
5-star,1,"i had what ended up being a super bizarre and drawn out saga of car trouble. however, the moral of the story is that these guys were great is keeping me in the loop with what was happening (with a problem that was in no way their fault) and really reasonable in how much they charged for the amount of time they spent diagnosing the problem and fixing it. i would definitely take my car back if it starts acting up!"
5-star,1,"i cannot recommend this place highly enough! in the past three years, midas has provided reliable and personalized service for my seemingly problem-prone car. for a car-challenged person like myself, i have probably most appreciated their honesty and genuine concern for customers. derek, patrick, and the entire team have offered recommendations without any pressure to make a decision, and have actually declined service when my car didn't need it. they seem to remember their regular customers by name (and car haha) and are all incredibly friendly to everyone. not to mention that on several occasions, i have checked around and found them to be one of the most affordable and reasonable autoshops price-wise. recently, i had an unfortunate personal situation where i could not pick up my car for close to two weeks, and the team at midas drove my car into the bay each night before i finally managed to pick it up. this kind of personalized care really makes them stand out, and definitely add to the community and neighborly feeling in champaign."
2-star,0,"i've been there 3 times. yes, they are friendly but overpriced. the first time my car needed new brakes. the second time i went there because my left front tire was making weird noise. they claimed they can't hear anything. i came back 3 month later because the noise got louder and i was not the only one who could hear it. i told them to check the wheel bearing. the older guy made a stupid comment that woman hear things. needless to say that i never went back. i got the bearing fixed at meineke (highly recommended) in urbana."
5-star,1,"these guys were amazing! they were friendly and courteous, found the problem quickly, had the part in stock, fixed it for the quoted price, in less than the quoted time. when a sudden thunderstorm stranded me in target on foot while my car was being fixed they even called me to ask if i would like someone to drive over and pick me up in the rain (i did, and they did!) i will definitely be going back the next time my car need some care!"
1-star,0,"avoid this repair shop completely. if you are expecting a shop that takes care of your vehicle while in their care, do yourself a favor and go elsewhere. while having routine maintenance completed, the technicians damaged my vehicle. not only did they not tell me about it (which i would have been upset about, but realized it was an accident), but the manager wasn't even surprised it happened when i pointed it out- it was very obvious. they did admit fault and in full disclosure paid for the actual repair (after i called multiple times) but know that midas doesn't put their customer first when being considerate of their customer's time, effort, frustration or that they may not even tell you about it in the first place. you make your own decision, but it's very disappointing to me that i can't trust this business to do right by the customer. good luck."
5-star,1,fantastic service at midas for brake repair and maintenance. i have been a customer of midas for years and they have done excellent work on my cars. i had an old car and other garages wanted to charge me a bundle and midas examined the car and prioritized the repairs to most essential with respect to my budget. i appreciate the professionalism and the service. they give fair pricing. when you buy brakes the cost covers labor and parts and you will only pay for future parts not the labor.
5-star,1,"i am so pleased with the honesty of this crew. i came in with suspicions of an oil leak; no physical evidence, just something my dealership told me and it was going to cost nearly $800. i came to midas for a quote. the mechanic literally walked me under my car to show/explain there were no signs of any leak. i know he could've easily made a sale and i am wholeheartedly grateful for his honesty. i will return to midas for every fix i need!"
5-star,1,"rodney and the entire service department at midas treated me very well after nearly being taken to the cleaners at the last place i took my car, and explained that i didn't actually need anything, and didn't charge me even though they had my car on a lift and taking everything down to have a look at my brakes. not to mention the quote for the service was 1.5x less than the last quote i got for rear pads/rear rotors. they single-handedly have gained my business with this one transaction. couldn't be more thankful!"
5-star,1,"needed an oil change after driving through 4 states and these guys were busy, but still managed to have my car ready for me within the time they said they would be done. the mechanic also suggested a few things that had to be done which was the same suggestions my other mechanic from florida advised me on. i am definitely coming back."
5-star,1,"seven or eight years ago i needed an oil change. i got to a shop nearby 20 min before closing. i waited at the counter for 5 minutes. no one even said hello, and i left. by the time i got to midas they were about to close. they didn't care--they helped me anyway. i've gone back since for everything from oil changes, state inspections, routine maintenance, major service, new tires, and a/c repair. i get the same thing every time--honesty, quality, and a fair price. plus a chance to grab breakfast or lunch at the dive-n around the corner. what's not to love?!"
5-star,1,"i had a great experience here. i rolled in in my cross over suv sounding like a dragster. i wasn't sure if i had a hole somewhere throughout the exhaust or if i needed to replace the entire assembly from the car back. the technician checked things out and quoted me for both options and here comes the great part. he was honest with me and recommended that i go for the option that was roughly $800 less expensive and that not only would it do the job well it would actually outlast the more expensive option. needless to say they've just acquired a loyal customer in me. when you find a mechanic with integrity that you can trust, you don't take your car anywhere else! and so i quietly drove away a happy customer feeling $800 richer with a nice quiet ride."
1-star,0,this midas location is grossly overpriced! i am new to the area and thought i could trust the midas name so i went to this location because it was so close to where i was staying. i needed wheel cylinders on the rear wheels of my 2001 hyundai accent. i was unhappy about the price but was uncertain of my options and didn't want to mess around with faulty brakes because i have a two year old. i did some research later and found out the midas four miles down the road charges $100 less for the exact same service. the midas in pineville here is a total rip-off!
4-star,1,"good place to wash your car. it's a bit small, expensive, not a huge fan of having to use their tokens, but the vacuums are amazing!"
5-star,1,"my first time there and i am really happy with the excellent service i recommend you to go there, you can make your car hand wash ( take an appointment before ) or you can wash it yourself is an indoor heated self-service"
5-star,1,this place is top notch. a nice warm place to vacuum your car and wash it out in the winter. great suction on the vacuums lol much better than the gas station vacuums.. i was just in there today with my brand new car and believe it or not i had never hand washed a car before. the young kid in there was so helpful and even let me borrow his shammy.
1-star,0,"i will never return here! car wash is fantastic but the staff/owner is extremely rude. i just attended to get a car wash here. after washing my car i was immediately approached and asked to leave the bay as they had a line up. there was 1 car and 3 other people who had finished long before me and had been drying and detailing their cars. after being asked to leave the bay i asked why he asked me and not one of the 3 people drying their cars and his response was ""because you can do whatever you need elsewhere"". i told him i would never return he said good. i paid 18 dollars to hand wash my own car and this is how they treat their customers. this was my first time here, i never spoke with this gentleman prior to this and will never return!!"
5-star,1,"indoor do-it-your-self car wash with vacuum & clean washroom, friendly staff, i go there every week to wash my pick up, very crowded on weekends."
5-star,1,"very helpful teller and the location wasn't busy when i stopped in! they do have a drive thru atm, yay! located right in front of the dmv."
5-star,1,"member since 1984 and still very pleased. was able to apply for car loan with phone while traveling, then swing by this branch to accept paperwork. rates always competitive as well."
5-star,1,"great service, best banking experience ever!!! i highly recommend navy federal to anyone that appreciates fast in and outs, and polite and courteous service.."
1-star,0,"why the hell does it take 5 business days for a cash deposit into an atm to reach your available funds? it's cash, holy shit."
5-star,1,i've been with bofa for nearly 10yrs. check/sav/cc. they also provide my fico score updated monthly. 750. i own my home outright. car paid for but getting old. i make a respectable salary that's directly deposited into checking acct. like clockwork for years. applied for a car loan. denied. asked to have my cc limit raised (a whole $400 bucks) so i keep my utilization down. denied. i randomly walk into an nfcu after bofa treating me like a clean cut transient and boom! was your father in the military? yes! please deposit $5 to become a member and open up a savings. ok. you'd like an auto loan.? yes. interest rate is 3.79% and you can borrow up to 24k. i opened a checking acct too and will be transferring my business to nfcu. and not electronically. bofa charges $3bucks unless you do bill pay and wait 5 biz days while your $ floats in the air.
1-star,0,"absolutely miserable experience. to start my experience, i walk in to sign a check on a new loan. the lady at the front said she would be able to do it so we didn't have to wait. well, she lied. waiting for her for 30 minutes, we walked up to her and politely asked what was taking so long. she said we now had to see a personal banker. she just didn't care to mention that or care that we may have things to do in our lives. she said we had one person in front of us, so we waited another 45 minutes while the bankers helped 3 other people and others helped no one. the lady at the front was deceitful. i will never step foot in this branch for any reason. by far the worst run bank i have been in."
5-star,1,"great credit union! i like that they specialize in assisting military personnel & their families with banking needs. the people who work here are very helpful, knowledgeable & friendly."
1-star,0,"we came in at 130 they close at 2 on saturday. we were told 13 people were ahead of us. there was only five, and a couple of them looked like they were together. we were told the wait time was going to be two hours. she was panicked and looked like she wanted to get the hell out of there, but we decided to try and wait. it couldn't possible take two hours to process the people that were waiting. apparently she was right. they only had one guy working with people, even though there was four tellers, and he was so slow. this guy spent 35 minutes on a couple. when we left he was still dealing with them. this beach needs to better prepare for the weekend and have more staff or cross train the tellers."
5-star,1,"like all navy federals, this one treats you with respect. never had a bad experience and do lots of business with them. i'm not sure what that one commenter below said about fees etc. i've never paid any fees at all with navy federal as they have the fewest fees and most free things out of any bank/credit union out there. free checking, savings, atm... best rates on other financial products... so definitely don't want to misinform out there. it doesn't get much better than navy federal as far as handling your day to day money goes. what makes me come back every time are the great people that work there and that are always willing to help fix a problem and make things right if there is any confusion."
5-star,1,gosh i love this bank. today i stopped in to get approved for a vehicle loan and kirsty took care of me. extremely knowledgable and friendly. she explained everything in detail and covered all my options. when i left i had a check in hand and a handwritten cheat sheet she made for me while i shop for a vehicle. so refreshing dealing with a bank with your best interest in mind that looks out for you. thank you navy federal & kirsty :)
1-star,0,i wanna first off by saying that when you first show interest in joining navy federal they show you the up most respect then once your a member fees and chargers just keep coming and really dont help you talk to one supivisor who was rude and when i told him i was changing banks he laughed if your thinking of coming to navy federal please save your time money and respect this is by far a joke of a credit union and financial company and these people are here to help us service members lol nfcu your a joke!!!!!!!!!!!!!! beware they just want your money..
1-star,0,"abruptly changed drive through hours without notice; then, held funds on atm check deposit without any sort of warning or pop- up notification that funds would be held for two days. two business days from an evening deposit before a weekend equates to five days in the real world. customer service refused to help release the funds. nfcu is become as large and bureaucratic as any other large bank, with lower quality service from corporate than you could even expect from a giant like chase."
1-star,0,"very disappointed with navy federal. my wife and i found the perfect house in the perfect neighborhood. the only problem was we had a short sale a little over 2 years ago so getting a loan would be difficult without 20% down. we were told to check in with navy federal because they may be able to help us. my wife called and was told they have a program with 100% financing and no pmi, even if we had a short sale. my wife made it clear that the short sale was only 2 years old but they said a short sale doesn't matter. when she told me about it, i was excited, but thought she must have heard wrong because it sounded too good to be true. we called back a different day and spoke to a different person who said the same thing. i personally heard it this time, so i got really excited. we went into this branch and spoke with someone in person about it. again we were told that they have a program with 100% financing and no pmi even though we had a short sale 2 years ago. the only thing we needed to do now was get pre-approved so we could see how much we qualified for and at what rate. a few days later, i get a call from navy federal about the application saying that since we had a short sale, we couldn't do anything without at least 10% down. i was shocked because we had been told by 3 different people before that we could. i told this lady on the phone that she needed to tell the rest of the credit union this so they stop telling people that this type of loan is available with a short sale on your record. she said she'd like to but can't. we were not the first people this has happened to. just so very disappointed with navy federal. now we will miss out on buying the perfect house in the perfect neighborhood. thanks for getting our hopes hopes up then crushing them."
5-star,1,"i couldn't be happier with the great service i received today. i purchased a low mileage lincoln from a non-lincoln dealership last year. i got a recall notice and decided to look for a lincoln dealership near me, so i picked nick mayer from a list. i arrived for my appointment and was assigned to sandy, a service advisor. she made me feel at home right from the start:) i needed some additional maintainance, so she worked it right in with my repair. a short time later it was all done and my car was waiting for me, spotless! everyone i met was friendly, helpful, and i'm so happy i found them. i'll continue going to nick mayer for my service and i'm passing on the good word!"
5-star,1,have been going here for about 7 years now. relaxed and clean showroom. the snacks and drinks are great. free car washes and the concierge are a big plus. gave a very fair offer for a trade in. very straightforward with their sales process and clearly show how they arrived at their numbers. will continue to go back.
5-star,1,"dealership is wonderful! courteous, friendly and quick. the showroom is beautiful and the waiting room offers beverages, pastries, tv and wifi while you wait. bought two cars and will continue to get all my vehicles from nick."
5-star,1,"-extremely fast service -everyone is nice and makes sure you're being helped -the parts desk guys are awesome -the waiting room chairs are incredibly comfortable and the coffee is good -unlike other dealerships i've gone to in the past, my car does not leave with grease marks all over my leather seats and steering wheel."
5-star,1,"we had a great experience at nick mayer. we were looking for luxury midsize suv and were undecided between all the major makers. our sales guy paul prenatt showed us the various lincoln models, explained all the features and answered all our questions. this was at least a month before we purchased. we then went on to test drive all the other brands over the next month. paul and jim stayed in touch throughout the process but weren't at all overbearing. we finally came back to lincoln for addl test drives and they were always accommodating. we finally decided and got a good deal together. delivery of the mkx was flawless. i love the room where they take the car and go through it with you. everything was first class."
5-star,1,"i had a very positive experience at this dealer with the corporate sponsored lincoln date night promotion. i had an extended test drive of a lincoln mkz for a weekend including dinner at a restaurant. it was a unique experience, and the process between lincoln client on facebook and the sales consultant paul prenatt whom i worked with at the dealer was seamless. lincoln and this dealer have sold me on the brand's great commitment to client service and satisfaction. you don't get this kind of attention from other luxury auto makers. i'm very impressed with the remodel of nick mayer lincoln too - it's very classy, modern, and fresh. if i decide to purchase a lincoln, i will definitely return to this dealer and work with paul since he was knowledgable, respectful, and not at all pushy. i can't fairly judge their sales process or service department yet, but i would predict they have a nice level of professionalism based on my experience with them thus far."
5-star,1,i had a very pleasant experience with staff/ and management they were very helpful to my needs and the car looked better then when i brought it in this purchase was probably the easiest transaction i have ever had and their closing with finance was a breeze great job thanks nick and chad
1-star,0,i ordered a brand new luxury car and have been treated like i bought a crappy car from a sketchy used car dealership (not that its ever ok) ! they have no problems just lying to you and telling you what ever you want to hear just to get you to go away ! their communication has been severely lacking (seems to be a common theme if you read the other post)
1-star,0,"hell no stay away from these thiefs -scam artists -slumdealer nick mayer please read...... i traded 01 jeep wrangler sport, and $2050.00 cashiers check and 1800$ cash at nick mayer in exchange for 07 cadillac escalade, which was on sale for 27,000.00. they gave me 7,000 for the jeep so 10,850.00 down payment. i had the cadillac for a total of 3 months. in which time i had gone to the dealership, as well as called to see what the hold up was with the plates which i was expecting in the mail. i was given temporary plates to assure me that it was just a slow process. then when the plates ran out again i requested to speak to the finance company. i was then notified that there wasn't any loan pending or otherwise... i immediately asked for my jeep, and wanted to just move on. well, it took a week and a half, . once they called me in to pick up my jeep, i saw there were 4 damaged tires, which were changed from the tires that were on when i gave the jeep as a trade. there was 4k miles extra, and there was no longer a soft top, (as i had included both a hard and soft top in the trade). the reasons for the condition of the jeep and excess mileage were because nick mayer had sold my vehicle before financing was finished. so they basically sold my jeep while they didn't own it. this ordeal began in july of 2012, and i finally got my plates from the dealership on friday feb 15, 2013. thanks to maria in the title department of nick mayer. proving that nick mayer did indeed have my file they claim to have destroyed, even though liz the assitant control manager says they're seperate and have nothing to do with my file. i have the conversations with maria and the assistant controller on audio as their phone gives notice of the call being recorded, i also recorded the calls to ensure that the story would stop changing depending on who was on the phone., once we all figured out the problem, the general manager todd greenberg asked if i could wait one week, because the car was in some lot downtown and it would be a little while till they got it back to phoenix. i complied. so after a week, they told me to come on down we'll trade cars, they'll refund my deposit, and we all go along our separate ways. well, once i got there they refused to sign or allow me to sign as to what date i brought the cadillac, what the miles were, or even the basic condition they received it in. so i called police department, to have some evidence of at least what day i brought it back and if there was any noticeable damage, which the officer saw none of the sort. they refused to give me temporary registration, to even get home with... and told me that the title would be my problem to get back on my own.no refund shocker this jeep was my only form of transportation, including getting my kids to school. i had spoken to just about everyone at that place trying desperately to get some help. then i'm put off with promises to look into it, to refund my money, there employee turn arund is so high none of the staff that was working during this time even works there anymore. buyer beware nick mayer is a shady outfit even in other states where he does buisness the attourney genrals office lists of complaints is quite long in every state he operates in . save your hard earned money and go to a respectable dealership that wont rip you off!!!"
1-star,0,"we bought a mercury there a few years ago and decided to use it for service covered under our ford extended warranty. big mistake. boy have they gone downhill. service is extremely slow and terrible communication - it's taken over a week for a simple repair. at conrad's, it took a day for the same repair on a different car. on top of that, you get dinged for a $100 diagnosis charge per problem (twice conrad's charge) and anything not covered by warranty gets outrageous labor charges ($100/unit) and inflated parts charges. if you have a lincoln and money is no object, maybe this place is ok. but if you made the mistake of buying a ford, and a ford warranty, go elsewhere (and of course live and learn and don't buy one again)."
5-star,1,"i am quite surprised by the negative responses here; however, my experience was fantastic. if you are looking for a vehicle and want an honest up front sales person please go and talk to clayton who is the sales manager as he is awesome. as far a financing sinny was great. i bought an f150 truck and they took many hours to get me set up optimally. since i leased my vehicle i have discussed my lease with some friends and coworkers and they cant believe what they did for me. i have had a very positive experience and would recommend them strongly to anyone looking for a vehicle. thanks clayton & sinny you guys are the best!!!!"
1-star,0,"had my breaks examined by these morons and after they were done they only tightened the lug nuts by hand and let me drive off the lot. well a week later one lug nut fell off and all the other ones were lose on all 4 tires. can you believe that? no checking, double checking or caring for that matter. worst place ever! 0 star is what this place deserves for their awful service."
1-star,0,"too bad i cant give them zero stars because that's what they deserve. they lied to me about options that i could and couldn't get in my truck. i believed what they told me and gave them a deposit. a soon learned they had been dishonest with me and nothing they told me was true. when i asked for my deposit back they told me it was non refundable so my options are either to buy a truck that they lied about, or lose $1000 and go buy from a reputable dealership. their terrible reviews on here speak volumes. go anywhere else and you'll be happier."
5-star,1,"buying a car is always stressful, jason, michael, and sib made it a pleasant, even fun experience. northstar ford has always treated my family well. in fort mcmurray, and calgary is no different. thanks guys, i love my focus."
1-star,0,the worst place i have ever went to. they promise that your 1000 dollar deposit is refundable then tell you it is required. both of these things are a lie. the salesman lied to my wife then called her a liar. very very unprofessional and would never recommend this place to anyone.....don't even make this place your last resort.
5-star,1,"i'm aware that almost every other review here suggests that they're atrocious in one way or another. i figured i'd share my experience as well, since it has been different. i bought my 2013 escape here in january '13. the sales guy i dealt with, who is no longer there, was well-informed, friendly, and didn't push me anywhere i didn't want to go. i knew precisely what i intended to buy and he competently assisted me with that. since then, i take my vehicle in regularly since i bought the pre-paid maintenance package. i have (almost always) been very happy with their service department. the guy i dealt with most every time is no longer there, but the new one i met just today seems helpful and earnest. i've been happy with north star, and will continue to return there for my maintenance even though it's about as out-of-the-way from my home and work as it can get. but they've done good by me and earned my trust."
1-star,0,"my most recent problem as of october 2014 if i could give them 0 stars i would. stay away from their finance plan/option called flex pay. 1 year and 2 days after 1 drove away with my vehicle my payment jumped $140 for the next 3 years. this is not something offered through ford credit canada. it is only something offered via northstar. feel free to private message me for full details. there is not enough characters in a yelp review to explain it all. went there tuesday september 24, 2014 to turn my keys over for my suv that was towed there the day before. was the victim of a horrific hit and run on the sunday night. i knew my car was written off so i spoke to chris sando and decided on a 2011 explorer with 30 000 km on it. told him i was sold turns out it was sold sometime between last tuesday the 24th and friday the 27th. he called me on monday the 30th to tell me it was gone. when i asked how it was sold when i said i would take it, (i was waiting for the write off $) i was told i never put a deposit down. i was never asked for one and i was in constant contact with him daily, including friday after the explorer was sold. he didn't take kindly to me pointing out his neglect and he said ""i'm in the business of selling cars not holding them."" that's when i hung up the phone. some how got suckered into a purchase by manager(s) apologising for chris 's behaviour and being in no state of mind to have bought the car as i was still dealing with my injuries from being ripped from my car by the firemen and being heavily medicated. i was taken advantage of."
1-star,0,had my truck there 3 times to get fixed and even told them what was wrong with it. they told me it was something else and that ford would not let them fix it. it was so bad that i got ford of canada involved and took it somewhere else and they fix the problem i was telling them about.
1-star,0,"a couple of years ago, i was shopping for a brand new car. the service at north star was pathetic. they wasted my time and were so disorganized. i have viewed, visited and considered bmw, toyota and hyundai at crowfoot and the experiences do not compare. what is wrong with them. first thing was, i was shopping for a compact car and they tried to sway me into a suv that they had excess of. second the car that i was supposed to test drive was actually located at the dealership in cochrane. even though test drive was all prearranged, it took them over an hour to get it to crowfoot for a test drive. seriously, over an hour. lastly, they were not interested in bargaining. even though it was the end of the selling season, they were standing firm on the list price, minus $100. you are wasting your time with these fools. i implore you, try somewhere else."
1-star,0,"stay away! they took advantage and tricked me, straight up. mislead me to thinking my deposit would be returned to me and would be used only to ""hold"" the car i was interested in. when i went to collect it the next day after choosing not to buy the vehicle (it had been in an accident and i felt it was too great a risk) they refused to give me my money back. then i read more reviews and realize they are inconsistent with deposits. shady!! will never buy from here!!"
1-star,0,"i leased a car, dave was are sales guy . he told us that we can add kms later on if we needed them, as i live in cochrane and work in the ne of calgary . we knew we were going to go way over the kms . called today to add them and was told that was not an option. now we will be stuck with a minimum of 3500$ extra in kms. they lie to you to make their sale . and in the beginning they didn't let us know who to pay as they set up the financing. i called atleast 20 times and no one called me back . i finally got in touch with the gm and he found out for me. i very much caution about this dealership . the ratings are justified . and for the love of god stay away from the used side . the sales guy followed me from the used side to the new side and told me ""i thought you were buying a vehicle from me"""
1-star,0,"they are a rip off. northstar will upsell you on repairs that do not need to be performed and those that do need fixing won't be fixed, you will be back in a week fixing the same thing, whereby they will tell you something else needs to be fixed. i don't recommend northstar under any circumstances."
5-star,1,"i was, at one time very angry with this dealership. i was never going to return, but it occurred to me that 3 years after my grievance, there may be new staff and management. i went to end the lease i had and purchase a vehicle. at the end i mentioned my past grievance, and they were receptive to making it right. i've changed my 1 star review to a 5 star based on the what seems a new and improved team. !!"
5-star,1,"o'reilly has a customer for life for their awesome service. rewind to 10/22/16. car won't start leaving work. call for a jump. due to time of night, only o'reilly is open. not wanting to wait a day to get the car battery replaced, i arrive just before closing time at their rainbow location. one of their employees (wish i remembered his name) helped me to swap the dead battery together with a new one i just purchased there. fast forward to today, i had been out all night with a friend for his last night visiting vegas. car start-up sounded weak when i headed out that night, so i figured ill get it checked on way home. heading home at 6am...just my luck, car won't start. now im really, really tired. i end up waiting just over 1hr for a jump. head to superior tire on rainbow since they open at 7am. asked them to check alternator, battery etc to make sure its the battery. they show me the tests & yup, it is. get battery replaced and im up & running again. i know i kept the receipt so ill grab it back home. tired as i was, i needed some sleep before heading back out to take care of this. wake up around 2pm. find out superior did not leave me the old battery, my fault for being tired & not double checking. no big deal i thought, ill go right back and get it. stopped by the same rainbow o'reilly location on the way(right down the street from each other) to verify the warranty dealio. 3yr warranty, battery is 19mo old. all good if i bring back the dead battery. i get to superior, turns out the battery already been scrapped. they get pickup weekly and guy happened to come by in the 7-8hr window since i been there. im thinking, 'i. am. f---ed. with a capital f! just lost out on a $140+ refund. still, i head back to o'reilly to see if something can be done. even if its a partial refund, store credit, anything. after explaining to the employees whats happened so far, it seems like im sol without the actual battery. one employee says, let me see if i can get someone to help you more. by chance, their district manager, craig happens to be in-store. he does his thing and to my amazement, gets me a full refund! are you kidding me?!? just wow!! im relieved as sh--! we even talked horse racing, vegas golden knights & their historic trip to the stanley cup finals. 2 out of 2, above & beyond experiences at o'reillys. the rainbow location, in particular! craig & his team deserve praise for the great service they provided myself. id give more than 5 stars if i could. im so impressed. customer service is key for any business and o'reilly definitely delivered."
1-star,0,"for the second time now i've purchased brakes here and gotten the wrong parts as a result. so great that i had to waste everyone's time on two separate occasions driving and walking back to the store to return for the right part while my car was being worked on. how hard is it to read the numbers off the computer and to walk in the back and get that part come on. not to be left out the rude unprofessional ""employees"" socializing when i walk in, give me no greeting then barely answering my questions. i will not be returning again."
5-star,1,"i just wanted to thank ray, for helping me fill the fluids in my car, and for all the information he shared. so nice how they will come outside with you to help! i know very little about cars and maintenance etc, and have a fear of me destroying my engine by opening the hood, so i appreciate the help, lol!!! great customer service and great selection of products. thank you! (next time i'll have a mcdonalds breakfast sandwich for you.)"
5-star,1,i needed a new battery and ray who helped us was a pro at everything. he didn't want us to buy a new battery if we didn't have to. he tested our battery and right away it came up bad. he let us know why we needed a new battery. even showed us the ticket that printed out. my car works fine. thanks ray for all your help keep up the good work!!
5-star,1,"came in for some help changing my lightbulbs...i have no experience whatsoever with cars, but i do now! crystal and devan were so awesome and helpful, devan took his time to help me understand how to do it and fixed the lights for me, super appreciative of the new knowledge and his patience and willingness to help. much much better then autozone, thank you crystal and devan."
5-star,1,"great service! just went in for an oil filter and to dump some oil. the guy at the counter (don't recall his name but wore a camouflage hat) hooked me up with a 10 percent firefighter discount and thanked me for my work. the same gentleman met me out back and help me unloaded my oil catch, emptied it for me and put it back in the trash bags i had it in. phenomenal service, a true rarity in this day and age. thanks"
5-star,1,"frank was able to help me immensely with garage opener & car alarm battery, autozone just straight up turned me away, frank thank you so much for all your help & finding me the right equipment! much appreciated!"
5-star,1,i came in with my husbands car after his battery died. i was quickly greeted by caesar who began to immediately deal with the issue. all three of the staff members in the store were friendly and jovial. he had a new battery in the vehicle and i was on my way in 15 minutes. the quick service was greatly appreciated.
1-star,0,"there is nothing more frustrating than having enough knowledge to look up your own part to avoid mistakes on someone else's behalf there, using the part vendor's own system due to working in automotive...then calling the vendor's store, in this case o'reilly auto on rainbow and windmill, and being told that they have the part # you want, and they will hold it on will-call for you....and.....you arrive at the store to purchase said part and the store manager tells you it is a non-stock part, they've never had it, and when the person who spoke with you on the phone pipes up that he took the call the store manager lied and said he was talking about something else....even though the other parts counter person then tried to help me and did indeed take my call, and told me the part that now doesn't exist was in the store over the phone. i guess i should be used to this type of thing, since i manage an auto shop, but i was very impressed with this store's ability to disappoint."
1-star,0,"i am never coming here again. rude workers who weren't very helpful and did not even greet me. they only greeted old men. maybe because i am a young guy they have no respect for or maybe because i wasn't white. the workers were saying inappropriate things and being so unprofessional. where was the manager? after my purchase the lady worker did not even say ""have a great day"" i had to tell her that and she just walked away. horrible customer service. thank god autozone opened near by."
5-star,1,anytime i need a part for my car they are very quick to help and explain exactly what to do. last time a gal helped me put on some new wipers and just the other day i came in looking to add oil to my car and eduardo quickly put on his gloves and showed me exactly how to add the oil and check.
5-star,1,"had to get a new battery for a jeep. the battery is difficult b/c it's under the seat. some competitors didn't want to change it. matt was willing to help. in fact it wasn't an easy job, but he got it out and put the new one in. he went out of his way to help me out. this is the stuff that will make you want to return to that specific store."
2-star,0,very unprofessional staff. all of them were messing around and not really focusing on helping us. no customer service at all.
5-star,1,"aaron went out of his way to be helpful. i originally called them to see if they do oil changes (they don't) but instead of ending the conversation there, he proceeded to let me know the prices of the different oil/filter deals that they have. he also gave several suggestions on places that are open now (8pm) that could change my oil now. thanks a million aaron!"
5-star,1,"needed a cv shaft. didn't have it in store but had it transferred the next morning. staff was friendly, helpful and professional. core charge return was painless."
5-star,1,"strongly-constructed, this auto parts store is more than a third backroom parts and has more than ample parking. stocks the standard consumables like fix-a-flat, car batteries, and nitrile-coated gloves, as well as fuses, bulbs, oil, anti-freeze etc. a good addition to this neighborhood. located near choice sinclair in the same pad as the new church's fried chicken, across the street from smith's off rainbow between robindale and windmill on the west side of the street."
5-star,1,"it is time to get the bike ready for summer, so i popped in here to make that possible. i am still glad that checker (or what used to be checker),is still here. they are better than auto zone. the staff here is very knowledgeable about cars and motorcycles too. the clerk was also a mechanic so without my husband this was challenging, but your staff made it easier for me. there is nothing more or irritating than having the wrong part. the clerk ensured me that would not be an issue. i had to get oil, new plugs no wires, antifreeze, and a few other odds and end; but i got all the goods to make my motorcycle run strong through the enduring heat that will be here for a stent. all the support that i have gotten from the mechanics and staff here they are so awesome and ready to assist with all things that are mechanical."
1-star,0,"so many fraudulent 5 star reviews its not even funny. this o'reilly's is run by children. a bunch of stoner kids who can't couldn't find a box if it was in front of them. i've called and asked if a part was in stock they said ""yes come on down"". when i arrived they said it was a special order part. why on earth did you say come down??? today was an entirely different issue. went to pick up a item that was clearly labeled by the only female employee there who is fantastic by the way that it was clearly for my company. the male employee kept asking the year make and model and went and said he couldn't find the item. clearly the middle shelf marked ""pick up"" was not clear enough. either way thank you to the female employee who found my order. as far as the other teens and twenty somethings need come training in customer service."
5-star,1,my check engine light came on a couple of weeks ago. i went to two autozones and they could not read it. came here and they did. i always thought that o'reilly's had more experienced people working there in general. i still do!
4-star,1,"they always seem to have what we need when we go in, so i like that. the store is clean, and they remain polite, long past the point i think they should just lose it. they don't have as many fun things as pep boys, i mean, i don't fix my car, but i can wax poetic about the minion air fresheners in banana scented. lol they keep track of what is bought, if you have the little card thingy, so if you don't have a receipt it isn't the end of the world. big parking lot, lots of handicapped spaces, and brightly lit stores. the lack of a star is because some staff seem on a perpetual grump, like they are one customer away from losing it, but that customer has never been me, or when i'm in the store. :d"
5-star,1,"saturday march 21st 2015 10:34 pm. marcus was very helpful. we need 5 qt oil castrol gtx, rags, & oil filter for routine oil change. he smiled too!"
5-star,1,"sorry steve, but i'm a fan of this store. the dude that assisted me was very knowledgeable, and i'm glad he looked up the right part for my car. i sure don't want to waste my time and energy looking up something that won't fit my baby. i had my oil changed recently, and when the nissan service center quoted me an additional $150 to change my air filter, and to get a coolant flush. i said heck no! i'd rather look up youtube videos, learn it and save myself some money. when i told the guy my story, he said yeah you could find everything on youtube, and do it yourself. my total bill came up to $25 something dollars, and it took me 30 seconds to change the air filter. not only did i save some money, i learned something new. thanks, youtube!"
5-star,1,"these guys are awesome. they work their butts off, and go the extra mile when needed. we had such a tough time getting my battery replaced but they made sure the job was finished. i will definitely be coming back for all of my auto needs!"
5-star,1,sam helped us out and i'm very thankful for him. that's great customer service! they should have more people like him in this world. very helpful kind and just went the extra mile for us just because he felt it in his heart to. awesome employee. thank you sam.
1-star,0,"went in to buy a replacement headlight bulb. i knew the exact part # from my owner's manual, and grabbed exactly what i needed. while i was checking out, the cashier asked me if i wanted him to check and make sure it was the right item. i asked him not to, but he checked anyways and told me i had the wrong item, and grabbed me a different one. it turns out i did have the right item originally. when i went to return the bulb, the cashier told me that the original cashier was correct and i didn't know what i was doing. when i showed her the burned out bulb, she made some excuse about the headlights having multiple bulbs. she also gave me a hard time when i wouldn't give her my phone number to get my refund. poor service, poor knowledge, poor attitude, i will not be back"
1-star,0,"poor customer service. waited in line with 5 other customers, while 5 employees didn't even acknowledge one single customer. one of them was the store manager. his name was ruben. this place is a joke."
1-star,0,the service and knowledge of the staff is so poor i moved my shop's commercial account to a different location. constant screw ups. and if you go in the counter person will invariably have no idea what you need and will have to ask an absent coworker for help. even when i call with their part number they can't get it right. pathetic.
2-star,0,the dumbasses sold me the wrong size intake hose because they didn't have the right size in stock. i bought a fancy hydraulic jack there and while it was great for awhile the thing broke shortly afterwards.
5-star,1,--the staff was very helpful; the cashier even carried my purchase out to my car (it was really heavy). --the store was clean and didn't smell like an auto shop. --they had a wide selection of items. --i was able to purchase diesel exhaust fluid for just slightly more than at a big box store.
5-star,1,great customer service! thank you don for taking time out to change out my back light bulb for me! couldn't have done it myself. thank you!
5-star,1,"gotta say that i love o'reilly auto parts in centennial hills! i always go there first if i can because there are usually lots of women working there. today i didn't see any women but...oscar the assistant manager helped me on the phone and in the store. they never make me feel stupid. they don't sigh when i walk in or help every man in the store before they finally have to help me. (happens every single time at auto zone on rainbow. every single time! ) thanks o'reilly auto parts! in addition to the items i needed today, i gotta say that i am thoroughly impressed with the jet black turtle wax i bought months ago! show room finish!"
3-star,0,the service you would expect from any auto parts retailer. the staff here are knowledgeable and will try and help you through whatever issue you may be having with your car or truck. much of the time i utilize the staff for their experience from working on cars to help me determine what might be the issue with my cars and weather or not i might be able to fix it on my own. they also have a code reader that you can borrow while in the parking lot to help diagnose an issue that might be communicated to your vehicles computer.
5-star,1,very friendly staffed always in buying parts but today made me want to come back again and again there were only two people working it looked like all day and both times i came in it was busy and the young man with the beard was friendly talked to the customers gave advise laughed and got through the line while saying sorry for the wait with no problem will recommend this o'reillys to everyone
5-star,1,"i have to say a true lifesaver philcron was! i was in a business trip, 4 hours from home and noticed my car started smoking very badly. i pulled in to here and within a few minutes they found the source of my problem, a pinhole leak in my oil filter that i had changed at walmart. it was spraying oil all over my engine and pipes and my oil plug was stripped out! they quickly changed my oil and filter and re tapped my drain plug and wiped all the oil off my engine and pipes. very honest and i would go here again!"
5-star,1,philcron auto services is amazing. i was so pleased with my experience here after a rough few days with a broken down car and a poor experience at the dealership (where i originally towed my car to get fixed). sherry was so pleasant to speak to and accommodating of my schedule and situation. i haven't had a mechanic in the 4 years i've been in charlotte and it is so hard to find someone trustworthy. i know i can trust the people at philcron and will be coming here from now on. thanks so much! highly recommend!
5-star,1,wonderful auto shop! i love this honest family owned business i will not take my vehicles anywhere else for service! been coming for 3 years and never had a bad experience. they are totally fine with you bringing your own parts as well.
1-star,0,terrible. will not diagnose a car. car went in with vibration issues and left with the same vibration issues. will never be taking our car here again.
5-star,1,i seem to leave more negative yelp reviews so to be balanced wanted to give some love to my very favorite vendor - philcron -. i have been taking my cars to these guys for several years and the service has always been top shelf. most importantly i trust what they tell me. i have never felt like it was a change parts until you fix it approach. they don't mind you asking questions and explaining why they selected the repair method.
5-star,1,first time in charlotte and was in need of a quick oil change. i tried a precision tune auto care closer to my house and they said they said they couldn't take me 45 minutes before closing. so i decided to drive an extra 20 minutes to this precision tune auto care they took me in last minute and they were closing up for the day. hospitality was great and i felt like my car was in good hands. will return !
5-star,1,"had to get an inspection today so i could get plates on my ""new"" used car and they helped me out. they ran into a snag with my title stuff and the lady at the counter along with the mechanic did everything they could to resolve the issue as quickly as possible. when things don't go perfectly that is when you see their true colors. thanks so much!!"
4-star,1,"i had on oil change & brake flush done on my pt cruiser, price was reasonable and the staff/manager was friendly when i came in the precision tune and leaving with my car ready for the road. will back again for my next oil change."
5-star,1,"i like that i can call, and almost always get in the same day! i also appreciate the thorough checks they provide with estimates of what ir would cost for anything they find wrong! this is very helpful in financially planning my maintenance!"
1-star,0,"dishonest practices! i went here yesterday and they did not pass my car over ridiculous things. they said the light to my license plate was out so my car wouldn't pass & also that they needed to do much more work on my car in order for it to pass. i sensed that they were lying in order to charge me more and run up the bill. i decided to take my car to another garage to see if i was correct. i was! the garage i went to today passed my car with no issues at all and found no ""problems"" for which to ( over ) charge me. also i was warned by a business owner in the neighborhood where this precision tune is located not to go here as i was waiting for my car in his place of business he informed me that they had messed up work on his car when he took it to them & he no longer goes here. don't go here dishonest practices!!!! trust your instincts!"
2-star,0,"this is my second time here. the first time i came on a nice day so they were busy (expected) and i chose them soley because they were open on sunday. i just needed a basic oil change, waited 2 hours, but it was done so no complaints. they gave me a loyalty card (buy 4 oil changes, get the 5th free) so i came back. this time when entered i waited over 5 minutes at the counter to be greeted, then was almost turned away because the wait was so long (over an hour at least). the guy at the counter wasnt pleasant, didnt thank me for coming back or patiently waiting. then the next person who came in (a guy) was treated much nicer. maybe because i was just paying for a ""bare bones oil change"" (his words) i didnt require customer service. they do not take appts. not recommending."
5-star,1,"reliable, honest, friendly and professional is how we describe priority car care. (we were long time customers of christo). new owner ken does a great job also. today is a good example: my car wouldn't start. i called ken, who sent 2 mechanics to my house to look at it! they brought it to the shop, fixed it, then picked me up to get my car. what service! this is beyond excellence. then in dec. 2017, a local toyota dealership said i needed new struts and gave a written price quote of $1246.37. that's a lot of $. i decided to get a 2nd opinion at priority. ken showed me the struts and said they are fine & do not need to be replaced. wow. my family and i are now loyal customers of priority. i recommend them to everyone."
5-star,1,these are the only people i trust with my car. the price and quality of the workmanship is the best and they do it in a timely manner.
5-star,1,ken kept me updated on the status of my car service. he explained what they did in a manner that i understood. service was done in a timely manner. i felt comfortable waiting in the waiting room's shop as they worked on my vehicle. i would recommended ken's company to family and friends.
5-star,1,"as a result of my last experience and review in september, christo's elected to take the high road with the appropriate response. and i must say its refreshing to see the business culture coming back to the tried and test results of ""honest customer service."" after being compensated for the results of my last experience i can see christo's succeeding by taking the right direction in this tough and apprehensive economy."
5-star,1,"new owners were wonderful to stand by the previous owner (christo) service parts and repairs to my old jeep. when i showed my receipts for parts still under warranty, they honored them and replaced the faulty parts. even drove me home when an unexpected emergency situation had me pulling in to the garage at closing time. nice people and very service oriented. i'll be taking my car back to them again for future work."
5-star,1,"very fair service, it is nice to find a guy that wants to help and fix what is wrong for a good price and not upsell you. i have used another guy in the past but these guys are much closer to my house. i can reccomend this place."
5-star,1,this is the only shop i go to in mesa when i want a truly honest and cost effective solution to any automotive issue. this is truly one of the best shops i have ever worked with. the owner is one of the kindest professionals i have ever had the pleasure to work with. what i value is his advice on whether a problem is worth fixing or not. he doesn't just take your cash and run. he stands behind his work as well. i love this shop!
5-star,1,"the guys at jiffy lube down the street recommended this guy to me. i'm glad they did, because he was great. my work truck (05 tacoma) was shaking whenever i accelerated, and after taking it for a quick spin, diagnosed it as a bad u-joint. he said i should drive it any more, but couldn't fit me in that day (he seemed pretty busy). when i told him i had to drive it for work, christo said he would fit me in, because he really didn't think i should be driving it. a few hours and $198 later, he had both u-joints replaced and my truck was back to normal again. i am definitely planning on using christo's auto again because of his great work, his genuine concern for his customers, and his very reasonable prices."
5-star,1,rick is the best! we've been comming to him for eleven years now. have referred several friends as well. he has the best craftsman ship there is. and excellent pricing. we take our cars every two years to get a spruce up. he fixes all nicks and marks inside car! gets ride of noises too... i can't recommend him enough...
1-star,0,"if only you can give a zero star rating... the location for this shop has changed, but no need to wonder where because no one should ever come here for their car needs. i was recommended to this place by my uncle. the owner, rick, was friendly and all but he was most definitely not consistent. i dropped off my car and he estimated a 3 day wait for my car. it took two weeks. he even asked if i needed the car for anything important and i responded that i had my first day of college coming up. unfortunately, my car wasn't ready by that time. every time i tried to call rick, he would give me little to no explanation as to how my car was doing. when the day came to pick up my car, he called and said it'll be ready to pick up in just an hour because they were cleaning up my car. the back of my car was an off-color, but just on one side. the right taillight bulb was burnt out. my car was not clean at all! the outside was still dirty, there were leaves all over the floors, someone left newspapers in the backseat along with empty water bottles and little purple socks that seemed to belong to a little girl. to top it all off, my aux cord was stolen! i have a lifetime warranty here but never will i come back!"
1-star,0,"if not putting any stars is an option i would have done that. do not go to this place! they will keep your car too long for unreasonable excuses and make promises they can't keep. when you get it back it is not worth the wait. poor customer service, poor car repair, total rip off..."
5-star,1,"as good as you could ask for. i was in an accident and was sent to pro customs through the other drivers' insurance company. from day one they tried to be up front with the time and status of the vehicle. due to issues beyond either of our control the last eight days ""i need one more day"" was said almost every day. on the eighth day there was an issue that would of cost us all time, money & aggravation. i asked them to meet me half way so we both could be happy and done with the job...they did. because of their work & service i will use them personally and recommend them to friends."
5-star,1,"i think this is the first ever review i've written on yelp but the service i got from this place was so great i wanted to spread the word. i had two fender bender issues to sort out and i didn't want to go via insurance. their initial quote was good but when they knew i'd be paying myself, they reduced it considerably. the work was done on time and was stellar. they even repainted all the small scratches on the front bumper that i'd not asked about and they cleaned the car inside and out. fantastic place."
1-star,0,"predatory towing! lately ive been seeing tow trucks cruising thru my condo complex not knowing why until tonight i witnessed a quick tow truck, stop and was ready to steal my neighbors car. i ran outside to ask what he was doing and who dispatched him and he refused to answer me. i ran and got my neighbor. i kept asking him for proof of being dispatched and he refused. what he was doing was illegal. he promptly ran away."
5-star,1,it helped me when i was down in the road at night. my car broke down and i contact them and within 10 mins they found me and helped me for a reasonable price i really recommend them
1-star,0,this company should get employees that are loyal and not thiefs they took a attached rear view mirror i had in my dodge nitro that is not right and told the woman who is the receptionist said they take pictures thinks i'm stupid they know how to open cars they took and then took the picture like really how stupid was that they get so much dam money and can't afford to buy a dam mirror... that really sucks how much fake people are out here in las vegas!!!
5-star,1,great professional service via phone or email. provided factual information to make good decisions. responds in a timely manner and gets the job done. they're my go too guys for any towing needs!!!!
5-star,1,it is never an enjoyable experience to have your car towed. i have had my fair share of car towings goodness but i've never found a company that after i've dealt with them didn't leave a sour taste in my mouth. quick towing on the other hand answered my call soon gave me a time frame and showed up within half an hour. i mentioned the yelp deal on the call and the distance which was from outskirts to summerlin to north las vegas. my driver juan gave me the yelp price and was friendly and fun! my keys weren't required. despite arriving at the wrong address first they arrived quickly and gave me a great price! they took my debit card over the phone and i enjoyed the experience! i hope i don't need to tow again soon but if i do i'll use this company again for sure !
1-star,0,"don't count on them to show up on time or communicate with you. i was told 1 hour...two hours later, i called them (no, they didn't call me) to find out what was going on. i was told, ""another hour"" for the tow. a 3 hour wait at the side of a highway? and no phonecall to let me know? sorry, i find that unacceptable. i called another company. i would rather give my money to a place that follows through and cares about customer service."
5-star,1,"it feels kind of weird yelping about a towing operation, but i had the unfortunate need last night. friday night, 9 pm, parking lot on the strip, car won't start. i'm thinking ""damn, it's time to get gouged by a tow truck, and have the pleasure of waiting forever. i did a quick search on my phone, quick tow actually had some pretty good reviews and it looked like their home address wasn't toooo far away. i call, they said it would be about an hour, bummer. they also said it would be $75 for the hook up and $5 a mile after that. a few minutes later i get a call from the driver saying he'll be there in 10 minutes. boom, from the time i make my 1st call to truck arrival, less than 30 min. driver friendly, helpful, all around cool. as we leave the parking lot, i set my odometer ( i had a working car there too) to see if i'm going to get forked on the mileage. we went 3.1 miles. i'm thinking they would say since it's over 3 miles we have to charge an additional 5 bucks. nope! total charge on a friday night in freaking las vegas was $90 dollars. it sucks having to have your car towed, but these guys were on their game. professional, quick (just like their name says, crazy, huh?) friendly, fair, and no bs. it really helped my mood to have such service, highly recommended."
5-star,1,best auto shop in town. wade is the friendliest and most knowledge salesmen i have ever met. will only ever buy from that guy.
5-star,1,"as a recent customer, i can say with total confidence that if you're in the market for a high-quality used electric car (ev), red rock auto is the preeminent best choice in the greater phoenix metro area. wade & mike deliver a delightful boutique experience by quickly and simply doing the right thing. they maintain an excellent selection of first-class cars, at a good range of prices, and they work diligently to ensure that the entire purchase process is painless, straightforward, transparent--and notably unpressured. great people."
5-star,1,"wade and mike were awesome!!! went to look at the nissan leaf after driving the bmw i3. wade suggested reading consumer reviews before buying bmw. after that, bought the kia soul. very happy with it."
5-star,1,"terrific, hassle-free experience! my wife and i stopped by to check out a miata that i'd seen on cars.com. it was priced much lower than other similar listings, so i figured it was too good to be true. but, what the heck...we had the day off. sales manager vernon was extremely knowledgeable and helpful. he showed us the miata along with a few other vehicles i had a question about. the lot specializes in barely-used nissan leafs, but have enough of a variety of other vehicles to keep it interesting. one thing led to another and after a lengthy test drive (was having so much fun i lost track of time), i now own my dream car! their inventory is immaculate, there was no sales pressure and the financing process was the easiest i've ever experienced. thanks vernon and team for helping me cross ""own a miata"" off of my bucket list!"
5-star,1,"wow. these guys are awesome. so i'm in the market for a nissan leaf. i went to another dealer and found a good price on the internet. but when i got there they told me it was an extra $1000 unless i financed it. so i was a little wary of the car buying process... when i showed up here, i wasn't sure what to expect. what i found was very impressive: - no pressure - super knowledgeable people (wade and mike) - they knew everything about every individual car and about the models in general - they were patient and explained everything - it was my first time buying an ev - great prices - quality inventory. they only had leafs with 12 bars. highly recommend these guys and would easily buy again. they do business the right way."
5-star,1,"red rock automotive is a fantastic dealership to purchase a used vehicle! i went to 7 dealerships and test drove 10 vehicles, it was an exhausting process. once i finally discovered red rock i never looked back. wade made the car buying experience very relaxing and actually enjoyable. he was also able to meet my budget for the car i was looking at. i would recommend red rock to anyone looking to purchase a vehicle. they provide excellent service, without the tress and pressure you get from most bigger dealerships. i couldn't be happier with my new car :)!! thanks, wade !!"
5-star,1,"mike is a game changer. i had been to 2 dealerships already and called countless others and was hell-bent on buying a car that day. i knew exactly what i wanted and this dealership has a lot full of quality, hardly used, electric cars to choose from. he cut me a deal and also gave me other breaks for having a+ credit even though it was the first time i've financed a car. he is honest and cared about his customers, it shows through in the ways he explains everything and works hard to pull through. he knows so much about electric cars and made the whole process celebratory and not scary. the only thing different i can ask for was to come here first instead of going to bigger dealerships who are interested in selling me cars i don't want! he also delivered the car to me for my convenience! you just can't get any better then this red rock auto!"
1-star,0,"used car buyers, beware red rock automotive!! not sure where to start, but this place is totally unprofessional!! i just had the worst experience ever with red rock, specifically wade and mike. i live out of state but was strongly considering buying a car from red rock auto after seeing one online i liked. i'm a serious cash buyer and wanted to proceed further. so, after a week of on going, online negotiations with wade, i decided to take it to the final step. i told him as a smart consumer i would of course never be able to buy a used car or talk final price without first having it taken to an outside shop for inspection, even from a five- star dealer like he claims to be! but, that pending that outcome, i was more than prepared to make a fair offer on the car. wade agreed to take it to a shop my mechanic suggested in the area, but, he also said that unless i gave him an ""up front, out the door price"" that it would be a waste of his time to take it for inspection since it would most likely result in a lower offer and essentially, net him less money!!! but a carfax and dealer claims like wade's, that a car is in great shape, would certainly be a slim reed to hang a major purchase like a used car on, especially when i might be spending close to $20,000! don't know about you, but i certainly want that outside inspection done first, so i know exactly what i might, or might not be buying! to make matters worse, the last email i received was from mike, possibly the owner, who said, ""we have no problem accommodating a buyer by taking the vehicle there, however we have had experiences where buyers have had their vehicles to third party shops, who have been given a clean bill of health and ""thumbs up"" from their selected service shop and then offer a price that isn't feasible for making a purchase. "" they were both obviously afraid i'd make a low offer based on whatever the outside shop inspection found. which must mean they know something would show up on that inspection that would cause me to have concern enough to warrant a lower offer. but, isn't that the whole point of an outside inspection? to protect the consumer from either over paying for a car that isn't worth the amount being asked, and or possibly even buying an unsafe car to begin with?? you tell me!!!"
5-star,1,"i had a really great experience with red rock automotive. the staff is very, very professional, and also very considerate. i explained that i didn't have a car and they picked me up from asu, and then even offered to drive me home (*insert heart emoticon here, yelp won't allow it). unlike other dealers (omg, don't get me started on midway chevrolet), they don't pressure you or call you 100 f***ing million times. unfortunately, i was unable to give them my business because my budget was $5000 (craigslist, woo!), but i've referred several friends here who are looking for cars. apparently, this is the place to go if you want a nissan leaf, haha. they don't have the biggest selection of cars compared to other dealerships, but i'm sure that they are willing to work with anyone who is looking for something outside of their inventory."
5-star,1,"i rarely write any reviews but i thought i would share my experience here. i recently an infiniti from red rock and the entire experience was a+ from beginning to end. if you want straightforward no bs conversation about buying car, talk to wade. none of the tiresome sales tactics that you find everywhere else. seemingly within 30 minutes of the testdrive, i had a great offer on my trade-in... a loan at 2.99% and i placed a deposit to hold the car until the next day. this place checks off all the boxes. -cars are in great condition. -great pricing -great loan rates -fast and easy process"
5-star,1,"this was the easiest car buying experience we've ever had... no pressure, friendly and informative salespeople, and extremely quick! thanks for making this such a pleasant process!"
5-star,1,this is best place in all of phoenix to purchase a vehicle!!! taylor was very helpful and knowledgeable about the vehicles they had on the lot. all the employees are stand up people and really care about your experience and satisfaction!!
5-star,1,we bought a nissan leaf a year ago and loved it so much we wanted a second one! and we found it at red rock auto! going green is easy to do a red rock automotive. they had a great selection of nissan leafs to choose from and we were able to find our second nissan leaf for our family from them! wade was absolutely great to work with. no pressure sales and wade was knowledgeable as myself about the electric vehicles! no hidden fees and a price i was very happy with!
5-star,1,"my husband and i were so impressed with red rock auto!! we came in to look at a 2008 prius, taylor was super friendly and very knowledgeable about the car as we took it on a test run. once we decided to purchase wade took over and he was also great! super kind and genuine people that really care about the quality of the cars they sell! i highly recommend!!"
5-star,1,"we found red rock through carguru and found that they were recommended through our bank as well. we already had financing and a car in mind. we had planned to go to several dealerships to find the lowest price. we drove up from tucson so we weren't wanting to waste a lot of time haggling. we had spoken to wade before driving up and he assured us the car was immaculate and that he would be able to match our price. we looked around the lot and spoke to a few employees, who were all very friendly and genuine. there was no pressure. mike helped us get set up on a test drive and had a good amount of knowledge about the leaf. they had a wide variety of nice cars on the lot, all priced low and looking great. after driving it around, we sat down with wade, gave home our price and he agreed. that was it! emailed the bank info and we were in our way home with our new electric car! the business end of the deal took about 10 minutes- including changing printer toner cartridges ;) i would go back to red rock again and again. highly recommend this shop if you're looking for a deal without pressure or shady practices."
5-star,1,"wade worked hard to get me a great deal that was within my budget, all without a co-sign! he was super communicative with me and honest about everything. the car i bought is a beaut and in great condition. red rock was definitely the place to go for my first car!"
5-star,1,"so very pleased with this awesome business, not only an amazing car dealership but wonderful customer service. i was searching for my perfect car for a couple months and when i found this place i was so grateful. they make the process of buying a car enjoyable! i had the most wonderful experience with all of the staff. the cars are all in tip top shape and their prices are more then reasonable! it's been a couple months since i bought my car and they'll call making sure i'm still happy with my purchase and let me know that if i have any issues to call! my car is perfect, and i have not had any problems with it. i recommend this place to everyone i know buying a car!"
5-star,1,"i found red rock on craigslist, while looking for nissan leafs. surprisingly they had a 2013 with very low miles on it. we looked at it on a sunday and i test drove it 3 times the following week. mike, wade, taylor and dave were all very helpful. they had the leaf charged and ready to drive and answered my many questions. taylor showed me many of the car's functions on a test drive. this car felt like a new car and drove better than the others i test drove at other places. my wife and i went back that saturday and bought the car. mike helped us get where we needed to be. he also kept his word and some scratches taken out by his detailer who did a great job. mike even arranged for my car to be picked up at work and provided a loaner car for the day and had dave bring the leaf back to me at work at the end of the day! well done mike! car looked great! red rock had one of the few leafs with the leather package and the nicer rims, with tinted windows. we get compliments on this leaf! red rock is easy to work with, and has low mileage vehicles. worth your while to check them out!"
5-star,1,"great local place to buy a used car. they really go out of their way to ensure that you are getting exactly what you need and want. no pressure sales and quick, easy financing. whenever i am in need of a vehicle, this is the first place i will call from here on out! it is so nice to have a locally-owned, small automotive business that i can trust. thanks guys! you are awesome!"
5-star,1,such a great experience buying a car. wade is amazing and his boss is just as great. they negotiated and worked with me and got me a car that fit me as well as it working with my price range and needs. i love my new chevy cruze and i'm so glad i went to red rock automotive! i would recommend them to anyone!
5-star,1,"i thought i'd reviewed red rock but it appears i haven't. we've had our 2003 toyota highlander for a little over a year now and just received a follow up call to check in on us. a year follow up call. wow that's unheard of, right? we worked mainly with taylor but everyone there was kind, helpful and courteous. there was no high pressure tactics and i really appreciate the transparency and honesty from the minute i drove on the lot. if they have the car i want or can get it i'd come back here every time. thanks guys for a great experience and vehicle."
5-star,1,"taylor and gang were a pleasure to work with. i made a few trips back, even bringing an obdii device to test the nissan leaf's battery. they charged the car for me, showed me the different features, and worked with me on the price... until we reached a number we could agree on. it was fun showing it off to my family, who were stunned to learn it was used. the red rock folks made it look perfect! i love the car and fully recommend this facility. i wish them the best!"
5-star,1,"man, i just got the best car i've ever owned all thanks to red rock automotive! jason was literally the coolest guy a car buyer could ask for! no pressure, they love what they do so that's how you know you're going to get the best deal possible with a vehicle with low mileage! i traded in my 2004 isuzu ascender for a 2012 ford explorer with 41k miles on it. i originally wanted a gmc terrain, but the seats don't fold all the way down...they showed me this limited ford explorer and blew me away with all the options it has! they couldn't let me know about financing the day of, but it was my fault for getting in there so late. they immediately called me the next morning to let me know i was approved and to come in and pick up my new vehicle! i will recommend rra to everyone i know because of the great experience with the staff and especially their follow-up. thanks red rock!"
5-star,1,i just bought a 2007 toyota with low mileage. i was completely impressed with taylor and mike along with all of their staff. i will definitely be going back for future car purchases. they went above and beyond my customer service expectations. thank you red rock automotive!!
5-star,1,"i bought a low mileage honda crv at red rock automotive and had a wonderful experience. i was dreading car shopping, but they were super friendly and helpful. i never felt pressured to make a decision and there were none of sales tactics you'd expect from a typical dealership. their whole approach seems very honest and transparent. my husband and i will definitely be returning when it's time to upgrade his suv for something newer."
5-star,1,"just purchases a used car from mike, great experience! he was a pleasure to work with and for the first time in our car purchasing history i didn't feel like any game was being played. we felt mike was very honest and fair in our dealings. i'm very comfortable recommending mike and red rock automotive to my family and friends."
5-star,1,"just purchased a 2013 smart from red rock automotive. worked with taylor plant, president and enjoyed the best car buying experience of my life. if your looking for a high quality lightly used auto you need to go see these guys."
5-star,1,this is the best place to buy a car!!! i had the best experience there. they make it so easy and they are so helpful. mike and taylor are the best. and megan the girl at the front desk is also so amazing. after a week of having my cute nissan versa (little boy blue) they phoned me and asked how i was doing and thanked me. then on top of that i received a handwritten thank you card ....that's right handwritten and signed by everyone. they are amazing and i highly recommend them. i will continue to do business with them in the future.
5-star,1,i had a great experience with the operators here at red rock auto. they work as a team and are super friendly mike and taylor. i came in the weekend prior to check out a 2012 nissan leaf and like it. they saved it for me even though others may have asked about it. i came up from tucson the following weekend and bought it! my credit wasn't the best but they did what they can to find me the best lender and we closed the deal and i drove it back to tucson. after a month the car has absolutely no problems what so ever. cars are priced under market rates and saves you hundred's maybe thousand's. -tom luong (purchased 4/11/15)
5-star,1,"mike is the salesmen /owner you want to work with. he is friendly, knows his product and is not pushy. the car we went there for was not exactly what we need for having a second baby but i plan to come back here in the future. definitely a business i want to support."
1-star,0,"internet sales guy is unresponsive, we were approximately $1,000 apart on a $30,000 vehicle and he wouldn't even return my emails. went to a different dealership and bought the same vehicle for $27,000. they will do whatever they can to get out of making warranty repairs. they wanted $700 for a repair that was covered under my warranty. whatever time frame they give you for an oil change at least double it. ."
5-star,1,"i was very pleasantly surprised by the service we received at ron lewis. my husband and i went looking for a new suv and stopped first at ron lewis to look at the 2016 grand cherokee. it was the only vehicle we test drove. bob grimes was our salesman and he is very honest, caring, and doesn't give you your typical ""car buying experience"". we went on a friday to test drive and look around and made an appointment to go back on saturday morning with our trade in and to talk more about leasing. bob told us to come back around noon, so we could get free lunch, and sure enough shortly after noon the dealership brought in pizza for the staff and customers. it was a nice touch, especially since they even offered it to folks just waiting on their free car wash. the car buying process was simple. the dealership offered us in the ballpark of what we wanted for our trade. bob walked us through all of the features and benefits of the vehicle, took us on a tour of the shop, showed us where to go for our free car wash/state inspection, introduced us to the office manager, etc. it made you feel like you became a part of something great, not just buying a car. the office manager who completes the paperwork with you is very nice and high energy and everyone seems to like to chat and joke with the customers in a friendly and welcoming manner. we've owned our jeep for less than a week, so this review is strictly on our car buying experience - but so far, so good on the jeep. we love it and i hope to continue to have a good experience with not only the vehicle, but also with the dealership."
1-star,0,"dealerships like this one make me want to own a horse. everything about the experience from sales to service was expensive and poorly executed. they are clearly interested in nothing other than taking your money and making you feel like crap. i read other reviews that said the owner was bad but honestly i never met him. i did however meet a guy named mr. peterson and he is the personification of a used car salesman. btw i have good credit, good job, etc. (i also vote and recycle lol) so this post isn't from some weirdo with a ax to grind..."
5-star,1,"bought a car from ron lewis in pleasant hills. kenny shotter is the best! i was determined to not spend hours in the dealership negotiating, waiting for the finance guys, etc. kenny was most accommodating and all the business was done by email. in the end, we walked in, went over the paperwork, signed and drove off. kenny always responded quickly to my emails and answered all my questions fully. the price for my trade and the price for the car i bought were both excellent prices based on extensive research i did. i wouldn't hesitate to buy a car again from ron lewis in pleasant hills."
1-star,0,worst owner ever!!!! my fiancé was waiting on a new ram truck to come in and asked that he be called as soon as it came in. well it came in and the owner (ron lewis) decided to take it as his demo. the manager that my fiancé spoke to said he would be able to get the truck back. a little while later the manager called back and said the owner has now decided to keep the truck. now what that means is he's just going to keep it as his demo for 5000 miles then sell it at a little bit of a discounted price. this has been the worst experience buying a car ever and we are loyal dodge owners. my fiancées toy is an srt for crying out loud. this is not a place i would ever recommend anyone to buy a car. the owner of the company doesn't care about his customers satisfaction at all and if he doesn't then obviously he's not going to care if his employees do either. we will be going to a different dodge dealership for now on. this dealer will never get our business again and i would suggest he doesn't get yours either.
1-star,0,yeah no.... wish i would have checked yelp before calling him. just very rude and did not take the time to listen. i found someone else to do the job!! happy that i did not start to use him and end up like others on here. just steer away now and save yourself some time and money.
1-star,0,worst mechanic ever he told me he changed all 8 of my spark plugs but he changed only 6 he didnt changed the 2 closes to the fire wall. so he comes back the next day to show me he did he pulls out the closes to the firewall on the passenger side and its so bad he changes it okay then he pulls out the one next to it i said no the one on the driverside closes to the firewall he said no i aint doing it i chnaged it already i said okay but when you took out the 8 plug it wasnt changed you had to changed it and just so happen you had the part yeah cause thats the plug i bought and gave you yesterday so take out the driver side back plug closes to the firewall and he refuses to when he know he only changed 6 and because he changed the passenger back next to the firewall he now changed 7 wtf kind of mechanic is that im so mad and then charged me 200 dollars pissed me off then he is mad cause he said he waited for me an hr and yet he didnt finish the job dont use the guy he is a rip off and a liar
1-star,0,sorry excuse for a mechanic left my car in worse shape than when i gave it to him. stay away. he fix one thing and broke another and try to charge me to fix the thing that he broke.
1-star,0,"the person i encountered today is a man of foul character to say the least. while at a stop light on horizon ridge in henderson, he cursed profanities and called me a nigger over a loud pa system because i didn't pull off fast enough from the light. not only was my 7 year old with me, he also had a young child in this business' vehicle. he assumed i was on the phone but in reality i was having a conversation with my child which delayed my driving. nonetheless, his behavior was quite upsetting and foolish since he was in a branded business vehicle with a phone #. this review is to advise him to change his antics as someone could easily find him for retribution. you did not ruin my day, nor did your disrespect harden me but instead it was a great learning lesson for my son about how ignorant some people can be and to always be the bigger and smarter person as he may come in contact with that same little boy you are misguiding and my son needs to be prepared."
1-star,0,"glad i didn't let this shady mfer anywhere near my truck! doesn't take credit cards, b+ better business rating, most reviews on facebook & yelp are so low that when i voice my concerns, he stopped replying! also he's not licensed or bonded"
1-star,0,"this man is a fraud!!! please do not do business with him. he is very unprofessional and dishonest. he knows little to nothing about cars. broke a very expensive part because he didn't want to take the part off the car properly, now i have a bigger problem on my hands. when he came to fix my car he was not prepared to even work on my car. he showed up in shorts and tank top. he promise to come back and complete the job.when trying to call or text him he will not respond.he will take your money and run!!! please please please stay away!!!"
1-star,0,"he sucks!! check out previous people who were ripped off! he took they're hard earned money, along with mine, trusted this a-hole to fix their vehicle, left me with a truck that doesn't run, and won't do anything about it!"
1-star,0,very quick reliable to come out and see what's wrong i found my own part set up day and time he was an hour and a half late not one call to say running late or anything ..then he sets time and date mothers day to come 12 it was 200 i finally get ahold of him says sorry running behind ..in a text tried verbal was sent to voice mail ..so needless to say gave him benefit of the doubt he would show waiting till 6pm still no show text or call nothing what a wonderful way to spend mothers day ...i even text this morning to see excuse and no answer or return call and to top it off he knew my tags were due last day to get everything done ..to be able to renew .. so unprofessional ....
5-star,1,"ruben helped me out with my 2010 lexus lx570 face-lift conversion to 2015 by setting up my electrical connections to the new headlights and installing my new side mirror turn signals. he rewired everything to make sure my drl, hid low, high beams, parking, and clearance sites were working to factory specs. he arrived on time, worked really fast, cleaned up, and made sure i was happy with the work before he left. great experience and will definitely use again."
5-star,1,"called ruben in the morning, described the issues i was having. he came out pretty much when he said he would and found the reasoning for all the issues. first was a wiring issue with my headlight that several others have failed to fix. he fixed the issue within 30 minutes and even explained why. the second issues was with my battery light coming on pretty much every day. he found the reason and let me know that he can fix it however at the end of the day the problem wasn't going to leave me stranded or get worse. i really appreciated that - a crook would have tried to sell me on the unnecessary fix. the third issue ended up being an issue where parts aren't available locally. however he gave me a temporary fix to the problem and gave me the actual part that needed to be repaired so i could compare to make sure i had the right part - even offered to find the part for me - although i declined that service. i've seen some of the other reviews - i honestly can't speak to what happens if a repair doesn't go right however based on my experiences i wouldn't have issue calling him again (in fact i plan on it when i get my new parts!). fair with pricing as well - he didn't charge me windshield time...i hate it when i have to pay for your drive time. never even tried."
5-star,1,i've dealt with ruben a few times for minor car fixes. recently my engine was ruined and i needed serious help. serious help as in an engine swap. ruben found a low mileage engine and had me back on the road well under the originally estimated time. as always ruben was on point and got the job done well.
1-star,0,"ok where do i start? i'll just get to the point! avoid this guy if at all possible!!!! at first he seems a little off, then he seems like he knows what he is doing. don't be fooled. he is as off as he looks. he just cares about getting paid. once he does he won't fix his mistakes. avoids calls and doesn't have the decency to keep his word!"
1-star,0,2/13 ruben charged me $1500 to rebuild my transmission. 4 months later my transmission went out. called him and he picked up my car. he had it another week and would not return my calls. finally get a hold of him and he says the car is done. get the car back and it wouldn't even drive. started calling him again. no answer! had to tow the car away $70 and the new mechanic says nothing was done to my transmission. now i have to pay $1800 for a new transmission. i have been calling for over a week demanding my money back. i found him on facebook and demanded my money back and instead of replying he deleted my messages and posted pics of him holding guns!!!! how professional is this?
1-star,0,worse service every not reliable at all discussed day and time on friday too have car looked at on monday at 8 am unfortunately it rained all day monday so couldn't come work on car discussed that he would come work on the car today at 8 am and he would call at 7 am too confirm received no call at all texted and called several times would never recommend to any one avoid this person very unsatisfied
4-star,1,car trouble? need a tow? breaks going bad? time for that oil change or a tune up? rubens mobile solutions is ready to assist with reasonable rates. he will meet you at your location to fix your car. ruben has also found the best deals on parts to make the best use of my money. he has taken care of the needs of my cars & my family's cars. i highly recommend his service!!!
1-star,0,"my sister was shopping at sam's club at this location. a business can operate however they wish, but the entry/exit here is being handled poorly and very unprofessionally. they are not letting anyone else in because it's close to closing time. i'm here with my truck to pick up what my sister has purchased. the security guard is telling everyone coming up to the entrance, ""no one goes in!"", then turns to a fellow employee and says, ""welcome to my nightmare!"" and gestures to all of us standing outside. there is a thin, yellow tape across the road on both sides of the door. totally unmanned and cars repeatedly drive up and have to back up. can there not be a reflective vested employee monitoring pick ups? or traffic in general? can someone teach the security on duty an etiquette lesson?"
5-star,1,"just rejoined after several years away. signed up in order to purchase the special 1 day deals on 11/11. the people were very nice and accommodating considering how busy they were all day. friendly and helpful staff. definitely some great values and products that costco doesn't carry. especially love the fact i can use any credit card...discover, visa, mc and amex!!! definitely recommended!!"
2-star,0,"you've lost a long-time customer. after 15 years of shopping at this sam's club, today was my last day. the cashiers treat customers with such disdain that the savings are not close to worth it. the training for cashiers must be non-existent. today i only had 2 items when i went to check out. i went in the shortest line which meant the customer ahead of me only had about 6 items. halfway through scanning the items, the cashier abruptly left and went back into the bowels of the store with no word to the other customers waiting in line. after i lost sight of her, i changed lines. in that line the customer only had two items. that cashier seemed to be having trouble scanning. finally he got the tv scanned and asked the customer if he wanted the 4 year warranty. yes, so the cashier asked the supervisor 10 feet away to type up a warranty. no response. the cashier asked again. the supervisor said he would start working on it. again, no contact with everyone else waiting in line to say ""sorry, this will take a minute."" in fact no recognition of other customers at all. this is a poorly run store with poor customer interaction. i recommend you stay away."
2-star,0,"this is in regards to the sam's club pharmacy. i called today when they opened about a prescription to see if it was ready (i had previously enrolled in the text program where they'll contact you via text when the prescription is ready--which is very nice). i never did receive a text or call about it being ready. i spoke with a pharmacy tech associate who rudely answered the phone and proceeded to tell me how i will have to contact them to see if the prescription is ready because i can't rely on the text program. okay. fair enough. i then said i'd like for my prescription to be filled (since it had been 10 days since my doctor sent it over and i hadn't picked it up--after ten days, they shelf it). fast forward 2 hours later, i go to the store check on it and (hopefully) pick it up, the same associate said, ""oh, i didn't know you were wanting it so it didn't get filled, it'll be 40 minutes."" it would be great if the employees there were respectful, smiling, and not blame everything on the customer (guess it was my fault somehow though i did everything right?) suggestion in the future: hire better employees and maybe fix the method of letting customers know when their prescription is ready."
1-star,0,"the store itself is fine, typical sam's club. just do not try the pickup option. they take so long to bring out your order you might as well do the shopping yourself, there is no time saved. also i've done pickup here 4 times now and they have made mistakes every time. wrong products, missing items, additional items not ordered, it keeps getting worse. the worst was today, i'm sick so i sent my boyfriend to pickup and they pulled a receipt from several weeks ago and filled that instead of what i ordered. total mess and i don't have the time to go back and return the stuff i don't need. never again."
1-star,0,"went into costco because i won't be spending my money at sam's because of rudeness and ineptness of their employees. much greater variety of inventory but more importantly, friendly and efficient associates. i didn't wait 5 minutes in line for a couple of sandwiches and when it was my turn the lady at the counter greeted me with a friendly ""hello, may i help you"" and when i asked another for a bag to carry out he told me they didn't have bags but he would look for a box for me. he disappeared to the back, obviously went to some trouble and returned with a box, packed the box up and was polite. when i asked for a bag at sam's the young woman rudely informed they didn't have any and turned her back to me. it seems the sam's associates are an overall unhappy bunch and they treat customers accordingly. go join costco and you will be much happier and so will the manager at sam's because it willl mean fewer complaints for her."
1-star,0,"i am a sams plus member, and really wanted to have my tires changed in scottsdale's sams club. however, i have been trying to call the store on the phone, and no one picks the call. it's been two days now, and i don't know why no one picks up calls at this branch, but just because of this, i have no choice but to have my tires changed at discount tire."
5-star,1,"optical only i've been getting my glasses at sam's club optical for years and one of the techs, melanie is just terrific . if she ever leaves i am going to follow her!! she is customer focused, very personable and helps the customer make a good selection. she is precise in her fitting, very professional and confident. melanie is an assest to the organization and the reason i go to sam's year after year for my glasses."
1-star,0,"i purchased a groupon for sam's club renewal fee plus a $20 gift card. this proved to be a very difficult transaction for some reason as i spent over 25 minutes at member service counter to renew my membership. i then paid for my purchases with the $20 gift card and put the balance on the credit card. by the time i got back to the car, something didn't quite add up so i looked at my receipt - the cashier added $20 to my purchases instead of giving me a credit of $20 for using the gift card. so it was back to member service counter for another 30 minutes.... i know i don't always look at receipts; i wonder how many times this cashier has made the same mistake with other customer? i couldn't have been the first customer using a gift card! the membership fee is not worth the hassle - costco has similar pricing with products of much higher quality."
2-star,0,i like sams club for the variety of items they carry. it's a clean store. what i don't like is how there are vendors are allowed to come up to you and buy their product. it's like a high pressure sales.
5-star,1,"sam's club is close to costco, and you might think that it works be unnecessary, and you'd be wrong. sam's club sells many different brands from costco, and sometimes the place to find certain items is at sam's. when they have the same items, they are comfortable prices (within a few cents). they also will have special deals in neat that the sell by date is approaching quickly i live where there is no sam's club, but i keep my membership for traveling on the mainland."
1-star,0,"i have been standing in line, and am the next person in line for about 15 min with no end in sight, just to renew my membership. if i did not need this i would have left. costco is so much more efficient. hard to understand why anyone shops here who does not have to."
5-star,1,diana in the jewellery department always has the best advice on everything you need for any holiday or engagement! i dive out to this location for her expertise alone! thanks for all the help and i'll be back!
1-star,0,"this rating is for the photo processing area. today i went to pick up slides that i had left there and also to have them rectify two poorly processed photos which i only noticed when i got home. (i had processed over 90 photos) so i get there and the guy i had previously dealt with was off. ok no problem. i looked for help and a lady who works for sam's was unable to look for the slides where i told her they were. (i saw where the prior guy had stored them.) then, i asked for the pictures to be corrected. at the point she advised me that all the machines were out of order. so i spent money on gas to get to a place that doesn't even have one working photo machine. not good. i usually get photos done at their competitor down the road, but decided to give them a try. how does one pronounce, ""bad idea""?"
4-star,1,i was very happy st sams club tires. jay really knows his business! i learned a lot about why i should have my tires inflated to a certain number. you'll have to ask jay yourself but it is worth the trip over there. the wait time was minimal but sometimes inevitable that you might have to wait some. its really worth it!!
1-star,0,"totally burned off on sam's. first of all the credit card policy is terrible. master card or debit card only. the sam's in georgia take visa, sam's in cozumel mexico takes all major credit cards! so, they burned through my cash to purchase two tires for my yukon, balance and rotate all of them. i left for california the next morning and the vibration was totally nerve racking. stopped at america auto depot in lemon grove california and had all the tires re-balanced. every tire was several ounces out of balance."
2-star,0,"i have been going to this sam's club for many years. i like coming here. i like most of the people working here except one. there is one person who flies under the radar. it's peter the greeter. more like peter the dirty old man. when he first started working there in 2010 he saw me and took my card out of my hand and turned it over to read my name thereby forcing me to engage in polite conversation with him for about a mntue. he thought i was interested in him; he is old enough to be my father or older. he then for a few months would touch my shoulder every time i came in and left the store forcing me to look up a him. then one night when no one was leaving the exit he moved from the entrance to the exit to catch me leaving to check my receipt and quickly put his arms around me before i had time to brace myself and gave me a squeeze. i called the manager the next morning crying. it has been 4 years now and peter has now gotten bolder towards me when he checks my ticket he gets close to my face with his angry look and says ""have a nice day ma'am"" as i walk out the door. he does this while his coworkers aren't around. other times he behaves and won't act like that to me. i hope peter has a nice day too! it has been 4 years and he still has a bruised ego. i have never had a problem with anyone in this store before like this. what a weirdo."
1-star,0,"being long time happy members of costco, we decided to go to sam's today during their open house to see how it compared. we were totally unimpressed with the lack of customer service, the unfriendly and unhappy looking and acting employees, the fact that we were not made aware until we went to pay for our purchase that they did not accept visa or american express, our only 2 cards. we will definitely stay with costco and not bother to go back to sam's!"
5-star,1,get your lunch here! very inexpensive and always tastes great! the lady with red hair and the young guy with glasses are the only ones who have a nice personality!
5-star,1,my wife wanted a pair of boots that weren't in stock .tanya at the members desk went out of her way calling other stores to locate the item we needed .great job great employee . thanks tanya ! a.c.alonso
1-star,0,came here because a groupon made it basically free and i still overpaid. first of all they did not have all the items promised in the groupon. we were in at 6:30 pm and they had no rotisserie chickens. this place is a joke compared to costco. we will be canceling.
3-star,0,"i came here after christmas with a friend who had a guess card. we came away reasonably impressed. years ago, we use to shop at sam's when the concept was first rolled out by walmart's. at some point, my parents renewed our card, as a small thank you for giving them the second card and poof! somehow sam's thought it was their card. and that, is the short version of how we started shopping at costco. funny stuff. sam's is a-ok in our book. whether it's ""peter the greeter"", or ""jay in tires"", everyone we met that day impressed us with their product knowledge and friendliness. sam's prices seem as good as costco, though it tough eyeballing things. each has it's own unique products, found only in their store. so how do you compare ""house"" brands to national ones? but if you are looking for cheap and basic, i believe sam's might have the advantage over costco. also, each wholesale club has it's own market. back east, bj's seems to be king. everywhere else, it appears to be evenly split -- with costco having an edge on the west coast. like most, we cannot shop here every week. we tend to come once every three weeks or so, to pickup specific items. we like sam's, but prefer costco. in the end i guess, sam's did us a favor all those years ago. enjoy!"
4-star,1,"i, like several others, prefer sam's to costco. i like the food variety more, they always carry items that appeal to me. i love cooking...and the goodies i get from sam's work out better for me. i also get my eye glasses here, have been for the past 10 years."
4-star,1,"after a year of visiting this sam's i'm giving it 4 stars because i like it much better than costco around the corner (15255 north hayden road, scottsdale). why is this? well, first off let's say that i buy only certain items here, as i don't do my regular ""grocery"" shopping at this joint. ready made bags of salad, about 3 bucks. land o' lakes sharp cheddar cheese, 2 lbs., about 5-6 bucks. get the idea? great for parties and entertaining as well. great place to stock up on bbq sauce, coffee, tortilla chips, a-1, charcoal for smoking and grilling, and a few other items. big plus for me vs. costco, it's rarely crowded, and i can run in grab 2-3 items, and be out in less than 10 minutes. try that at costco!"
2-star,0,"it is like a parallel bizarre universe, you walk in everything seems familiar but not quite right. this is what sams club is, it is like costco, but just not nearly as good, lower quality products, a odd selection, useless staff and a lack of customers as a result. the only highlight of this store is the hummus, they sell sabra hummus in large family size containers for a bargain at $6. i did see a recent addition of a house brand and i hope this is not a sign of change. if you want a sample you are out of luck too, despite there only being a hand full of other customers, the sample people are painfully slow, and do not create a cache of samples to buffer demand. i walked around and just felt odd and out of place. also prices on some items are much higher than other places. a 1.75 of makers mark bourbon was $35 when it can be had for $27 at costco. unless you have agoraphobia there is no real reason to shop here."
4-star,1,"i like this sam's. i get my eye exams/contacts/glasses here and some groceries. it's almost always pretty dead and therefore easy to get in and out quickly and easily. they don't have nearly the selection that most costco do, but i've never waited in line here."
1-star,0,"the only reason i am giving this 1 star even though i will probably go back to do some shopping for packaged food and such from time to time but will no longer be tasting the free food is the fact that i witnessed one of the food tasters blowing her nose while standing at a food tasting table, and not only did she not wash her hands, but she did not change the plastic gloves that she was wearing before continuing to handle food to give out as samples. i was so stunned that i just had to walk away. yes it was my fault for not bringing it to a managers attention but if you could have seen the stunned look on my face. she did not notice me but i damn sure noticed her. stunned! i remember exactly what she looks like and will be reporting her but again just stunned that she did that in plain view of everyone. can we say blech?!?!"
5-star,1,"thanks to brian and the team for the great service today!!! sent my mother in there because she had a slow leak in two tires. asked them to remove the tires from the rims, clean, grind, seal, remount and balance! in and out in 20 min! price quoted exactly what was charged. will definitely be returning when we need work done again. thanks guys!"
1-star,0,very dishonest people. a gentleman answered the phone and identified himself as brian and gave me a quote and an appointment. when i went in today a young punk was behind the counter and said that brian quoted me wrong as he didn't know know what he was doing. this young guy scrolled through a diary with a lot of markings and said that he could not find my quote or appointment. he suggested that i shouldn't shop around for tires and just settle for his quote which was almost $ 200 more than brian's quote. my whole saturday ruined because of their inefficiency and miscommunication. i wonder how they stay in business.
5-star,1,got 4 decent all season tires installed recently at a good price. within 5 minutes my car was in the shop being worked on. i got a coffee and came back and it was done. after waiting half an hour at canadian tire only to be told they don't have any tires that fit my car this was a welcome trait. the guy behind the counter was super nice and answered any questions i had. the tires have been great so far. they offer free tire rotations with my tire purchase as well.
1-star,0,"do not go here! the manager here is dishonest and not trustworthy. called in to ask about tire change pricing and was quoted at $15 per tire. went to get the tires changed and after the job was done, was told that it was $20 per tire! i immediately complained and pointed to the fact that i was quoted $15 over the phone and they should honor that price. the manager then tried to make up some lie about my tires costing more because they were 17"", to which my reply was, yes if he remembered i told him over the phone my rims were 17"" and he was the one who quoted me at $15! of course he then denied all of it. do yourself a favour and avoid this place unless you want to get ripped off and have to argue with dishonest people!"
3-star,0,i've been going to this shop for at least 10 years and i am satisfied with their service. normally you don't have to wait long but if possible make an appointment.
5-star,1,"the work was very well done - i can not see where they fixed it they did so good, the communication was excellent and on time - they entire process from renting a car from enterprise in their store to communication to quality of work is all 5 stars!!!!"
5-star,1,awesome job! service king did a fabulous job on my 2015 dodge ram. gabby was awesome thanks for treating me like family and jim did an excellent job on my ram would recommend this shop to anyone looking for great service and great work!
5-star,1,man this place is exceptional. luis gomez took care of my car with fast speed and care. this will be my new body shop anytime something happens to my car.
5-star,1,"service king took great care of both of my cars, they were super friendly from the receptionist to my mechanic. larry consistently kept me updated through out the time both my cars was in the shop. great service! thanks service king for easing my troubles away."
5-star,1,brought our honda here after someone punched two huge dents in the side of our car. service kings not only repaired it to perfect condition but the staff was very friendly and accommodating.
1-star,0,"we had been in a accident and taken it here. i told mechanic that suspension light came on. back when of car totaled. when i picked up he said that person didn't have time to figure out why suspension light was on but car was fine. now suspension light is on and our car (front and back suspension) squeaks everytime we go over a bump. car aged years! my husband called and same thing, has nothing to do with accident. no have taken it to another shop and they said absolutely suspension can be effected by being rear end that badly. more time. more of a fight with insurance. all because he just wanted to be done with us."
1-star,0,"called and told them i needed an estimate to paint a limo. had to call a call center after i talked with the local office to make said appointment. when i got there they told me they don't paint limos. i told them i spoke with 2 different people, one local and one at the call center and told both i needed a limo painted. and the person i was scheduled to speak with as set by the call center wasn't even there. this place isn't very customer service friendly and they do not listen to you when you speak. please be aware."
1-star,0,"i'll start out with what i expect out of any establishment that i do business with. i expect the service that's being provided not only to me but anyone to be above and beyond. you've not only chosen the particular business out of who knows how many other establishments that offer the same service. service king did in fact deliver my car earlier that i expected. the area that had the work done was in fact done properly and cleaned but just in the area that the work was done. the dust that went inside my car along the outside was not cleaned. now my wife had her car fixed by auto nation and i must say they took the time to detail the outside and inside of the car for giving them your business. now ""service king"" key word service king only patches up and returns your car no attention to detail no sign of respect for your property. if providing your customers with free water, coffee and candy is your definition of service then they did a he'll of a job. now i will say that i didn't give service king a chance to write the wrong, only because their in the service of making sure that every attention to details are met. it is not my job nor do i get paid by them to explain what mistakes they have done. giving the self the title service king should hold better expectations"
1-star,0,"this place is one of the worst businesses i have came across in las vegas. i had a written estimate stating they would change the side panels, rear panel, bumper etc. on my 50,000.00 truck. went to pick up the truck today and everything had been bondo-ed, the paint had pits in it, even air bubbles is the crappy bondo work. needless to say i will have to start all over with another shop to get it repaired properly. they are scammers, and lie straight to your face . do not do business with service king collision repairs."
5-star,1,my vehicle came out of the shop waaaayyy better than it was when i brought it in. i love the text message notifications because i was kept updated throughout the process of repairing my car. staff was super friendly and i love the positive atmosphere in the office. hopefully i dont need to come back to this place but i know where to go if i do! thanks service king! you guys went beyond my expectations!
5-star,1,"someone hit my car in the parking lot of one of the casinos back in december just before christmas. i was able to get my car towed into their shop and they did the estimate and work on it, in about a month before i could get my car back. they kept my updated once sometimes twice a week, so that i knew i was being taken care of.i just got it back never would have known someone got it with the amazing work they did on it. thank you everyone at service king!"
1-star,0,"i can't actually comment on the quality of work they do because the work never got done. i called three times over the course of three weeks checking on the status of my parts order, was always told someone would call me back. but nobody ever did. they blamed it on ""holiday shipping"". the day i took it elsewhere they finally called to say the parts were in. it took four weeks for a spoiler to arrive. then they wanted me to wait another week to schedule the repairs. save yourself the agony. i took my car to las vegas collision on valley view. they started the repairs the day i took it in for an estimate and had it back, repairs done beautifully, in four days total."
5-star,1,"this is the second time i've taken my car to service king collision repair of falconis--they truly have the best customer service and do a superb job at auto body repairs. mark adams was my contact for the repairs. he answered all of my questions and gave me updates throughout the time my car was in the shop. the process was quick and seemless. highly, highly recommend him! 10 out of 10 rating in all areas."
5-star,1,"i was directed here for an insurance claim. from the moment i walked in to the moment i pulled my perfectly repaired car away everything was fantastic! the front desk service was friendly & helpful. for the repair, i was assigned jim. he answered all my questions, walked me through the what would be happening. he was so professional! during the 3 days that they had my car, i received occasion ""up-date"" text messages. nice touch! and jim would send a personal update e-mail every day. i would absolutely go back here, but i hope i never need to! sorry jim, nothing personal!!"
1-star,0,"bad experience. they gave me one price - then after we started, they raised the price. it would have been difficult to then change. so felt bait and switch like. don't trust there quote. don't use service king."
5-star,1,"i was recently in my first major car accident. totally shaken up and frantic geico pointed me into the trustful hands of service king. i'll admit i was skeptical my baby would ever look or ride the same after her gruesome accident, however, tommy and his boys down at service king really impressed me!! after replacing the entire front drivers side of my mustang, they even went as far as buffing out the fog from my passenger side headlight so they both look brand new! my car hasn't looked, driven, or turned heads this much for a while and i have big tom and the boys to thank for it!"
1-star,0,"i had some front end damage last year and chose this shop because i was under the impression that they could do a simple repair and quick. the repair would have been quicker but i have geico and they don't have a resident agent for estimates. i got over that tho. i had my car back in about a week. and the work looked good. i looked closer and noticed some corners were cut. when i say they cut corners they literally cut some corners. the drivers corner below my headlight had been ripped and they went ahead and just cut damage off the bumper damaging it even more. the clips that hold the bumper on the passenger side have been bent and no longer hold the bumper in place causing the paint to chip in the corner. there are drips in the paint/clear coat and the lack of ""the professional installation and poor fender/hood gaps tells me to never recommend this place to anyone. i sure hope they fallow through with there lifetime policy too. i am a very un happy customer."
1-star,0,"i chose this location because of the yelp reviews. sadly, my service advisor did not help me out. jim k. did not make any effort to work with me at all. he takes a long and i mean loong time to get back to you. it's very hard to get in touch with him and simply does not make you and your car a priority. living in vegas, a/c is vital when driving around! guess he did not realize that. he acted like he was doing me a favor and seemed annoyed because my situation is minor compare to other repairs. if you get assigned to him, i suggest you get switched to another service advisor."
5-star,1,i was hit in an accident and out of all the insurance offered places to fix it i picked this one couldn't be happier staff is awesome and courteous the waiting area is clean and lots of areas to charge your phone and free water and snacks. not to mention the work on my car was very superb. just all around a trustworthy body shop im very happy i brought my car here.
5-star,1,"i did not think i would write a review for a body shop but this group is great, i had originally dropped the car off at the spring valley location but they were booked. they took it to this one and the job was completed on time. they even matched black for a bumper repair, not an easy task for an 8-year old car. they were also in touch every step of the way. i originally chose them because my service shop recommended them. i am glad i listened."
1-star,0,i do not recommend this place we bought a used tire on friday (03.30.18) saturday the tire pressure light came on so sunday 04.01.18 we took it back up there and they did not want to do anything about it! so we decided to come back today 04.02.18 to speak with the manager & the manager said no refund or warranty on used tires. but they checked the tire & it had a hole in it!!! so they sold us a used tire with a hole in it!! patched the tire and said it may last 6 months... they are selling damaged used tires!!! beware!
1-star,0,i highly recommend anyone not to get anything from this place i was a very loyal customer until i noticed they sabotage your valve so that you have to buy a new one that's just wrong
1-star,0,"i do not recommend this place. i bought 2 used tires on 6/07/17 and by 7/02/17 i had a bubble on one of the tires i bought from them. i couldn't get the tire off due to them stripping my lugs. i had to brake the lugs off and buy new ones, which was a pain because i had to go to two different stores to get 10 of them since stores don't tend to buy in bulk. i then notice that this place put two different size tires. i didn't notice that until another tire shop informed me. this place will mess up and cost you money and they won't care. if you want to go here check out that they have the right size, beware of used tires and put the tires on yourself! and save yourself the anguish."
4-star,1,"we stopped in on saturday morning, for an emergency brake replacement. we had seen the shop on the way home the night before, and it was the closest non-chain we could find. (tend to think chains are rip offs.) the guys we interacted with were all very polite. we were told $140 for the brakes, and that it would take about an hour. in reality, it was about 2.5 hours, but someone had to go out to buy a part. not a horrible offense, but it made the rest of our day a little rushed. although 2.5 hours is better than dying because your brakes fail. they did excellent work. no more grinding, no more squeaking. the brakes feel tight and secure. excellent work. we will definitely return if we need any further assistance."
5-star,1,"this place looked a little sketchy but they came in strong when we needed them. after using the terrible car wash next door, we got a flat tire and sierra auto was cheap (12$), fast, and friendly. they patched a hole in our tire of our dodge dart and did a great job. thank you!"
5-star,1,"these guys are the real deal. i had the incorrect image files, and they were able to recreate my logo and mock-ups in less than 5 minuets. they helped me with positioning, to create the look i wanted. absolutely professional and friendly throughout the whole process. thank you signature graphics!"
5-star,1,"cory and ken were awesome. deigned my partial wrap, made changes when i asked, and got the car done ahead of schedule. great crew to work with."
5-star,1,"very happy with my elements massage studio wrap. great design! looks wonderful, very high quality. and great people to work with. thank you so much!"
5-star,1,i would like to thank ken and cory for the great job on our first company vehicle wrap. the professional service from this company from design to installation could not have been any better. a very sincere thank you from airpark pak n ship.
5-star,1,"these guys did a fantastic job applying carbon fiber wrap to parts of my car. before coming to signature, i looked at several other shops, most of whom said that what i wanted done could not be done. ken and the folks at signature gave the job a much more thorough inspection and came up with a creative solution to make it work. they provided the best service, quality of work and value for money. i will certainly return directly to their shop for any future wraps and will recommend them to friends without hesitation."
5-star,1,"ken, scott and the rest of the staff are awesome and the best at their trade. if you own a business and are looking to advertise on your vehicles, have them do it. they are detail oriented, prompt, and professional."
5-star,1,"i am so impressed with this company. ken, scott and the team there really accommodated my needs and made my project come to life. i am so grateful for their hard work, creative effort and awesomeness!"
5-star,1,"signature graphics is one of my favorite vendors to deal with. i have used them for the last year on numerous off the wall projects. they wrapped a led poker table for me and my client went nuts. she love it so much that we did it again the following month! signature graphics has also made signs for me. we had a mishap once and they made me another one on the same exact day and let me keep both signs. i recently had an event that i needed a sign for and i spaced out on ordering it and i realized i needed it on friday and it was thursday night at 5pm! i emailed ken and he responded immediately and told me he would have it done the next day. we picked up the sign at 2pm on friday and there was no rush charge on it. i really appreciate a vendor that takes care of their customers. i will never look elsewhere when i need services of this type in the valley. signature graphics is my go-to spot. thanks for everything, ken!"
5-star,1,"phenomenal. that is really the only thing i need to say! ken and scott are simply the best! if i could post a 10 star review, i would. i have been using these guys for years and keep coming back time and time again for our new vehicles. from commercial wraps to custom graphics, they do it all. i have never had a problem with any of their products. he is worth every single dime and then some. if you are looking for a wrap or custom graphics, stop searching and call now!"
5-star,1,"holy cow these guys are amazing!!!! i came in with a vague idea and they made my ducati look ever so awesome!! very high quality and i was blown away by the turn around time!! even though it looked like they were slammed, they got me in and out so quickly!! i am just so impressed with the service and how my bike turned out! i can tell they took a lot of care to how they handled my bike and left me feeling confident that it was in good hands! i would highly recommend them!!!"
5-star,1,"signature graphics of arizona offers excellence in service! i highly recommend them, i have done business with them a few times already and their sense of business ethics, professionalism, superb quality, and top service makes me keep returning for more:) thank you guys for your excellent service and keep up the great work!"
5-star,1,"thank you so much ken, once again, fantastic results with my jeep wrap and the fine detailing getting my spot off from my travels .. these boys always go the extra mile and i will always return . my solo owned and operated business has a solid brand and the mobile wrap has been amazing for me as i travel outa state for my biz as well . i will refer anyone to ken he's a very very professional owner and thank you scott for your attentive detail skills and listening to my specific needs ;) not to mention anyone my dog likes is normally a hands up great person to work with :)))) thank you thank you thank you michi and i thank you hairdoctk"
5-star,1,i had signature graphics do a wrap on my work truck and i would recommend them to anyone looking to do any kind of wrap on their vehicle. scott and ken were very helpful and very easy to work with. the wrap turned out awesome and i will be using them for any future projects. matt v.
5-star,1,"been using ken for years for all my company vehicles and he has always done a excellent job for us. he is always on time with the completion of the wraps. if you need your car wrapped, you can't go wrong with signature graphics."
5-star,1,signature graphics and ken wrapped my bmw with stripes. the design was awesome and the attention to detail is beyond immaculate! i would highly recommend them to anyone!!
5-star,1,"i've used ken and sg for many years on numerous projects. they run a first class operation and i believe are the best wrap company in az. i have shopped around in the past, but they have always come through with the best pricing and they always use the finest wrap materials available. sg also stands behind their work should any issue arise. highly recommend!"
5-star,1,"""simply the best"" ken and his team are truly masters of what they do. from the customer service to the final product, 150% satisfied! signature graphics will be my go to for amazing wraps on my personal vehicles as well as all graphics for my business. g.m."
5-star,1,"the guys at sg are true masters of their craft. they have the skills and know-how to make any vehicle turn heads, whether it's a full wrap or simple accents. do yourself a favor a pay them a visit next time you're shopping around for all things wraps and graphics, you won't be disappointed!"
5-star,1,"i have been using signature graphics for the past 5 years to wrap my bus, three trailers and graphics on my exotic cars, a freightliner tractor and my pick up trucks. personalized, quality service by ken and his staff. fast, reasonable and excellent work. i would recomend them to anyone. chuck f."
5-star,1,ken and his team at signature graphics are awesome! we opened up a gym in scottsdale called fieldfit and we needed a unique design to fit our concept. they did an unreal job finding something that would match what we were looking for. we had a strict deadline we had to meet and they went above and beyond to meet it. our plan is to open up locations all around the valley and they will be the first ones we call!!
5-star,1,"i couldn't be happier with the work that signature graphics did on my truck wrap!! kenny and his crew do amazing work with attention to every detail. i was happy with the price and blown away by the craftsmanship. if you need graphics work, i highly recommend the guys at signature graphics!!"
5-star,1,the guys at signature graphics rock. we had our smart cars wrapped with them 4 years ago and now we send all of our customers to them for professional wraps. if they didn't earn my 5 star rating...trust me i wouldn't send my clients to them. they are truly an extension of our team.
5-star,1,"if you are like me, you love small businesses that do quality work for a reasonable price. signature graphics did some basic wrap work on my car and it turned out great. price was fair, job was well done, things went as promised, and they even gave me a ride to and from the shop. the owner is very honest, upfront, and obviously pays attention to detail. i'd absolutely use them again for any decal work or wrap work."
5-star,1,"in and out super fast nobody was there so i got right in and in 5 minutes i was done. $19.99 minus the coupon so $17.99,a great deal! the guy working there was super nice and friendly and helpful. i highly recommend this place if you need a smog check."
2-star,0,"the individual working today made sexist, inappropriate comments about my appearance. otherwise, the experience was satisfactory. quick service."
5-star,1,extremely fast and friendly. couldn't imagine how the gentleman got the work done so quickly in the 119 degree heat. and only $19.99?! two thumbs up.
5-star,1,"service was excellent!! jim was the sweetest man. he did the smog, was efficient and quick with it, and still had time to throw some jokes at me. great experience, will definitely come back for my next smog check."
5-star,1,i came here at 8am to get a smog check and it's just a little shack like building on the corner. the process was quick and easy & if you check in on yelp you can save a few dollars. the guy who did the smog check was super nice and told me everything he was going to do before he did it (it's nice to know what's being done to your car) and because i didn't have change and didn't carry car he was helpful enough to grab me change from the bank.
5-star,1,"quick and easy. pulled up about 5pm on a tuesday afternoon. they accept competitors coupons before you have your smog and match the price. $1 fee for card use. i was also offered to stand in the small office in the ac, while i waited. a+ service and a+ price! look forward to using this company again next year!!"
5-star,1,"excellent experience. there was no line on a tuesday @11:15am. they take competitor's coupons as low as $13.99, which is what i had. the attendant was very pleasant and offered for me to wait in his air conditioned booth while he ran the test. in and out in less than 5 minutes. paid in cash so as to avoid the $1 charge for using a card. two thumbs up!"
5-star,1,"this was an excellent smog check experience, all seven minutes of it ! seriously, it couldn't have taken much longer than that, from the time i pulled up until i drove away. printed out the $17.99 coupon from the website and drove to this smogbusters location on a saturday afternoon. this location on rainbow just south of flamingo is one of the few locations that stays open until 6pm on saturdays instead of closing at 2pm. there was no wait, the tech was friendly and worked quickly - he printed out the certification and said the information would be transmitted to the dmv in about fifteen minutes, to be sure to wait that long for it to go through if i was going to one of the kiosks to renew the registration right away (i wasn't). gave him $20 in cash and didn't ask for change - it was great to be able to get this done so fast on a weekend and be treated so nicely. the smog check is good for 90 days and there are signs posted to remind customers to present the coupon before the check is started (otherwise it's $19.99 + tax)."
1-star,0,"people please do not waste your money on this place as it is the biggest rip-off in town. besides charging more than anyone else in town they have no respect for their customers. i am aware there are cheaper places to have my cars smog checked but i always go here because they are close to my house. they charge more, so there is never any waiting. i have taken my cars there for over 10 years and feel that would make me a good and loyal customer. i went there yesterday and my car did not pass the test, the man working there asked me if i recently had my battery changed, i said yes. he said until i put 50 miles on my new battery my car will not pass. fine, no problem except the test they did would be $13.99 and to get it retested it would only be $10. so now instead of paying $5 more it's going to be $10 more than everyone else in town. i asked if the extra $5 fee could be waived since i am a loyal customer, he said no. i asked if there was someone over him i could talk to. he gave me the number for a jim or bill, i can't remember because i was very upset. this guy whom is supposed to be professional was so rude i felt like i was talking to a high school drop-out punk. i asked him if he was really willing to lose a loyal customer who has brought in 2 cars every year for over 10 years over a $5 fee and he said ""yup"", not yes, just ""yup"" like a no class uneducated idiot. oh yes, i also said they should post a sign warning customers about if they had a new battery installed their car would not pass. the bully owner or manager replied ""we don't have to post any signs"". really snotty. i know they don't have to post a sign, but it would be a nice courtesy for the customer, but wait, then they wouldn't be able to rip off the customer. also if you use a credit card or debit card there is a $1 surcharge. this place cannot find enough ways to rip off the customers. i am disputing this charge with my credit card company, i so hope i win, not for the money, just the principle. i am not going back for my $10 retest, i would rather go elsewhere and drive a little farther and pay $15 then give them another penny of my money. whatever happened to don't pass don't pay."
5-star,1,great place to get your smog check done. i was there during lunch time. from start to finish it took 10 min. there is a coupon online from their website. make sure you present the coupon before the smog or they may not honor it. professional staff as well. i will go back there from now on.
5-star,1,"i couldn't be more satisfied with the friendly service vince offered me, and albert installed a brand new deck in my truck with apple carplay, and i haven't stopped playing with it since. anyone looking to upgrade their older system, or get a new alarm/starter installed, only needs to visit soundfx."
5-star,1,in the past 6 months i have had my 2013 street glide & my 2013 jeep sahara wrangler audio systems done by sound fx. the bike was just upgraded speakers & amp install. the jeep was a remote start/security & full audio system upgrade. everything was done absolutely perfect. i could not be happier with the install. the level of expertise professionalism & perfection was outstanding. everything was done in the exact amount of time & cost as was quoted. these guys have been around for years & it shows. they are laid back & easy to talk to & very knowledgeable. i would recommend anyone that is looking for a great sound system to check out sound fx whether you live in or out of the city. top notch. thanks guys!
5-star,1,"awesome service from people who really know and love cars and audio gear. i brought my classic in for an alarm and it was like getting plugged into the whole local community of classic car people. right away vince was suggesting locals who might have parts i needed (the only two i'd found so far were in ny and oregon), meets to check out, and even ideas for stereos they didn't carry but he'd be glad to do the install. so from the start, their hearts are totally in the right place. and we hadn't even talked about alarm systems. of course i wanted a couple special things with the installation, they figured out how to make it all work, the price was reasonable, and they were able to fit it in within a few days. i totally plan to be back and will be telling everyone about the quality of service at sound fx. simply the best."
5-star,1,"these guys are awesome! i wanted to get a jbl gt-basspro12 for my new suv and sent an email to harmon (the maker of jbl products) and they directed me to their distributor who pointed me to their authorized retailer - these guys - for what i wanted! i started off by emailing for information and found out that the sub i wanted wasn't something they normally carry but they could order it in for me (and it wouldn't take long for it to arrive). they also were more than helpful in giving me a full quote for not only the sub but installation (including wires and parts) via email. i called and pep (sorry if i spelled your name wrong) answered the phone and was very thorough and helpful in ordering what i wanted and booking me in for the installation. he also was very cognisant that i had a brand new car and wanted the installation to be as non invasive as possible (especially with the ""mounting"" of the sub in the hatchback). he even took the time to advise me the best methods of mounting without drilling before i even step foot in the shop. i arrived right on time and my car was promptly pulled into the work bay and the job was started. they've got a great shop to relax in while waiting - comfy chairs, big tv, washroom......and of course great sound if you want to hear music. the job was started and finished in the amount of time quoted and the price couldn't be beat. what made this such an awesome experience is the guys - this is a place owned by three guys and it is only these three guys that you will deal with from start to finish. they treat you like a friend and they treat your car like it is their own. one thing that really blew my mind is that pep actually took the time to check my presets on sirius to know what styles of music i preferred so that when he was setting the levels and testing everything out - he was doing it with the music that i would actually be listening to. he also took the time to carefully explain to me how to properly disconnect the wires so that if i wanted to remove the sub for any reason i would be able to....and he also made sure it was secured in the space without having to drill holes to hard mount it. i would definitely recommend these guys for any stereo work! i can definitely see why jbl is proud to refer them as authorised retailers in the gta!"
1-star,0,"vince gave me a quote with two items [$85] i didn't need if he checked my e-mail where i identified my car model and year,including the multi media,backup camera detail.this information would tell sound fx what they ought to be quoting. compared with another car audio store, the kenwood excelon pre tax pricing from sound fx was over $200 higher, especially since they wanted to install a mounting plate that already ships with the head unit i was going to buy,and the existing radio harness of the car could be used.if sound fx responded to my e-mail,i would tell them i am tossing the aftermarket hu that came with the car,thus if they needed to ""modify"" connectors,they could."
5-star,1,had a great car wash experience here. purchased the ultimate. got a prewash from a human & a dry down by a human. the neutral setting in this car wash was super easy. the neutral even takes you through the dryer at the appropriate speed which normally you have to drive slow through the dryer & i never know how slow to go. will definitely stop in again when i'm in the area.
1-star,0,"i am appalled at the unprofessionalism of the staff here. i have been coming here for a while and i usually fill up my gas tank and then do a quick clean up of my car at the ""free"" vacuums. i occasionally get the wash but not every time but i always get gas. today a sales rep comes out and when i decline the wash his ""friendly"" tone shifts and he says ""just a heads up lady these vacuums are for paying customers"" i inform him that although i did just pay for gas there is no sign stating that so he cannot legally decline use to anyone. he then goes inside and shuts off the vacuums!!!!"
1-star,0,"great location, but unfortunately this station is maintained poorly. four pumps are out of service. it is chaotic with everyone driving around into closed pumps."
1-star,0,"if you want to spend a long time getting gas, come here. i have been here twice recently and on both occasions, the machines didn't work - would not take my card and i had to go inside. inside, i stood in a line and was told it's probably the machines - ""they never work,"" said the disinterested clerk. so if you time to waste, you will love it here."
1-star,0,very disappointed in this gas station. we use this gas station regularly because it's close to home and they take the safeway gas rewards. went tonight and had saved up enough rewards for $1 off per gallon. the pump (#7) was so incredibly slow we pumped less than a gallon per minute. it's 104 outside and we had our baby in the car. my husband went inside to ask if we could transfer the rewards to another pump and the gas attendant was rude and said there was nothing she could do but we could stand inside with the baby until it was done pumping. she also said there was a work order on that pump because it hasn't been working (she claimed it doesn't work between 5 and 7pm because it's too sunny?!?!) yet they continue to let people waste their time using the pump. we finally decided to leave and forfeit the extra $15 savings. 20 minutes to pump 12 gallons is ridiculous!
1-star,0,"the car wash at this gas station has been hit and miss since it opened - i live close by and wanted this car wash to ""the one"". not convenient to drive up and deal with a machine to select car wash service and u end up having to open your car door to access & interface with machine anywys- oh and the convenience of receiving change back in dollar coins is zero! saturday i was at car wash and left a bag from high end store containing 3 plates and a book. the bag labeled with store name and receipt was in the bag as well. when parking my car to get it detailed after the drive thru car wash i threw my sunglasses, hair tie send loose change in the bag and saw one last time the merchandise wrapped up in the bag. i paid $28 for full car was with interior detail and tipped $12.00 and went to walmart. when i came back i gave additional $5 tip - not until later when i got home did i retrieve my bag and the plates were missing. the plates i bought and left in the bag in back seat of the car were stolen. i will never return again and will be posting this on other sites. i don't know who stole the plates out of my car - the males doing the detail work? the person who solicits to fix a crack in your windshield? this is not good business and everyone should know this car wash/gas station is to be avoided. the bigger mexican gentlemen always helpful - and he wasn't there when merchandise was stolen out of my car. it is worth mentioning that when i walked back to fetch my car an employee of the gas station was still inside my car wiping it down - my car was never off to the side parked where someone could have access to contents of my car - my car was parked the entire time where the interior cleaning parking is. so who ever stole my plates worked for the fast station."
1-star,0,wanted to support local business so had my windshield replaced last january. they promised a $25 gas gift card along with it. i never received it. a few months went by and i called about it. the woman i spoke to was very friendly and said she would see to it that it got sent. i am still waiting. it has been a year now and still no gas card that they promised.
5-star,1,"two nights ago i had a late night at the casino. on my way home i stopped to get something to drink. i used my visa card that required that i insert the chip. being tired at this point i walked away with my purchase and left the card behind. i did not realize for about two days. i rarely use that particular card so i did discover it missing till then. today after tearing my truck and home apart i decided it must be at the last place i used it. i looked up the number, called and was greeted by rob. he confirmed the card had been placed safely under the counter awaiting my return. now about the people who find fault with this crew, these people complain about everything. it's unfair that these people pass judgement based on one little thing. i visit this station about twice a week and will continue to especially because of this situation and the utmost professionalism shown here. thanks again robert."
1-star,0,"annoying, arguementive, and extremely rude windshield replacement sales people. even after saying no thank you several times and explaining that i already had arrangements to have the repair. not at all how i want to start my morning. basically arguing with a rude stranger. i will not return and i have payed off and closed my chevron gas credit card."
5-star,1,i get my car washed here sometimes and it's really hit or miss depending on who washes your car. sometimes i feel like the guys washing my car don't really care and are kind of doing a half assed job. however! jerry washed my car and he did an awesome job. he really put effort into washing my car and he was very nice. i hope he is there next time i get my car washed! everyone is very very nice! :)
3-star,0,"good place to get cheap gas, it's literally right next to an indian reservation. location well lit. they even try to promote their business by having you log onto your facebook and like their page."
5-star,1,"in the world of gas station foods, it is usually a sin to eat anything from ""the kitchen"", but stayshons is the exception! they make excellent burritos in house!... the chorizo egg and cheese burritos are always fresh and tasty; never greasy or soggy. they also make red and green chile burritos whith some actual spice! for $4.50, it can't be beat!"
1-star,0,"my wife was just verbally assaulted by the sad excuse for a human being that was running the cig area, heather. maybe she had a bad day. maybe she's sick of her pathetic life and likes to take it out on customers. even the other manager agreed she is terrible. if that's the case, why is she still there? i'd give stayshon's 5 stars if it wasn't for this sick individual. everyone else gets two thumbs up for their customer interaction skills."
5-star,1,this place is always poppin' off since it's practically the only gas station for miles it seems. it also has a smoke shop to get your smokes at low rez prices so that's prolly the reason too. i come here only for the coke freestyle when i need a fizzy lifting drink. the workers are usually friendly and fast - prices are fair and that's all i would ask of them.
1-star,0,"i was a longtime customer but i'm done with this place and the awful customer service. despite a few gems like jerry the window guy and the nice girl working the food area most days the staff is rude and clueless about how to treat customers. i've purchased countless fill-ups and car washes, car window tinting and used their window repair service 3 times. i used to go in 4-5 times a week for a 44 oz. drink. the final straw was when after i first paid for the drink (i pre-paid because no one was at the register when i walked in and the line is usually 6-8 people deep) i filled my cup only to find there were no lids that size. i asked one of the cashiers if they had more lids, he said they ran out. holding the full lid-less cup i asked if i could pour them in two 32 oz. cups so i can drink them in the car. he said that would be 50 cents more. i said ""but i already paid for the larger size and you're out of big lids"" - he snapped ""that's not my problem and that doesn't mean you can get free stuff"". his tone and attitude was horrible. if this was an isolated incident it would be very forgettable - but this is the kind of service you get there constantly."
1-star,0,"i was approached by erin at this gas station to have my windshield repaired. i let them call my insurance company and set up an appointment with me to fix my windshield (between 8 and 12). i waited--no show, no call. i called them and the woman who answered couldn't find my paperwork, so she said she would call me back. guess what. no call back after about an hour. i called again and she said, ""what? they didn't call you?"" after i had already spent four hours of my day waiting on these people! no thanks. i will not be returning to this station and will never do business with them again. their gas is way overpriced, too."
5-star,1,"awesome local gas station that's open 24/7 with friendly cashiers who treat me like the regular i am, their mini mart is always stocked with goodies and they always have a sale on sodas/water/energy drink at crazy prices, i stop in just to get drinks sometimes, another note is they do not serve alcohol incase you're looking for a quick stop, but the just opened a car wash with great hand dry service still sun down"
2-star,0,"i usually go to this location because it's convenient to my home, but the last 2 times i've been there it's been very bad experience, super slow pumps, and to top it off 2 stations closed, someone else that was also having the same issue commented to me that it's their fuel pump filters that are dirty/clogged... that can't be good for our vehicles. anyways hope they read this and do something about it"
1-star,0,"great gas, plenty of snacks, convenient location...what's wrong ya say? simple, the customer service has gone downhill in the last year or so. no greet, no acknowledgment, the most recent cashier was again indifferent (almost unfriendly during slow business) and no receipt...when did not giving an option for a receipt and not counting change (debit transaction and later a large bill transaction) for the customer become the norm. are my expectations a business faux pas? best to spend my moolah elsewhere...tired of the attitudes. peace."
1-star,0,just had the worst experience at this station. the lady behind the counter had the worst sense of customer service i've ever seen. i accidentally hit the debit card button instead of credit. when i told her that i made a mistake she just looked at me. i repeated my error and she barked that i needed to hit cancel. i explained to her that it's not my job to know how this works. she then gave me attitude about being on my phone. it's not your job to counsel me on etiquette. in any case i walked out of there choosing to spend my money elsewhere.
5-star,1,"my wife and i really enjoyed our experience at subaru concord. don't let the appearance turn you away while they are remodeling! caleb was the best sales person i have ever dealt with when buying a car. (seriously ask for caleb!)he was very knowledgeable about the 2 vehicles we tested while being polite and not pushy at all. both caleb and shaun (the sales manager) listened to our needs and got us where we needed to be money wise, all while being ""real"" people and not just shady trickster sales people. we got my wife into a 2018 subaru impreza sport and she absolutely loves it! a huge thank you the team at subaru concord! go check them out!"
5-star,1,"i had a great experience at subaru concord. my salesman, todd, was a pleasure to work with. he was thorough and fair throughout the whole process. it's rare for me to be in a dealership and not feel intimidated. i will be referring todd and subaru concord to anyone i can. thanks guys!"
2-star,0,"internet sales person quoted a great out-the-door price (via email), but when we agreed to purchase, they suddenly added several hundred dollars back on to the price. talking with manager joe powers revealed that it was a ""business decision"" not to honor the price ($500 difference) because he could ""easily sell the car"" for more. the dealership admitted their mistake when quoting the otd price, but was not willing to correct. they were also disparaging another dealership who was competing for our purchase (tindol subaru, who seems to have an excellent reputation by all accounts). overall, it was a disappointing/ time wasting experience with subaru concord. maybe this was unusual, but be warned. get everything in writing."
5-star,1,always a good experience! just bought my 2nd crosstrek in 2 1/2 years from the same dealership. the sales process was easy again. service department is top notch.
1-star,0,"i walked onto the lot a few months ago looking for a used outback. the salesman was good, i was enjoying the experience, we went inside to talk price. after talking for a bit we settled on a price, i told him i would think it over, and left. i got online and the price ""they couldn't go any lower on"" was significantly higher than the asking price online. needless to say i was frustrated. i walked away and didn't think anything else of them. until a month or two later i saw my credit score had been dinged for a hard pull on my credit. the salesman had explicitly told me he was doing a soft pull and would not do a hard pull. shame on you. good day."
1-star,0,"from my perspective, i would never go back to this place again. two months and only 950 miles into the purchase of a used vehicle, i have had brake issues and a sensor go bad ($260 quote to replace a $35 part). this is the 5th used vehicle my wife and i have purchased in a 10 year period so i understand the as-is policy. but i've also dealt with dealerships that wanted to keep their customers happy and this place is not on that list. also, their finance guy misspelled my name on the initial credit report request so now i'm getting mail from our finance company with the wrong name but my social security number. i even received something from equifax with the wrong name and my ss#. i'm wondering what issues i'll have in the future. we even walked out of the buying process because we were told that the financing was the way we wanted but when it came time to signing the papers, it was more than we told them we wanted to pay. they just made me feel like i should have waited and taken my business to another dealer. their sales manager did what it took to make the sale but beyond that, they didn't do what it took to make me ever come back. unless they just have the car that you've been looking for and you can't find it anywhere else, avoid this place."
5-star,1,"my husband and i drove by the sub dealer and saw a cute lil bug with the top down sitting out front, so we stopped. we were promptly greeted by jennifer yet that ""salesman trying to hassle you and sell you something"" demeanor was not there - which was appreciated! jennifer was friendly and fun, we cracked up several times, she's definitely got that sister presence about her. while she's fairly young and possibly new to ""selling"" cars she was very insightful and willing to help and learn new things with us - she was a pleasant lady to work with. while i was in the market to purchase a car that day i wanted to go to other dealerships to see what they had to offer, when advising jennifer of that she was very understanding and not at all pushy (again very un-salesman like-loved it)! needless to say the general manager jeff ross then came out and greeted us, he too was very nice and made our quick stop at the dealership a wonderful experience. so we left and went over to the honda dealership - they had about 50 guys standing around doing nothing, yet they were to ""busy"" to even give us a wave hello. finally someone did show up and it was nothing but ""i don't know's"" and pushing cars on us that we didn't even find interesting - we left quickly. then of course we went to the big boy of hendricks (where i purchased a previous vehicle in atlanta) - the crap they tried to pawn off on us was horrible!!! i had high hopes for hendricks since i had purchased my atlanta car, my husband purchased a brand new car from them ... never returning. so we call jennifer back and start the ball rolling - less than 2 hours later i was driving a wonderful car! yes it was used, but it was low in miles & a fantastic price! when visiting other dealers and informing them what i had found at subaru they flat out said ""you didn't buy it??"" - if that's not a sign i don't know what is! jennifer was a breath of fresh air when it came to the nightmare of buying a car. now that my husband and son are in the market for new cars there is no other place i'd go but to jennifer harrington #858-231-0407 at subaru of concord!! best buying experince ever!!!"
2-star,0,"i bought a new forrester at this dealership, and the sales process was about what you would expect. my experience with the sales side of the business was flawless. for sales, i'd rate them 5 stars. for service, however, they rate no stars. i took it in for the 7,500 mile service, and had to wait nearly three hours. i'm pretty sure this was a basic inspection and an oil change. quite a wait when you have an appointment. no efforts were made to let us know what was taking so long, i had to hunt down the service manager to ask. when making the appointment, i was told this would take less than an hour. recently, at just over 10,000 miles the check engine light came on. i took my vehicle in, and finally after two hours was told it was fine, but the ecm needed updated to change some thresholds. that was monday. today, the light has came back on again. obviously they didn't fix it. the service department here is totally incompetent and could care less about you or your vehicle. do yourself a favor and don't go here. update: i've since been having my forrester serviced at the subaru dealership in mooresville. it's a much better experience, and i highly recommend them."
5-star,1,"kevin c, he has never steered us wrong. we followed him from serpentini, to bigelow, to matia, to now sunnyside. i cannot say enough great things about him. he found what we were looking for each time and a price that was excellent. he follows up with you and makes sure that everything is going good. he is a fantastic salesman as well as a fantastic person. the dealership itself is clean and welcoming. they have a new car showroom and a used car showroom. the used car building needs some work as it is off-putting, but the new car showroom is newer and comfortable. they have free cookies and coffee! i think we may be up to double digits with the number of cars we bought from kevin in the last ten years between the five people in my family but he serves well and i bought two cars between the sale of two with kevin. i got a chevy camaro across the street at nick abraham and i cannot recommend that location and a hummer h2 from central cadillac avoid that place like it has flesh eating oogaloboogalies. i like sunnyside and kevin is our guy so i say give it a try! they have cookies and coffee"
1-star,0,a complete wast of time. showed me a car. gave me a price. go to make the deal a day later. the car is gone. a total bait & switch
1-star,0,"took 4+ hours to purchase a used car i'd already put a deposit on and didn't even negotiate the price of. the last hour being the hard sell on nonsense dealer mark-up items like wheel/tire coverage and extended vehicle warranties. post sale customer support is poor to very poor and to wrap it all up they've been leaving me harassing voice-mails about ""documentation the bank needs"" when upon calling the bank myself they have no knowledge of this and even helped me file complaint with their customer service team against the dealership for harassment. stay away from this mess."
5-star,1,we broke down on the turnpike. we limped here. they got us right in and fixed the problem!!! very friendly and accommodating. just super service!!!
5-star,1,"we drove to sunnyside chevy from our house in richfield on monday to pick up our son's first new car, after first working out the deal with matt smolik over the phone and by email. let me tell you, the drive was well worth it...and matt and his team have some new loyal customers for life. having been to a different dealership a few weeks before, we were pretty frustrated with the car-buying process, not to mention disgusted by the lack of professionalism at that dealership. the atmosphere at sunnyside was totally professional and laid-back. there was no pressure and it was a very comfortable and easy buying experience. kevin chojnacki was pleasant and fun to deal with, as was the finance manager, dave samples. keep up the good work-- and keep all the good people you have at the dealership. it is so true that the people are really what makes a business successful!"
5-star,1,"my van needed work on the radiator and belts replaced. my usual auto technician had retired so i decided to try to & m, which had been recommended by a co-worker. even though it was across town from home, it was worth the trip! the staff was very professional and nice. they diagnosed the problem, checked everything out, and kept me apprised of the status the entire time. it took a couple of days to complete the work but it runs like a charm now. i will be bringing my vehicles here going forward. and i will let all my friends know about the great service and quality of work. plus the price was very reasonable!"
5-star,1,"fantastic work done on my honda civic. i went in for a transmission fluid change, they took care of me fast and paid a super reasonable price. highly recommended."
5-star,1,honest and outstanding service. got a call from them the day after i picked up my vehicle to let me know they overcharged me. who does that? t&m that's who! i will never take my cars to anyone else but t&m.
5-star,1,"we followed others' advice re t & m. a+ service. fair price & efficient, same day service. guys professional, yet very affable. highly recommend to others. this will be our auto service center of choice from now on. thanks gents. john & evanna"
5-star,1,"these guys are the best! saved us so much money and they were friendly, professional and my suv runs great! highly recommended!!"
5-star,1,"i was referred by 4wheel parts to this place to have my obd2 port fixed since both nissan dealership couldn't help in anyway with my situation. in under 2 hours i was out and running and the price is reasonably low even with my situation. special thanks to nick for the unforgettable customer service and honest repair. thank you so much t&m automotive for your sincere service. i do highly recommend this place for all your automotive needs. i will definitely be back for future business since it's so hard now a days to find a reliable honest place to have your car fixed. once again, thank you so much."
5-star,1,"i took my vehicle in yesterday morning without an appointment as i had issues with my car over the weekend. nick took my vehicle and was very helpful right from the beginning. i requested them to look at other issues i was having with my car, and they were very honest. i got my car back the same day and it was very reasonable for what needed to be done. t&m automotive was recommended to me by a friend, and i would highly recommend them to anyone who needs an honest mechanic!"
5-star,1,"top notch and honest service! had an issue with my wife's car, followed a few instructions from nick and it worked. saved me $600+. best place in town."
5-star,1,"i work right across the street from t&m . each one of these guys are awesome and honest. even if it was an answer i didn't like, i always got the real. very very helpful and always a direct answer. number #1 in my book! thanks guys!"
5-star,1,went for a check few months ago they were honest.diagnosed the problem. he didnt have attitude was really helpful explaining the general stuff. u know how it is when they see a woman like wolf seeing a helpless sheep.. lol
5-star,1,"great shop, very honest to what needs to be done. i had new orielly's motor mounts but i still had bad vibration and thought it might be something else wrong with the engine. they checked it out and said that the new motor mounts from orielly's were bad and needed to put factory ones in. had it done and was a world of difference."
5-star,1,"i've been using t&m automotive for years and they are great. honestly the best shop that i've ever dealt with. honest, great work and reasonably priced. i will always come back to these guys."
5-star,1,"the best auto repair shop in las vegas hands down. do not go anywhere else. nick, bruce and the crew are the best and most honest people you will find in las vegas. the quality of their repairs and promptness is what makes them so incomparable to other shops."
5-star,1,"while visiting las vegas during the summer, we ran into an issue with our brakes. our front pads and rotors needed to be changed out. being an out of towner, and not knowing where to go, i drove to 4 or 5 different mechanics in the las vegas area, and none of them impressed me like t & m did!! this place was clean!! bathrooms were immaculate, staff knowledgeable, and worked with me on cost, and the only reason i had to wait awhile was because i was a walk-in, and didn't have an appointment. part of me wanted to just have my car serviced by them every time i come to vegas! honest businesses, and great service. ..found them from a referral from another mechanic who didn't service my make of vehicle. ...what good fortune i had!!"
5-star,1,"we have been taking our vehicles to t & m automotive for years (since they were on silverado ranch). nick & bruce in the front office are very helpful with scheduling and explaining the scope of work and associated costs; and nick's dad tracy and the rest of the guys in the shop have always done great work for us. i find it refreshing that when the dealership tries to scare you into doing thousands of dollars of work (when you're only trying to get an oil change); t & m will fully assess the vehicle and let you know what/if necessary repairs are needed, are they are always less that what the dealership said. in my experience, t & m's cost has always been waaaay better as well. unlike the dealership, labor costs are not astronomical. to date, we've had the brakes done on three vehicles; cv boots replaced; an a/c blend door actuator fixed; a faulty window motor replaced; a broken axle fixed (damn curbs jump out of nowhere!); an exhaust manifold w/ catalytic converter replaced; plus a handful of other services over the years. this trip was to deal with a water pump that's leak was causing a chirping sound. i dropped the truck off at about 9 am, and got a call from bruce about two hours later advising that they needed to replace the thermostat and water pump for $650. i got a call at about 1 pm that the truck was done and that the total was $637 with tax. picked up the vehicle at lunch and it was good as new! i have referred a number of friends and family, who have also had good experiences at t & m. we will use them whenever necessary (although, hopefully it's not very often)!"
5-star,1,"most trusted place to have your car sreviced, no bull. they never try to sell you anything you don't need. i've been coming here for years and always happy with the service. everyone is nice and courteous. not the cheapest place around, but honesty and trust is worth a ton to me!"
5-star,1,"came to visit my friend and decide to take care of my brakes on my truck. i was recommended to come here. seems that all the customers have been coming here for years. i spoke to another customer and they had also been coming here for years! i felt the price for my brakes was appropriate. these guys are honest and friendly... super nice and trust worthy, i'm from california and will bring my truck back here again!!! ty!"
5-star,1,"my family has been going to t&m for over 5 years. they are honest, friendly and caring. i wont take my cars anywhere else! they are the best in nevada! i highly reccomend them to anyone and everyone!"
5-star,1,"it is pretty difficult to judge an automotive center when you simply know nothing about cars. its also pretty difficult to trust an automotive center when you know nothing about cars. i recently discovered the smell of gas in and around my car. my dad suggestion going to see nick at t&m because he had been going to nick for years and nick would surely take care of me and make my car safe for my 16 month old daughter to be in. t&m took my car without an appointment and called me within 3 hours to let me know what was wrong, how much it was going to cost and what time the car would be done. not only did they stick to their word and followed through with everything they said, they removed the dead rodent that apparently crawled up into my car and died....causing the smell. yes, a dead rodent was causing that smell. gross. i know that i can always rely on t&m to be on time, be reasonably priced, remove rodents and more importantly...be a automative center that people can trust. i highly recommend t&m."
5-star,1,"my family has been coming to t&m for years and we love them. they are honest which is a rarity for auto repair shops. t&m doesn't try to scam you. that is the reason why we came to them in the first place because the original place my mom went to for her van kept doing shady things. t&m employees are super friendly and they work with you. i remember sitting in the lobby waiting as they were fixing the van and someone who worked nearby came in wanting an oil change. he gave them the key and asked if they can drive it to t&m because he didn't have enough time to do it. they said yes! now that's some customer service. they don't work on european cars which is why i can't take my new car here, but they will always be our family auto repair shop. my mom can't stop raving about them and neither can i."
5-star,1,"if you want a reliable, trustworthy mechanics, look no further, i have been sending friends and family to tracy, nick, and guys for almost 20 years, i have always had great reviews from everyone i have referred! they are 5 stars in my book!!"
5-star,1,"these guys are awesome! as i sit and wait for my truck to have work done i'm amazed on how friendly and efficient they are. they explained everything for the work that needed to be done. if you need work done come here you won't be disappointed. they have good prices and don't push anything on you. this is what automotive repairs are suppose to be like. i call it a car hospital. need check up or surgery these guys are the doctor your looking for. i've got better service for my car than i've got for my personal doctor. maybe i need to find a good family run doctored office who take the time to analyze the problems with fast service. they even offered to take a lady to town square to shop while she waited, that's awesome in my eyes. these guys are the real deal. they even squeezed me in when they were busy after a three day weekend. nice job!"
5-star,1,"using t&m for about 6 years with my 4 vehicles. it's so hard to find a mechanic you can trust and nick earned my trust years ago. these guys are clearly interested in long term relationships, not just trying to get you for what they can at the moment."
5-star,1,"best car repair shop ever!! phenominal!!!!!! neither i nor any of my family members have ever been more impressed with a car shop than we were with t & m. i was in a minor accident and one of my wheels was bent in at almost a 90 degree angle. i had it towed to the closest shop at the time which was t & m. the shop was on the other side of town from where i lived which made me nervous at first. however, my repairs came in more than $300 under what they quoted me and $500 under what i was quoted by any other shop. they even checked the car out at first for free. repairs were done within a couple days. my car is now actually running several times better than it was before the accident! i am incredibly pleased and overjoyed with the repairs. i recommend them to anyone who needs work done on their vehicle.i will be taking my car and my family's cars there for anything i need regardless how far it is. i wish i could give them more than 5 stars."
5-star,1,bruce and nick were super friendly! the pricing is reasonable and the work is outstanding. any place that has great customer service is a winner in my book!!
4-star,1,"some of the things that make this place so great are also what make it fall short of a 5 star rating. t & m is a place that i know won't upsell me with services i don't need. the prices aren't rock bottom, but the pricing is fair. i'd rather have fair pricing on services i'm confident i need rather than rock bottom pricing on services i didn't need in the first place. because of this honesty, it's not a surprise that this shop is very busy. however, a busy shop means that it's hard to get work done here unless you have a flexible schedule. at the place i get my brakes and belts changed, i can drop in during lunch, get my work done, then be out in about an hour. that would be impossible at t & m because they're too busy. i live alone, so i can't just drop off my car in the morning and go the whole day without a car. furthermore, t & m is only open m-f, which i hate since i work m-f. if you're like many vegas residents and work varied schedules, you can afford to wait at the shop on a random weekday that you're not working. i don't have that luxury. for larger repairs, i won't go anywhere else. my motor mounts got fixed the last time i was at t & m and they did a great job. though, because it's inconvenient, i don't bother using t & m for small things. it isn't worth the hassle."
5-star,1,"really like these mechanics! they don't find random stuff wrong with my car when i just went in for an oil change. been coming here ever since aaa recommended them to me! i've read other yelp reviews and because they are so busy, they don't have time to upsale you or waste your time/money."
5-star,1,"i have been dealing with t&m since 2000 when nick & tracey had their own places and then when they combined as a father & son team. they are the best auto repair service in las vegas. not only is their diagnosis & repairs excellent, but they are exceptionally honest and they back up their work. do not go to a dealer unless it is free under warranty! only suggestions might be a shuttle service & more waiting options."
5-star,1,"i broke down on the freeway just south of las vegas and was towed to t &m. nick was great, he let me keep the car there for a week while i fussed with aaa trying to get my car towed to southern california where i live. i would have no qualms about letting t&m fix the car except i live 300 miles away. anyway, nick thanks very much, i appreciate the help and i will recommend you folks to anyone who needs a good mechanic with a heart... tjs, laguna niguel, ca."
4-star,1,"ok.. so i went to walmart yesterday to get an oil change. the mechanic told me that there was something wrong with the battery, therefore, i had to pay for a new battery. $79.99 for new battery with a $9.00 reimbursement because they would dispose the old battery for me. then as i am waiting for my car, the mechanic comes and tells me that when they put the new battery in and hooked everything back up, the starter fried as they were testing to make all was working. so i had to call the insurance to have the car towed. i had originally said that i would go to pep boys.... wrong idea after calling the fam to let them know what was going on. grandma told me that pep boys was the worst place to go. so i called the dispatcher of the tow truck company and they told me that i had to go thru the insurance because they only want to deal with the primary caller. so, then i had to call the insurance to have them call the dispatcher to change the destination of the where my car was being towed to. i had the tow truck company deliver my car to t&m automotive because they had dealt with other cars that we had for the fam in the past. they are really good. even though they are little pricey with the cost to fix, i rather pay the cost because they are aaa approved auto repair, ase certified, plus they deal with the dmv directly such as smog checks and other things. they treated us very well in the past. when i went in yesterday with my car, almost closing time, majority of the dudes working that were working there are still there. thanks, t&m!!!"
1-star,0,"i wish i could leave these people zero stars. they are crooks, plain and simple. i admit that i parked illegally, but they refused to bring my car back, and said it was being held at their lot.. which was 6.5 miles away. and of course their driver refused to drive me to the lot. the tow fee was skyhigh robbery. the guy on the phone hung on me, the employees were rude and mocked me while i stood in their showroom demanding to get my car back. even after i paid them they said that my car was off-site and left me waiting. they wouldn't even get my car without me giving them the key. i feel like the only way they stay in business is towing unsuspecting people. i'm sure they make a killing with this racket. it looks like i'm just one review in a long list of bad reviews for this place. i would recommend steering far away from them at all costs. it's one thing to tow an illegally parked car, but it's something else to be complete pricks after the fact. way to be professional guys."
1-star,0,"the person who answers the phone to the wannabe business talks bad to customers. 3 different people called on my behalf when my vehicle was towed in a bp lot while i was purchasing something. the white trash redneck towing my car said if he sees me in the neighborhood again he will tow my vehicle cause ""he can"" and the owner/loser answering the phone told my brother to suck his dick and laughed at me and thanked me for the money. i think it's funny that he believes this is a fun little game. hahah, this should be fun! it won't stop here."
1-star,0,"i admit that i parked illegally downtown in a what i thought was a cvs parking lot. the parking was entirely my fault as i didn't see the ""do not park"" sign in the snow and dark conditions. i admitted defeat and called the number on the sign and was directed to this towing company. we had to get an uber to a location that was 30 minutes away from where i was parked. i begrudgingly held out my card to pay the $250 fee to be told it was cash only. i didn't have cash on me. they then offered to ""drive me to an atm"" in an old, filthy car. as a small female at after dark this situation immediately had me on alert for my safety. my car was not visible at this time. i asked to see the car because i was unsure if this business was legitimate. there were around eight men in an office who were all standing laughing at me and my question. the owner came out and told me in a threatening manner he would ""kiss my ass twice"". they then asked for the keys to my car to show me that they actually had it. so now they wanted $250 cash and the keys to my car. i was very frightened as these men were some real shady characters. it was clear they were consuming alcohol as there were cocktails laying around. this place looks more like a money laundering front than any kind of car sales and towing business. i'm extremely happy my boyfriend was with me and would caution anyone calling these people for a tow. i will be filing a report to bbb due to this threatening and unprofessional experience."
1-star,0,do not agree to be towed by these predators after an accident. you will be sorry if you do. $300 tow. $50 admin. $50 cleaning? and $75 a day storage. getting an estimate while the meter was running on the storage took almost a week. completely unscrupulous and unnecessarily vile when talking to them.
1-star,0,"left me waiting an hour and a half in the summer heat and kept telling me they'd be there momentarily. when they finally arrived, they basically told me i should just be lucky they came. incredibly rude and unprofessional."
1-star,0,stay away from this business at any all cost! one of the shadiest body shops i've ever dealt with. they do not fix things correctly and take way too long. also cash only which is ludacris.
1-star,0,"complete con artists. they hold your vehicle hostage, are rude, vile and disgusting people. they've been on the news. i'm sure everything they do is ""legal"", but that's hell of a way to make a living."
1-star,0,"i made a yelp profile just to warn others. this company is awful. my car got towed (the visitor tag fell on the floor of the car and was not visible. it's bad luck on my part, but accept that it wasn't visible and so got towed). the man on the line, brian, said someone would be out in an hour to come and release my vehicle. 3 hours later a driver showed up. i called repeatedly to find out what was going on and i was hung up on and my calls were ignored. he eventually stopped answering and just text messaged me. the worst part is that when the driver, sam, finally got there to release my car, he told me no one called him to tell them i was waiting. i have already filed complaints to the attorney general office. stay away!"
1-star,0,my husband nearly severed his foot in a motorcycle accident. in the chaos of everything we consented to the first crooked tow company that came along (tag). they had the bike for 2 days and 4 hours. ready for this? $763 to get a totaled motorcycle out. there needs to be a special place in hell for these tow companies that take advantage of compromised people.
1-star,0,"pray that this company never tows your vehicle. i had to borrow my father's car while mine was being inspected. parked his car in my apartment complex parking lot after 11pm at night. woke up and went out to the car to leave for work the next morning and my car was gone. they go out looking for people to tow in the residences of south hills. i wish i knew that. then my father goes to pay the $220 to get his car out, and they say they are unable to take a credit card! what towing company isn't able to take a credit card? i am reporting this company to the bbb. they are rude and don't care what they have to do to make a buck. i've heard from a reputable source that they are a bunch of drug addicts too! stay away from these crooks! they are nasty people that i pray i never have to deal with again!"
1-star,0,"i deleted my last review because it was a little personal and very long-- ill just keep this short and sweet. stay away from this company! i dropped my car off for an inspection and they did $300 in work without my permission and wouldn't give my car back until i paid even though i didnt ask them to do the work. i asked about an estimate on back brakes since i figured they would fail.. instead they did my front brake pads & charged me $125. over half the people on this planet know how to change front brake pads.. i could've gotten this done for free by 10+ people. (plus they didnt need done! the back ones did) they also replaced 3 lights when only one was out. finally, they replaced my wipers even though my other ones were new (30 days old) and i had the receipt. none of this mattered and i was still ordered to pay $300 on unauthorized work. tag had his mechanics handle the dirty work of extorting me and keeping my car since i didnt have the $300. if you wanna play russian roulette, drop off your car here for inspection but expect them to do hundreds of dollars in work without your permission then hold your car hostage."
1-star,0,terrible service! wouldn't take my card and had to go see cashier. pump wouldn't work and no one could figure out or help as i stand out in the cold for 10 minutes and go inside twice! crap and more crap!! all i want is to go home from a hard day of work and this is what i get! will definitely warn all my family and friends of this location!!!!!!!!
1-star,0,"worst car wash i've ever gotten. do not waste your money. i had to turn around because they left the ashtray full of ashes & trash, middle console sticky & still trash on the floor, still dirt spots on the outside. i called to talk to the manager & he didn't even care."
1-star,0,"yeah, went to get most expensive exterior wash, and had $2 coupon on my phone when the attendant informed me the could not take the coupon from the phone, it must be printed! welcome back to 2001 at this place. obviously owned and staffed by luddites. pathetic at best!"
1-star,0,nice staff... good ppl. i let them know that i had vomit in my car and they didn't mention they are not equipped to clean the vomit. after i paid $30 for my car they could not clean the main reason i had come to them. they did not even over a refund.
1-star,0,zero stars if i could rate it that way. the man at the front counter was unbelievably rude and unprofessional. he was sarcastic and walked away and would not check me out. i called the manager to tell him what happened and it didn't seem like it really shocked him. i will not return here again. terrible customer service..go to the gas station down the road.
1-star,0,worst car wash ever. water spots all over the hood. crap still on front windshield and the they forgot to vacuum the front passenger area!!! at least i assume they forgot it or did a piss poor job. won't ever go there again.
2-star,0,"i do not care how convenient this place is to my home, there is simply no excuse for them to charge 10 cents more per gallon than anywhere else on charleston rd. when they cannot even keep the floors of their store clean, nor their lot free of vagrants begging for change."
2-star,0,1 star for me actually going to a different gas station and 1 star for the cheaper gas at this station versus the one by my house. otherwise- yuck! this place is dirty dirty dirty. i reached down to grab the gas pump handle and my hand almost got stuck to it because it was so sticky and gross. i know this is a gas station and those pump handles are gonna be dirty but i shouldn't have to bring gloves with me to get gas. the trash was also overflowing at the pump. it looked like they never come outside and clean up. maybe it was too hot for them. =) i did not go inside and thank god. i can only imagine what that looked like. they should have a clean outside and it will be more inviting for people to go in and get other things. they are definitely losing money because of this who knows? i may have went in and bought something if it was cleaner.
2-star,0,"store and gas island are dirty. the first pump that i went to wasn't working with credit or debit cards. the store is not maintained very well, which is apparent with the dirty condition and the pumps not working"
3-star,0,"i like this location. it has plenty of room for parking and pumping gas. it is located in a shopping center that has a lot of good options from hardware to food to nails so very convenient to get gas or a snack while passing through. the store is clean inside and out. i always see someone sweeping the parking lot. staff inside is friendly. i haven't used the restrooms before. all in all, your typical, but clean and spacious convenient store. don't know what the obsession is with the amount of terrible's so close together on charleston is, but it's a heck of a lot cleaner than the one near del taco!"
1-star,0,do they ever have fully working pumps? at all times they have at least 2-3 pumps that are out of service when i come here. this makes maneuvering around trying to wait for a free pump a total pain in the ass especially when your dealing with other customers that are so oblivious to their surroundings. this is the last time i'll ever give this location a chance. a total waste of time and not worth the headache.
1-star,0,"the name fit the store ""terrible"", super high on gas and store items. next time, i'll push it a mile to the next gas stations."
1-star,0,"book was judged. well john, here i go. i originally came her with my wife to grab a drink and snack before church. there was 2 people ahead of us in the check out line. no problems, wait wasn't serious. the young black lady that was at the counter was having problems with her ebt card, and was trying to figure it out. (young black girl). no biggie, hey its sunday, god's day. poor lady asked the cashier if she could pay cash, but here was john, putting the young lady's groceries to the side. bad enough she was having a problem with her card and felt embarrassed, but here comes the store manager, making her feel even worse. as if she was going to grab the groceries and run. mind you there is another register, 2 feet away, and he chose to sideline her refusing to help her, while she had her wallet open to pay cash. during this, he is calling for the next person to come to the register. she's still standing there! trying to pay! the other register is closed. if customer waiting is his concern, then open it up. we put down our things and walked out. just can not stand dirty inconsiderate douches. a store manager at that, treating customers with no respect. she was livid, explaining how he made her felt, but he looked over her as if she was not there. we have a mercedes route that goes through here during test driving. i'm sure i now can have the team eliminate gassing up here, which is more than $1000 a day worth in money they could have had, all because of this one experience. prayed for you today john. hope you treat your future customers better in the future."
2-star,0,i stopped by to use their air machine which is over priced at $1.50. then it actually deflates my tires because it doesn't work properly! luckily a tire shop down the street helped me. the gentleman there said he gets people all day - every day who stop by because of that broken machine. the location is congested with traffic and their prices are too high for gas anyway. i won't return.
1-star,0,"for the first i've ever noticed, i think i was just cheated on gasoline! i was near empty, and just got a fill up here where 20.5 gallons were poured. generally near empty, the max i've ever seen is 18 - 18.2, because there's reserves. i just looked it up, and i have a 20 gallon tank in my vehicle after reserves are taken into account. there's definitely something off here. the machines need to be calibrated properly. otherwise, it seems fine. kind of dingy for a terrible's location. i also wouldn't use their car wash. it's the ""touchy"" kind that gives your car a million little scrapes, ruining the paint job, especially apparent if you have a dark car. if they fix their thieving ways, i'd give 'em 3 to 3.5 stars. for more, they'd need a serious cleaning and update."
2-star,0,"i arrived here because i exclusively only use chevron. it's in a convenient location because i use decatur a lot. it's small, there's a machine car wash service in rear. not as many gas pumps to use as other chevron stations. no special price on gas today, there's times when they run a promotion if you use your chevron card, usually 5 cents cheaper than the average rate in town. i'd probably only use this when i'm in the area. it is appealing to see across the street the new winchell's that opened up. does that summarize what i was paying attention to? ;)"
5-star,1,friendly service. right price. i needed 4 new tires and from walking in the door to driving away it was around 30 minutes. can't say enough good things about my experience with this business!
5-star,1,"anthony was fabulous at the front desk and this place gives great service with reasonable prices. they are quick, dependable, and professional. i witnessed a rude customer while there and anthony responded with patience, grace, dignity, and respect. it is hard to be in customer service, but i will always use tire depot because they treat customers well and have good prices."
5-star,1,"i've taken my car in to these folks for a simple tire plug/patch so i knew they did good work. a friend of mine came up from atlanta and had a flat tire near south park mall. i went to her, changed out the tire but couldn't see where the puncture was. i recommended taking the tire to the tire depot where they found the issue (was not a puncture but another cause), fixed the tire and put it back on the car. when asked how much they were owed, the manager said ""nothing"" since no repair was actually needed. you just don't find that high level of service in many places but this shop had it to spare (no pun intended folks). with that sort of integrity, i'd highly recommend them!!"
5-star,1,called to see if they had my tire size and they didn't. shawn told me that the truck came in at 215pm and he would call. at 2 pm eric called and let me know the tires are in shawn and eric are great! best priced tires!!!
5-star,1,"i had to drive to chicago. the tread on my tires are worn. i needed to replace all four asap. i actually called another tire business and the owner kept me on the phone for 20 minutes educating me on tire quality and the best he has come across. he quoted me his prices. i asked if that was the best price? he was firm. i said thank you and decided to shop around based on his recommendation- yoko versado noir. with a trip coming up the next day, i need to bargain shop and save mula. i called 10 other tire shops around charlotte. this tire depot was the only one that did not charge an arm in the leg for the yoko's. $80-$100 less than their competitors. shaun and slim were very kind and willing to work with me on arranging to get my tires replaced same day. they only had two tires but were able to have the other two delivered to the shop. no extra charge. they called when all tires were available and my husband went straight there. took about an hour, which was good, because they were super busy. we drove 11 hours the next day towards chicago. smooth ride all the way. performed well even hitting these damn infamous potholes in the city. tires also made a difference on the gas usage. never owned or knew about yoko brand but i am glad i bought them. waaaaaay more affordable than other brands. go ahead and get quotes from their competitors. you will see that the tire depot is the place to go. great service. great prices."
5-star,1,ordered my tires and got a very good price. the tires showed up on my door in 26 hrs. the best online experience ever!
5-star,1,"happy with overall experience, no wait, quick service, friendly & knowledgeable employees. very nice and accommodating waiting area. will be recommending for anyone looking for great prices on tires."
5-star,1,my car informed me that it was time to rotate my tires. i saw that tire depot had a yelp offer for rotations so i stopped in. i was in and out in less than 15 minutes. the employees were friendly and the waiting room was clean. i'll be back in 5000 miles for my next rotation.
5-star,1,"after a horrible flat tire experience (alone at night and 2 hours from home, roadside assistance that didn't pull through, finally getting the spare on only for it to also go flat in seconds, boyfriend having to drive down to rescue me), the tire depot made it so painless and easy to get it replaced. before going in, i spoke with anthony on the phone about my options, and when i arrived at the location he came out to my car to meet me. i had several questions and he answered all of them for me and gave me a great peace of mind. i got a fair price on two tires plus an insurance policy for both, and anthony was also kind enough to give me $5 off of the installation fee and rotated the tires and fixed the air pressure in all of my tires as well. i would definitely go back again in the future!"
5-star,1,"fast, friendly, and super affordable. seriously, how did we ever make it through life before the yelp app? after having the worst three day span of car bad luck (three screws, three tires) and paying way too much at my dealership to fix the first two, i found these guys just five minutes away from my house. i drove over on a saturday morning. the man behind the counter was nice as could be and helpful. everyone i dealt with here just really made the experience painless (i mean, let's be honest car issues are not exactly a day at the spa). because of where the screw was, he couldn't plug it. they didn't have a tire that would work in stock, so he ordered one for me. he then put air in the tire to help hold me over until monday when the new one arrived. i got a phone call monday morning that my tire was in and drove on over to the plaza. i think i was in and out in about an hour. spent a lot less here for my tire than i did at my dealership. for a car place, the waiting room was pretty nice. they have coffee available. at the time of my visit, they had a yelp check-in offer of a free tire rotation. while i was here, i discovered a tamale place right next door (delicious) and also the sandwich shop is right across the street behind the china bowl. both are cash only, so be prepared."
4-star,1,service was great. they were quick and helpful and not too expensive when it came to new tires. waiting room was nice compared to most tire spots
5-star,1,"my mechanic told me i had a nail in my tire. since tires aren't his specialty i had to hunt down someone to help. after reading terrible reviews for a f*rest*ne up the way, i settled on tire depot, thanks to some good reviews here and elsewhere online. thankfully the reviews were spot on! anthony and the rest of the crew were awesome. the process was so fast from start to finish, and i especially loved how transparent they are- they rolled the tire out to show me the nail from the exterior, and then mounted it so i could see the angle from the inside, while explaining why a patch wouldn't work. if they had not done that and simply told me it couldn't be fixed, i might have felt it was a less trustworthy assessment. they sold me a new tire at a reasonable price, and gave me some good advice to check with my mechanic about next time i take my car in. all in all i'm very pleased to have found a neighborhood place to take care of my tire needs."
5-star,1,"thank you for taking care of me. after getting the run around from big chains and shady little shops the tire depot took great care of me. within 20 minutes they were able to fix everything that the other guys messed up even though i didn't buy the tires from them. the staff was friendly and the owner recognized me. he came out to say hi and thank me for coming back. professional, quick, friendly and clean. i will never go anywhere else."
5-star,1,"i called 3 hours before coming in, they had my tires in stock (i was shocked because it is hard to find locally) great price and and fast turn around.. will recommend"
5-star,1,"i live in virginia and i was planning on visiting a friend in charlotte, nc. upon plenty of research, this place gave me a price on 4 new tires and installation that beat all other competitors i could find by over $100. there site said that if i order online, i should receive a call within 48 business hours to tell me they are in stock. i got a call 1.5 hours after my order saying that someone was going to the warehouse right now and they were going to pick up my tires and i could install them by 1, which was 2 hours after the call, 3.5 hours after the order. i went there the next week, no appointment made, within 25 minutes i returned from a local eatery, and my tires were just being finished. great prices, great service, great staff. i have already recommended this place to multiple people and will continue to do so."
5-star,1,"new set of tires: in and out in 30 minutes. i called before 11:30 and their truck hadn't made deliveries to their locations yet that day, so i was able to order them on the phone, and they had them ready for me only about 2 hours later. excellent experience--i'll be back!"
5-star,1,i had a bubble in my tire so i needed to replace the tire. i walked in and was helped right away. the job took about 15-20 minutes and i was off. the tire and work was affordable. i will be going back whenever i need to replace my tires or need a rotation.
5-star,1,"friendly, fast and cheap! i went in to repair a tire with a nail in it and from the time i stepped out of my car to signing my bill and getting my keys back, it couldn't have been more than 10 min. i just needed a patch and it was only $10! everyone who worked there was friendly and eager to help me and they gave me a free tshirt to boot. definitely going back there!"
5-star,1,i was stuck on a rainy day on my way to work with a screw in the front tire of my mini. these guys were nice and polite. they fixed my car quickly. the place is clean and comfortable. great service.
5-star,1,"great friendly service. had a nail in my tire. they patched it from the inside, no charge! free! great idea because i'll be loyal from here on out!"
4-star,1,"about a year ago, i was in need of new tires. the mini s had been going through them like i was just wrapping the wheels in pink erasers. this was to be my third set in four years and 25k miles. what can i say? i drive it like the people in the commercials do... the guys at speedy's hooked me up with an affordable set of w rated sneakers for the cooper that have held up really well. they rotate the tires for free every 5k miles or so and if a puncture in your tire is repairable, they do it at no charge. this was handy when i picked up a screw last week. they took off the tire and cleaned out all the fix-a-flat gunk (which they informed me can eat away at your rims if you leave it in too long, causing leaks), plugged the hole, and had me on my way in no time at all. these guys are the epitome of professional and i highly recommend them for tires or inspections. free keurig coffee while you wait in their very clean shop that is located across from the food lion on the plaza. a true stand out apart from the number of scary garages on that stretch of road."
1-star,0,"the saga continues i got a call from them today, thought it was about cleaning the headlight but no i have to bring the car back cause they never got emissions done. so another half day wasted along with the other 1.5 days wasted last week. the thing is no one seems to care once the car leaves lot."
5-star,1,"adam goldring and thrifty, gilbert az rock. i'm close to the vest on compliments. i've purchased two vehicles from them. one when i was living in las vegas and my most recent after i moved to tucson. both deals i got exactly what i wanted with a minimum hassle and no b.s. on this latest deal i probably saved $5000 i knew what i wanted (2016/17 taurus limited or sho.). we went on line and checked national inventory for sale. i found the exact vehicle and color i wanted. i was upside down on my trade and my new payments were less than previous. he worked out an excellent price for the vehicle and arranged a great financing deal they took my trade on the spot and gave me a decent loaner to use until my vehicle arrived in less than a week. the whole transaction took two and a half hours. a blessing and well worth the two-hour drive from tucson drive for a no hassle car buying experience. i'll buy all my cars here. i average a vehicle change every two years. this is a professional outfit to do business with and a great example of travelling a little to save a lot."
5-star,1,"i recently totaled my car and was looking for a great quality used car. a friend of mine told me about thrifty car sales. i walked onto the lot and met the owner adam who i explained my situation to and he asked me what type of car i was looking for, he took the time to have me sit in multiple mid size suvs. adam is externally knowledgeable about all cars and options. i was blown away about the detail he knew on each car. i found the car of my dreams and this was the easiest car deal i have ever done. there was no pressure and i was able to find a car that fit my needs and price point. i would highly recommend thrifty cars."
5-star,1,we purchased a used car from thrifty car sales recently. george nano was our salesman. we were pleased with the level of service they staff provided for us and also the detail to attention with our new car fixing the small problems we saw before we purchased. george and the staff were straightforward with us. i would recommend going to thrifty car sales if you are looking for your next vehicle.
1-star,0,"my father in law bought a used car here. when he told us to pick him up because the car wasn't ready i was suspicious. when we showed up and saw a worker walking with with a jump starter to the back that looked extra suspicious. finally they said they wouldn't have the car ready and would deliver it. okay? why would a car be for a sale if it wasn't ready to go? car ran for about a day then wouldn't turn on. called dealership and they said they would take a look at it but he'd have to pay for their tow truck to come get it. needless to say, i wouldn't recommend this place. you'd have the same odds if you got a random car off the street."
1-star,0,"i wish i can give these a professional fucks of -10 stars. do not go here to try to purchase a vehicle. the owner is so unprofessional. so i'm warning you do not go here to purchase a vehicle. i currently have a 2015 audi, ok so i was looking for a vehicle for my son. so after a few days of harassing phone calls saying that i was approved 100% and i have text messages to prove it. i decided to see what they're talking about. so i went down myself and my son on a saturday evening. long story short, i ended up picking out a 2014 chevy malibu with 32,000 miles on it. alright, so the sales person, sean, myself and my son went for a test drive. on the test drive we didn't hit the highway, so i didn't really get a good feel of the car. however, something didn't seem right, because it didn't drive is smooth as it should have. alright, we made it back to the dealership, they crushed up some numbers and everything appeared to look good. so at this time, it was taking a bit longer than i anticipated. had to take my son to a basketball training. so, i had to leave abruptly, but i said i will return asap. anyway, as i was walking out to my car, the owner was like, are you coming back? i was like, ""yeah"". he was like, why don't you take the malibu and just come on back will have the paperwork ready for you. i'm like sure! so if i left and decided to take the highway to get to my house just so i can just get this uneasy feeling i had about this car out. sure enough once i hit the stretch of the highway, merging onto traffic and gave it a little gas, that joker started buckling and the engine light did come on. i got off on the next exit & circled around and brought it right back to the dealership and said that is no deal. i left the car running just in case the engine light went off if i turned off ignition. long story short, the owner come out and tells me i need to take the deal it's just a light that comes on here or there when i gas cap is loose or broken. he said if there were major problems the engine light would be red not orange. i literally laughed out! i said you mean when the temperature is running hot that will be hot and the engine light has always been orange on every car i've driven! he got mad because i called him out. his whole tune changed even greater. he says you got approved and we dropped the interest rate to 6.9% and dropping payments to $250 vs $444. all liesssss! walking off, (100 meters away), the owner, says you won't get approved anywhere else anyway! wow! such an ass andunprofessional! i wasn't rude or anything to this man. i declined their deal professionally. he got mad because i didn't buy that piece of shit! i am no dummy or fool! i know about cars and you ain't go pressure me into getting one of your junk cars with a problem already! foh! i will be filing a formal complaint with the better business bureau and thrifty the corporate office. he doesn't need to be in business representing thrifty and treating customers with disrespect and dishonesty."
1-star,0,"the sales reps were good. i liked them. the maintenance department was a very poor experience....i bought used from here and knew i should've never gone through with the purchase. tires were warped, rotors were warped, started hearing a weird sound from the rear of the jeep. took to my mechanic and he said the transfer case was going out. the fluid was black and gritty indicating that the metal from the transfer case had been grinding for years. way longer than the 9 months i've owned the vehicle. now i'm stuck trying to sell it broken or replace it for under the price i paid for it. i also have had the check engine light come on. i went back to them and they fixed it for free. i went back a few months later cause the same thing happened. then just recently it happened again. needless to say i'm not going back again for a cheap fix that doesn't actually repair the issue. same goes with some of the hoses on the vehicle. their inspections are bs. you are just as well off buying on craigslist or off the street. they try to sell you on the warranties and how it's safer than buying off the streets. it's not.....go to a horne/chapman dealership it's way better."
1-star,0,"they sell junk cars to people with no credit at high interest rate. was going to buy a car and have it shipped. read the negative reviews and decided to show up in person instead. the car was in poor condition and needless to say i did not buy. drove all the way there for nothing, thanks thrifty."
1-star,0,"i bought a 2010 kia sportage. the car did not come with a spare tire. i told the dealer that, they said they will get one in about a week. from the moment i drove it, it smoked a lot. the engine would die from time to time. they put a 30 day warranty on it. out of those 30 days the car was there for about 2 weeks with problems. after the 30 days the car was trash. i told them i will take it to the dealership and have it fixed. they said they would pay me back for all my problems and rental car. they didn't. do not buy from there. shady place. all their cars crap. stay away."
1-star,0,fals advertising. went there because of a newly advertised car and it turned out it was already sold two weeks ago. seems they just use cheap cars as bait to get you into the shop. staff was not very knowledgable.
1-star,0,"while the sales people there are very friendly, and honestly try to help you get a good deal, that is where all the positives stop. their ""thrifty certification"" is a joke. my car made it through that inspection with a ghetto rigged part that caused the car to die, constantly. the complete service department is honestly a joke. i had to find the parts and part numbers, and show them what was wrong, because they couldn't find it, yet i could, and i am not a car person, at all. some encounters left me having to hunt down, and talk to the owner, and he is as incompetent as the rest of his staff. no one here knows how to communicate, and hardly knows how to do their job. do yourself a favor, and just stay away!"
1-star,0,"these guys are not reputable at all! they sell you a warranty and assure you it's good anywhere (in the us) then they tell me that only they can fix it when i try to use it! i called the company on the signed contract and they ""cant"" do anything till the dealer submits it. it has been a year. i asked the dealer several months ago to get it submitted and they said they would ""fix""it. what if i travel and it breaks down? how can i use the road hazard coverage? !!"
1-star,0,"i bought a vehicle 12 days ago with 58,000 on the odometer. since driving it off the lot i have learned a great deal about the car: frame damage in the back, out of alignment (hopefully not permanent damage from the previous accident), cracked radiator reservoir (which they new when they sold it. it had been jb welded. it failed me on vacation 5 days after and had to be towed), broken motor mounts, wrong sized tires installed with floating spacers (discount tire said they can't touch tires with spacers because there is too much liability since they are dangerous), a bad battery (which i waited for two hours to be replaced- the owner called midway through and instructed the mechanic to put the old one back in and not tell me), broken hood holder (don't know the real name), and i found out today it has a major electrical issue (broken neutral safety switch). every person i have spoken to at the dealership is very sorry but their hands are tied because the owner, adam, is in charge and everyone is afraid of him (including me). i'm supposed to go on vacation with my kids tomorrow and i am scared to death to drive it. i asked them to take this vehicle back. they said the owner will probably not do it. i'm hoping he changes his mind and someone gets back to me soon. maybe he didn't realize the extent of the damages. maybe he'll change his mind. just remember, buyer beware! if they toss you the keys and tell you to go ahead and take it home while you wait for financing, it's yours. i'm checking with my credit union tomorrow to see if there is any recourse on the loan. trade in value is $6000. i paid $12995 with taxes and fees. i can't afford to eat the difference but don't know what else to do."
4-star,1,"just bought a car from these guys and got a really good deal. jb hawn was my salesman. jb gave great service, made sure everything was taken of without a hitch."
1-star,0,"complete waste of time and points against your credit report just to have them throw insults to try and complete a car sale. i was advised one day i could a car for one price and i qualified just to be told the next day the price was non negotiable they told me the only car i could get was one i had no interest in not to mention had body damage. after being told this is the only deal i would get anywhere i've was told my payment would be almost $500/mo, again not a car i wanted our even liked. when i said i needed to think about it they got a little rude, which i guess is expected from salesmen. the next day i get a call saying i could get a car i liked at a payment below 200$ and that i am ""too old to be riding a scooter"" i rearranged my schedule to go bike deal happen to be told your too late wet sold the car. the car was not sold its still sitting on the lot. this lot will wine and done you and make it sound like they are the only ones that can finance bad credit, which is not true. at the end of the day they refused to lower the price of any car, strong arm you into cars that are their junk cars so they can get rid of them and then play games to get you back into the dealership for another round of time wasting games. your better off going to a mom and pop shop, at least they tell it like it is."
1-star,0,if i could give this place 0 stars i would. the owner is crazy after consistent calls and text to try to make a deal instead of respecting my need to shop around since the two vehicles they had in my price range where both lemons he decided to insult and threaten me. thank god i record my calls and save my text. buyer beware
1-star,0,"probably one of the most shadiest dealership in the valley. none of their cars have a price on them at the lot or even when they post online and the reason for that is so they can bait and switch. they tell you a different price over the phone but when you go to the dealership the price changes. wants more money for a 2013 used charger then what you can buy a brand new 2015 charger for, and the stupid manager got pissed because we didnt want to pay what he thinks the car was worth. as you can see from other reviews that adam(manager) is a total a-hole. avoid this place at all cost. do your research on the price of a car before you even step in to this shit hole. i heard the manager saying they are selling so many cars and bla bla, well i guess thats why their ads are all over craigslist ?? because they are selling so many cars? what a joke."
5-star,1,this is a great place to get your cars from the staff are really straight forward no bull sh!+. getting my first oil change for free after buying my dodge nitro from them. we had some crappie credit and they were able to help us get into a newer car for not much hassle and were able to help us get what we wanted i will come back for my next car when it's time for a new one thanks for the great service thrifty car sales.....
1-star,0,"hi my name is jason m, i went to thrifty car to get a car and they put me in a 2006 gmc envoy. i was driving it for 3 months, then the owner adam goldring called me and told me that he does not want me to have that car. he never told me why, he just said if i don't bring it back he will repo the car i paid a 1800 down payment for and i was making my payments to them on time i told him no, then a tow truck came to my house and towed it away back to thrifty. i went down there and they told me adam ""just left"" and they would not give me back my deposit so i called adam and he told me he has the perfect car for me he put me in a 1997 ford expedition with 210,000 miles on it, i had no choice so i had to take it. he called it his mexico car because he said that's what the mexicans drive then he laughed he also told me nothing was wrong with it when i started to drive it stalled a lot and so i took it to a mechanic and he told me a lot was wrong with it and it would cost $2,000 to fix it and then i found out he told the bank that is financing it that it was a 2003 ford expedition i just called him on his cell phone and he told me that he had to tell the bank that because they would not finance a 1997 and he said all he can do is trade it out he was so rude too. he talked over me a lot and he started to yell at me and tell me that his car was also broken and it's the heats fault the ford is broken because it never did good in summers i hate thrifty car so much. the only nice person there was a manager named mike. here is an update they repoed my car on 7/23/13 saying my car payment was late when the paperwork they gave me says that my payment is not even due till 7/24/13 they wont even let me get my truck and every one just keeps telling me to call and talk to a guy named dave but he is never there i have a lot of expensive stuff in the car and i still have the keys for the car all i want is my stuff what can i do"
1-star,0,"well i guess you're never too old to learn, it was great when i was buying my car from them, but once something goes wrong(like a battery) they turned their backs on me. so all they had to do is replace my battery but they told me that its not covered in the warranty(which wasnt covered in the 3mo warranty in the first place) never again will i deal with these crooks!!!!!!!!!!"
4-star,1,"during the past summer my lovely 95 honda accord decided it no longer wanted to be the car for and set itself on fire while i was driving to work, making sure repairs were unable to be performed. that may not be how it actually went down, but that's how i reenact it, i was the main attraction in a one float parade, sparks & flames, what a show! saved up some money, got my finances in shape to afford a car payment and set off to find a car, my daughter's husband pointed me toward thrifty auto sales, they picked me up on a friday morning and told me we are car shopping, i was already little depressed about this whole car shopping experience, and just felt that it wasn't going to work out for me. when we got their we were greeted by jessie, who was the main guy who helped me out, and i told jessie right up front what i have to put down on the car, how much i want the payments to be and told him i don't like wasting time. i test drove a few cars, did find the one that is perfect for me all the way around, price, payment, size, have to say even though car buying can be a stressful thing, this transaction went extremely smooth and easy and never felt pressured. if i was in need of another car, i wouldn't think twice about going back!"
1-star,0,"i have never seen such dishonesty!!! was all set to go pick up a car in the morning that they had purchased for me today and now a text that they sold it to someone else. talk about lack of integrity and honesty??? obviously if this is the way they do busines you can imagine all the other shady things they are doing. stay clear of these guys,"
1-star,0,"caution, beware, stay away!!!!! i recently moved to chandler and driving by this place years after the fact reminded me of the horrible experience. that's why i have made it a point to review it today. it was the single worst experience i have ever encountered with purchasing a vehicle. the manager adam goldring completely lacks integrity and pulls out all the usual used car sales tactics. to make a long story short i was considering purchasing a car there and i was running late for work so i told adam i would have to come back later. problem was, he had my keys for my existing car... i was literally being held hostage and he wouldn't let me leave until i agreed to place a deposit on my credit card to secure the vehicle. i was so frickin' mad i was about to call the police and demand my keys and claim hostage... because i didn't feel like wasting time, i decided to agree to the credit card deposit. 5 minutes after, as i was driving away... i called my credit card company and asked that the transaction be immediately reversed. there was no way i was going to deal with someone like that, i can't imagine what a person would have to go through, throughout the ownership of the vehicle if this is at all a reflection of their service. adam blew up my phone about 20 times and left a dozen voice-mail, all of which i deleted... the funny thing is, i would have bought the vehicle if the sales manager wasn't such a pushy douche bag. (after finding out the car had hidden damage mind you)... unbelievably horrible car dealership."
1-star,0,"luckily i read the reviews on yelp before i decided against purchasing from here.... i saw an ad on craigslist for the car i wanted. when i emailed about it, the manager adam goldring, called back and wouldn't give me a price on it. he said that their pricing fluctuates depending on the market or something and changes day to day. really?? that gave mean warning flag. he pressured me into making an appointment to see the car the same day. i did, but then got online and read the reviews and it made me change my mind. a few hours later i call to cancel the appointment, and very politely say i'll reschedule when it's better for me. 5 days have passed and i've had about 6 calls from them on my voicemail trying to get me to come down there. back off already! 1 star for being annoying. to update: ""tj"" is actually the owner adam. he just personally messages me about my review i had previously posted. he wrote to me ""i've had 7 bad reviews and have sold over 5,000 cars, that's pretty good..."" um no its not. as a business owner, why would you say that? it's embarrassing to have that many. you are obviously a shady character with no integrity. to come on here and give yourself a 5 star review pretending to be a customer is disgusting. no adam, i will never ever buy a car from you. to this day your shady people still call me. ugh...."
1-star,0,"worst car dealership ever!!! be careful, they do not make deals with integrity. they sold us a car, but we we were not happy with it. at first they told us the car had 70,000 miles and in great shape. we made a mistake of signing papers before seeing the car. well, when they delivered the car, we were shocked. they gave us a dirty car with a hole in the trunk, broken windshield, worn tires, smelled like a wet dog and cigarettes on the interior, and on top of that the mileage was over 110,000 miles. after we drove home, we called back and asked for a different car. they replied that they would look into changing cars. to make a long story short. they did not change cars, got us locked into a deal we could not get out of, a premium on top of the car that made us pay over list, interest rate that would make a loan shark envious, and did nothing to change cars. nightmare of an experience for us."
1-star,0,"can i give this place a zero? this was the worst experience i have ever had with a dealership. it started off fairly normal. a guy and a girl (me and mine) drove up to their lot with intentions of looking and perhaps purchasing a used car. we were shown to an 07 hyundai accent with only 10,000 miles. we inquired about the price of the car and were asked to take it for a test drive while they ""looked that up"". we reluctantly agreed since we didn't even know the price. after we got back is when things got dicey. we went into the dealership and again asked the price. the sales man said we had to wait while they were still pulling up the blue book value. while we were waiting he started asking fairly normal questions like, ""how much do you want to put down?"" and ""how much can you afford a month?"" i again asked how much the car cost. he then went into the bubble supposedly to see if it had been found yet... meanwhile i could have blue booked it from my phone in less time. when he came back he was flanked by a big gulp slurping manager. this man was beyond rude. what i am going to say might surprise you. he instantly started badgering me about buying the car now and how he stole it below wholesale and make an offer and its ours today and how can i not leave with this car. after i evaded his high pressure tactics he asked if i was ready to buy today. i replied, ""no."" he then kept badgering so i told him we were going to leave. this wasn't good enough. after he kept pestering us i whispered to my girlfriend that we should just leave. we got up and he followed. he continued loudly nagging us until we were out the front door. when we got outside he then said, ""how dare you come into a dealership not ready to buy and just look, you are wasting my time and my sales peoples time by coming in here not ready to buy."" he was practically yelling at this point. as we got into my car then said two words. (ear muffs children) ""fucking assholes."" first i was annoyed, then offended by the wasting time comment. now, i was angry. i got out of the car and asked him what he said. he said that he said have a nice day. i then said ya know what... fuck you. pardon my language but as i said, i was quite angry at this point. he ran into the dealership and i stayed out of my car fuming with what had transpired. he waited a few minutes and came back and actually continued to try and sell me the hyundai. i whispered to my companion to ask for his card so we could somehow complain to someone about him, he went inside to get the card and then we told him we had no intentions of buying a car from someone who treats their customers this way. he then leaned with all his weight onto my side mirror of my car and an audible crack was heard. i believe he did this on purpose however that is just conjecture. as we get into the car to leave he leaned by the window and said don't go to a dealership until you are ready to buy and then said, ""hey, you know that business card i gave you? that's not even me!! hahaha"" he cackled, ""that's just someones card from inside!!"" over all, zero stars. please don't go here. for me."
1-star,0,"this location was convenient for me because its near my job. but i will never come back to this location again. i came in to purchase 2 rear tires. i made my appointment online because i hate being haggled with the purchase of additional services. also online you can opt of out things they don't mention in the store, it's just automatically included unless you say something. so with my new tires, i removed the option to replace the tpms sensors. because i'd already spoken with my dealership who said it is not necessary to replace these with every set of new tires and this was a new car. so i arrive and tell the guy that i had an appointment. he asked me my name and proceeds to ask me details about my car so he can see if they have my tires. as he does this i mention to him that my appointment was confirmed so shouldn't all of this be in their system. he agrees then prints out a price higher than i was quoted online because he'd added all of the ""hidden services"" on and charged me for more expensive tires. i tell him thats not the price that i was given online and that i did not want those services. he proceeds to tell me then that he couldn't find an appointment for me. so i pulled up my confirmation email on my phone. so he then asked another associate for help in finding my appointment. he finally finds it and here comes the haggling about my tpms sensors. i tell him i do not want them replaced at this time and that they need to be mindful when replacing the tires not to break them. he continues on and on about how it can throw my tire light off and now i'm annoyed and cut him off to remind him of what i just said. so he finally stops. as i'm waiting for my tires i see him walking my way with something in his hand. what do ya know, its a broken tpms sensor! he proceeds to tell me how this was broke when they found it and again that i need to get them all replaced. you can imagine how mad i am now. i'd just got my 2 front tires replaced at the salisbury nc location with no issues. by this point i tell him to just leave me alone and finish with my tires so i can go. the next morning i get in my car on my way to work and i hear a very loud noise coming from my tires. luckily i live right around the corner from a location so i go immediately there. the associate hops in my car and drives around and comes back. he then pulls my car into the garage, fix it, and bring my car back to me. something about the way the tires were installed. now i also have a constant tire pressure light on thanks to charlotte. trust me, stay away from the south blvd charlotte location."
2-star,0,"so, i really don't know how to feel about this place. wait, yeah i do. i have come here for routine oil changes & as far as that goes, i haven't had any problems. but oil changes are easy. even i can do that, i just don't wanna; it's not really that cost effective for me to do it myself. it seems anything more complex could be an issue... i just got off the phone with a guy about some tires i was trying to get. i called last week, said what i wanted, was told they'd be ready monday. called today, monday, was told they didn't have the tires. but not a, ""we're getting them and they're just not here yet"", more of a ""the guy who took your call last week didn't bother to write down anything and i'm not going to write down anything either."" was quoted a price that was over what it should be per the website. was asked if i could hold on, before i could answer, was put on hold. so, i decided just to hang up. i'm really not surprised because.... a couple of years ago, i needed to get a wheel replaced on my car. i set up a day & time to bring it by; they would have the right wheel for the car. took my car in at 8 am. came back at 5:30 pm and the wheel was not replaced. why? because the part they got was the wrong one. which means they didn't bother to get the part until 5:30 pm when i showed up or didn't bother to do the work until i showed up. after the car had been there for 9 hours. a few hours later, i was out the door. they were able to get the right part and put it on. in the process, they broke my hupcap, but at that point i didn't care as it was the day before thanksgiving and i was tired. get it?! har har! i'm not sure whether it's laziness or incompetence or both. whatever, which pretty much seems to be the attitude at this tire kingdom."
1-star,0,"if it were possible, i would not even give them a single star. i went in for a routine oil change expecting to pay the advertised price of $19.99 plus a $3.00 disposal charge. after waiting an hour or so for my car ( i was the only person there) the store manager came rushing out to tell me there was a problem. alarmed, i asked what was going on. he informed me that there was no coolant in the reservoir and they were going to run a ""pressure test"" to find what the problem was, before i could object the mechanic came out, equally as flustered with a broken piece in hand and said he was going to find the part at napa next door. at this point, the manager and mechanic leave the room and leave me feeling very anxious and confused. about ten minutes later, the manager comes back out and presents me with a bill for $150!! he then explains to me that one of my high beams bulbs were out and they would be replacing that as well. i was furious at this point and told him absolutely not to do anything to my light bulbs. he ran over to the phone to let the mechanic to cancel the bulb service and presented me with a new bill still charging me for the useless pressure test. i reluctantly paid and left the store feeling as though i had been robbed. i have filed a compliant with ntb but i will never set foot into another tire kingdom again. all in all, i paid $30.95 for my oil change (gotta love those hidden charges) and another $29.99 for the pressure test that resulted in the mechanic saying my radiator hoses were old and needed to be replaced. they gave me a quote for $434.00 to replace those for me.. no thanks! -also interesting is this review was magically removed a few days later even though yelp claims to not allow businesses to alter or remove posts.. pretty strange if you ask me."
5-star,1,"came in to have my car inspected after getting a ticket for an expired registration (whoops) i was in and out in 25 minutes. the entire staff was so helpful, and spent time answering my questions about going to the dmv and getting a new registration. i appreciated their time, since the questions really didn't have anything to do with reason i was there. i had an exceptional experience with their sales associate, anne kelly. she recommended a few other services for my car while being professional but not pushy. i love these guys!"
5-star,1,"these guys are seriously great. i moved down to charlotte from maine, and this place was recommended. i have a '97 lincoln town car, and it had a myriad of problems. they charged me a very low labor fee to figure out what was wrong with my lights. i'd brought it to multiple garages and they could never figure it out. well buffalo tire did, though i wasn't willing to pay for the replacement part since it was worth more than my car. instead, louis (my favorite mechanic), worked some 'voodoo' on my car and now my lights work better with just a few minor adjustments, so i can live with my car's handicap until the end of its life. louis is the best mechanic i've ever had to deal with - i'd ask for him if you go there. great customer service as well, though don't mind tom - he's just a bit of a curmudgeon. also very accommodating, and free wi-fi, so bring your laptop for those long waits."
1-star,0,"i came in to get four tires balanced bc they were causing vibration. the staff was super friendly at face value but the quality of their work is negligent for a couple reasons. 1. they balanced the tires ok, no problem 2. my tires are directional which means they can only be mounted in one direction. all four tires were mounted in the wrong direction. lucky i noticed this before i drove in heavy rain otherwise i might've spun out. 3. they over torqued my lug nuts. i put my torque wrench on the nuts and found they torqued them to 110ftlbs!!!! that's roughly 25-35 too much. it doesn't sound like much but i had to use a 5ft steel pipe to undo my lugs. luckily they didn't damage my wheels. for those of you that aren't familiar with car maintenance this might sound like nitpicking but i caution you these items are both things that any standard shop is trained to look out for. don't go here if you value safety and quality of work. i'm really disappointed."
1-star,0,"nothing but scam artists and are only good for tire repair or adding air to the tires, that's the only reason they have received 4 to 5 stars. i am not sure why i wrote this review as all the other reviews are negative adding to 2 stars. southern highlands is a working class professional community and its sad that we have to deal with this. my review: bought a set of 4 tires approximately 1.5 years ago with 15,000 miles on the tires. i called the manufacturer and told them there was a defect on the tire as it went flat. they suggested to take it back to where we purchased it and show it to them. we took it there went up to the counter and they said pull the car around as the flat tire was in the rear of the car. the tire tech with the manager mark put air in the tire and it took a minute or two to try and actually locate the leak which happened to be on the sidewall...a horizontal 1/2'' separation at the seam. mark told the tire tech to remove the tire from the rim. some girl walked up into the working bay we were in and mark and her went into his office. the tire tech then called us into the repair bay and asked us if i drive the car with low inflated tires. who does that! then mark came out and said that we were not allowed in the repair bays, i told him we only went in there at the request of the tire tech. so, i waited an hour for someone to tell us what the status was on the tire. i saw the tire in the bay being untouched while 2 trucks came in for air in their tires. i then told the counter guy that i would be back and left him my number to call me with the status. four hours later i returned, the tire untouched. i spoke with what appeared to be the bug boss who was professional and courteous and explained to me, that i would have to wait on mark and the other to address the status. after 10 minutes mark and the other guy showed up and mark said they would not replace the tire as we had punctured the tire. i argued with him that there was no puncture and if that was the case, then why did we have to wait 5 hours to get that information, when that could have been determined when he first saw it. he then persistently told me to come in the repair and see the puncture. in the bay area we argued about the unfair determination of his assessment of the damage to the tire...continually stating that it was punctured. i reiterated why didn't he tell us that when he first saw it and he did not answer. i told him to put the tire back on the rim in the same manner we brought it in, but he told the tire tech to not put it together. he refused to do it and i told him that he was going to put it in. i then told him if he wasn't so busy with that girl in the office taking care of personal business while a customer waited 5 hours for a simple decision on a defected tire, this could have been resolve. he the started to physically attack me and his boss had to hold him back. i apologized to him after some comments i made. the girl according to him happened to be his sister. his boss acting very professionally told the tire tech to mount the tire on the rim and explained to me what due process i have. i would highly recommend you do not bring your car here unless you just need air in you tires. the techs are good but the counter people and mark are running a scam, especially when they quote you a price and then lower the price if you pay cash. i have been dealing with them for years and live in the community for over 14 years. 1 star!!!!!"
1-star,0,"do not come here!!!! if i could give this place zero stars i would. first experience coming here was because there was a split in my tire, and this place is right by my house so i went over there. when i got there, the idiot repairman told me that i absolutely had to get my tire replaced at that exact moment or my tire would blow on my way home. he told me the car would flip and i could lose my life, and that my car would 100% be totaled. now, i get it, they're told to sell. but selling and flat out lying are two different things. i drove home (spoiler alert - didn't die, still have my car), and when i went back a couple days later to replace the tire, they charged me $300. for one tire. had i not been super busy that week, i would have gone literally anywhere else. but i was desperate. so anyway, i get my tire and drive home. when i get home, i notice that the tire they replaced was about half the size of the rest of my tires. i mean.. for fucks sake. your company is called tire works. and you don't know how to properly size a tire? what a joke. when i went back to have them change it, they tried to charge me again. my mom called and the guy inside was extremely rude to her. he was a manager but i don't remember his name. they ended up not charging me, obviously, but they tried. i'm assuming they thought that because i'm a female, they could take advantage of me. nice. second time going there (a couple months ago), also the last time i or anyone i know will ever go there, we took the car in to have the brakes checked. the idiot repairman (different one than last time) told us that our front brakes were at 2% and our back brakes were at 4%. we had the front ones replaced, but couldn't afford to get the back ones replaced, due to the ridiculous prices of this shithole. today, which was months after they told us the car's brakes were at 4%, i went to a dealership to have some work done & they told me that my back brakes should be looked at soon because they're at 25%. 25..... not 4. to recap: the people here are rude, disrespectful, and incapable of doing their job correctly hence why they put the wrong size tire on my car. this place is also wildly overpriced, so i have no idea why anyone would come here. i can't wait for the day this place gets shut down. don't come here. go anywhere else. literally, anywhere else."
1-star,0,"highly incompetent employees at the front desk. i came in with a coupon card with three free oil changes. the card says disposal fee not included. i paid $20 for the card--now i realize--for nothing. marion, the guy at the desk, tells me that i still have to pay $34 more for the oil change since my car uses synthetic oil. i showed marion the card and nowhere does it say that it has to be conventional or synthetic--it just says ""free oil change"". i talked to the manager and he had a very bad attitude. i explained that this is false or misleading advertisement. he says, ""you have to read the other part of the card"" (on another page with a perforated part on it). this makes no sense to me. if something is highlighted in yellow and says free, the terms and conditions should be listed on that item, not on a separate page of a coupon book. it's highly misleading and i'm furious that i had to sit here arguing with the manager and associate. highly unprofessional and rude. i will be taking this to the better business bureau and consumer protection agency for false advertising. avoid tire works at all costs, especially this place."
1-star,0,"this place is a joke!! they aren't here to help, they are here to make money. if they even sense you don't have the slightest idea about cars and maintenance and how they work, they are gonna do the absolute most unnecessary labor needed to get it back on the road. recently i had got into a small accident in my 2004 civic where i hit my top left wheel to a curb and bent some internals. when i had them inspect my car, they told me more things wrong than i had suspected and i couldn't believe it because the incident i had got into wasn't that serious. i then had my friend who is a mechanic go and check it out himself and turns out i only needed to do the front left side of the car instead of the entire front suspension! they also overcharged me for parts i found more than. 50% less than what they were gonna charge me. my estimate came out to 2400$ for the repair there and i said hell no. i ended up fixing it myself for 500$ with the right parts and labor. my advice to all of you looking to get autocare in the neighborhood, definitely do your research. for being a local auto care shop, they definitely do not fit the local neighborhood friendly vibe!!"
1-star,0,"i stopped in here at about 3pm today (wednesday) and patiently waited for the person running the counter to get to me (there was only one other person there). after a few minutes the man behind the counter reluctantly asked what i needed and i told him i had a nail in my tire. the nail was more of a ""bolt"", and it was very close to the sidewall, which i knew might not be repairable. when we got to my car to look at it all he said was ""so what do you want? 1? 2? 4?"" and looked at me like i was supposed to know the outcome of what he meant. i said ""tires?"", he said ""yeah, i'm not gonna be able to fix that, so how many do you want?"". literally, word for word. he was incredibly rude. i felt uncomfortable to do business with someone that clearly hated their job so i took my business down the street to discount tire where they treated me with kindness and actually examined my tire and politely told me i would need to replace it. i have no problem spending good money when the professionalism is there. i will not be doing any business big or small with tire works in the future."
1-star,0,they always do stuff i didn't ask for. need brakes tires. then tell my dealership isn't taking care of me. don't go here. and as an extra they promote mary kay in the lobby.
1-star,0,came to this location because it was close by my house. it seems like inexperienced technicians that don't know what they were doing. i will never return. my tires were mounted on wheel inside out and my rims were put on backwards. if you care about your vehicle and want a job done right go elsewhere!
1-star,0,"this place is a nightmare everytime. i bought a warranty in february on brand new tires which i've had to bring in 4 times with flats, this time leaving me on a donut for over a week. they had to order my warrantied tire. got a call they had it five days later when i was out of town, only to come in to find they don't even have the right tire. i don't know what kind of scheme they are running but it's frustrating. the manager mark, i dealt with all week on the phone won't even show his face."
1-star,0,"absolutely rude!! called to ask tire quotes, left on hold forever. had to call back. i do not remember the guy's name, but he basically said ""i can't give you a quote until i know what your budget is"". i have a long list to go thru. basically, it was his tone of voice. it's like he had no time nor patience to answer my questions."
1-star,0,"i've gone to this place a few times for oil changes and i've gotten a set of tires from them before, not great service and pricey but i kept going back because of the convenient location. the last time i went in for an oil change and the guy told me i had literally 5 things wrong with my car, ""breaks, new tires, adjustment, tune up"" & something else i can't remember. i've read the reviews on this place before so i'm always cautious about getting ripped off. after hearing his ridiculous suggestions on what i needed done to my car i called my cousin who is a manager at a similar car place in cali and had him speak to the employee at the desk in ""car talk"" to see if i really needed those things done or if they were trying to rip me off. the employee handed my phone back to me and my cousin told me ""they are trying to rip you off just get your oil changed, your breaks from what he says are at about 80%!!"" and he wasn't being upfront about answering my cousins questions. so i got my oil changed and left, deciding to not go back there... couple weeks later there is a plastic part under my car that covers whatever it needs to cover and blocks the wind. it has come off before and i've had them put it back on for me before at this place. so it had started to come off again and it makes a loud scrapping noise while driving. i go in for them to literally take it off or screw it back on simple fix!! the guy at the desk quotes me $133 just to ""see what's wrong with it?"" uhhhh i just told you what's wrong with it... so i left and took my car to the terrible's oil change place on dean martin and blue diamond couple miles down the road took them 5 minutes they never charged me it was that simple of a fix. do not go to this place! they take advantage of people! and rip people off!!"
1-star,0,very poor quality work done. mechanics have no idea what they are doing the staff was not very friendly as usual. this is not a place that i will actually continue doing business with at any location
5-star,1,"never had any issues, replaced my battery here and my wife got her oil changed recently. she also had a flat tire and they patched it before for her for free."
1-star,0,"i'm writing this as i sit here and wait on my car. very unhappy with this place. brought in my ford escape for an oil change and they wanted $77 dollars for synthetic. i normally pay $45-$50 but if i sign up for some credit card i get $30 off, and it's close to home so i just went with it. mistake #1. i get a call 30 mins later saying i need a new serpentine belt and four new tires. mine are only 40k miles run on, but apparently my side walls and the rubber is cracked and dry rot which increases the risk of a blowout. ok, new tires it is. they want $1000 for four tires for a ford escape? huh? then he tells me they sell one brand that is ""only"" $650 for the set. so i tell them to do the oil, belt, and tires at a cost of $810. this is 10am. he says my car will be done at 11:30. i tell them i have a lunch meeting at 11:30 and will pick it up between 12:30 and 1pm. got here at 12:59. my car is not ready. something about the wrong serpentine belt being sent over and it will be done within 30 minutes. now it's 40 minutes since i arrived and haven't heard anything. and now i'll miss my next meeting because of this which is unacceptable. this will be the last time i do any business here. i wish i had read the other reviews before i dropped my car off here."
1-star,0,you must stay away from this place nothing but deceit and unprofessional staff came for an oil change at 1020 and at 1215 they still haven't even moved the car and when i arrived there was only one car in the garage and none upfront but all of a sudden cars magically appeared out of thin air just because they were paying more than a discounted oil change so stay away from here and don't give them any business at all after 2 hours had to leave to take it somewhere else and i will contact their headquarters about this since it's common practice here
1-star,0,"one word... shady! i bought my car in for an oil change. when it was ready for pick up they told me my car was leaking oil and that i needed to replace the valve cover gasket. i've never seen an oil leak in my garage ever and i had just driven it back from la the day before, with no problems. so i thought this was extremely weird and didn't go ahead with getting it replaced. as soon as i drove it out of there and onto the highway my car smelt like burning oil, you could even see it burning! now oil has been leaking huge puddles everywhere in my garage ever since. i have a built in screen system that tells me when my oil is low, i had more oil in my car before i took it to get serviced???? all this doesn't make sense. this is the 2nd time i've been here and i feel like they'll do anything to rip you off."
1-star,0,"we waited half an hour before someone even came to the front desk. finally the manager doug made an appearance and he was extremely rude. our tire was still under warranty but the guy in the back said the tire shouldn't be patched because of where it was damaged. doug goes back there and makes the guy patch the tire anyway. doug had a million excuses for everything, he talked trash about and blamed the other employees, the system they use, they way this location is run (i was under the impression the manager himself would be responsible for some of these) he then refuses to print out the invoice i requested. i would be skeptical of the 5 star reviews because there were 2 people in before us and they tried to warn us about how bad this place really is, thinking we may be new customers. it's amazing the amount of bs that the manager himself will spew off in order to avoid honoring the warranty. if you have similar experiences you investigate this issue further, escalate as much as possible since they are authorized dealers of certain tires. if you also have problems with the rude manager, tell the corporate office."

1-star,0,so - wife needed new tires on her expedition. i was out of town but told her to go to discount tire and get hankook tires. she went to tire works because it was closer - they didn't have hankooks but told her they had sunfull - which were cheaper and better. this was not correct. they were the worst tires i have ever had - severe under steer and any imperfection in the pavement would launch you in a new direction. tire works was great! they swapped me out for a new set of kumho tires and only charged for the difference in the cost of the tires. it was basically hassle free and no argument. only delay was waiting for second demount and mount. it's nice these days to find an organization that will admit mistake and make good on a deal. really good customer service - it's just too bad that they got sucked in by the incorrect promises made by the tire maker. follow up - a couple of days later got a low pressure warning and the front end began to shake badly at 50 mph. two broken retaining bands on the tp sensors - google why this occurs and you will understand why i went to a different tire store for repair.
1-star,0,i will never be to this place again . i write this in the hopes that you don't get ducked in this vortex of a bad choice. if you enjoy people who don't honor their warranties up selling and just plain bad customer service by all means go! this is your spot. one day they may see the value of keeping the customer happy but i think that is a long ways away. good luck with that guys
5-star,1,"i got my car aligned a few months ago and they were very nice. i moved to california since then and i realized that my car was still turning to the left so i took it when i was here in vegas a month later and they were very accommodating. vince was very helpful and explained to me that my alignment was off by a little bit, but that my power steering was off. he explained to me that he didn't have the tool to fix it, but that he would call around. his co-worker next to him told me to bring my car in the next day and he would take it to another shop to get it fixed. i took my car in and they fixed in for me, they even rotated my tires for me to help the alignment. i highly recommend this place and was very pleased with how i was treated."

1-star,0,"100% scam artists stay away !!! in january of 2014 i came in here to buy new tires and the store manager told me that my tension struts where completely blown out and needed to be changed for an extra $500 because it would destroy the new tires i just purchased. i just bought the tires and said i would come back for the tension struts. fast forward to april of 2014 i go in to get the tension struts and asked for them to put it on the rack and show me first, not informing them who told me i need new tension struts. the store manager comes back and says there is absolutely nothing wrong with your tension struts, what shop told you this? i told him this place did ""tire works"". and he proceeded to apologize informing me that he was the new store manager. (apologize for what ? that tire works was pulling a scam and got caught because i asked them to put it on the rack and show me first ?) then he proceeded to tell me that all the rubber bushings on my ball joints and suspension need to be replaced at $800 because they where shot do to this desert heat and dry weather, he went on to explain how this is normal living in the desert. after he was done trying to feed me yet another complete bull shit lie like the other manager i informed him that this car has never been in the desert since i bought it, i just moved out here from huntington beach, california. all he could say at this point was huh, oh, what, hmmm... i said get my car off the rack i'm done here."

1-star,0,"if it was possible to leave a rating of 0 stars, that's what i would do. do not go to this place. they're incompetent, have lack luster service, and seem to be utterly clueless. i went to tire works on 9-20-2011 around 10 am. i was going there to have a small nail in my front tire repaired. i was also having them replace 1 rear tire and having my alignment done. before they did any work i asked how long it would take since i had a 1 pm appointment. they replied ""less than an hour"". i then gave them cell phone number and asked them to call me when it's done. i returned to the store 2 hours later at noon. my car was not ready yet. i asked how much longer and was told ""soon"" and sat there for about 30 minutes. it's now been 2.5 hours and i have no more time to spare. i ask if my car is ready, of course it's still not ready. after 2.5 hours they have put on 1 tire, that's it. they still have the alignment to do. i tell them no, it's too late i have to go, i ask them to put my car down saying i'll get the alignment done later. it would have been nice to at least receive a phone call saying it was taking way longer than they stated, but no, i ultimately had to tell them to lower the lift and give me my car back pronto. at this point i just thought their service was very lack luster. after my 1 pm appointment i began the drive to southern california (which tire works was also aware of). after about 25 miles into that journey i end up on the side of the road with a flat tire. not just one tire, but two flat tires. they didn't even take the freaking nail out of the tire i initially went to get fixed!!! i call them up saying i bought a tire an hour ago and it's flat, i then ask how they're going to fix this. i'm told he'll see if he can send someone to come help me (i had no spare tire), i was told ""my manager says no"". by now i'm pretty furious and decide that i want anybody but them to fix my tire. i ask them ""are you at least going to replace the tire?"" and the question i get back is ""did you buy the tire protection warranty?"". what?!! i bought the tire 1 hour ago! they took 2.5 hours to change 1 bloody tire! and that tire is now flat!! while i did buy the tire protection plan, to be asked that considering their glaring failure was absolutely infuriating. i then said ""forget it, i'm contesting the charges and returning the tire"". i went to a different tire place to get my tires fixed (after a tow). they did a great job. they bagged the tire i bought from tire works so i could return it. in addition to that they marked the tire indicating where the morons at tire works managed to puncture the brand new tire. that's right, they took 2.5 hours to install and puncture a brand new tire, failed to remove the nail and never completed what was supposed to be done ""in under an hour"". the new tire place i went to in order to fix tire work's incompetence was also less expensive."
1-star,0,i brought my wife's mercury milan and daughter's mercedes e320 in for new tires and break job. they replaced the tires fine. they replaced the rotors on the mercedes and that was okay. they turned the rotors on the milan. the milan had never had the rotors turned. they gave it to us and my wife noticed a pulsating wobble when she stepped on the break. it never wobbled before. we returned the car for them to correct the problem. they obviously torqued the lug bolts incorrectly. they claimed it was the heat that caused this. we're not stupid! they charged us another 200 dollars for new rotors all around (for their mistake). both vehicles cost 3000 dollars to complete. they are idiots at tire works on cactus. don't go there! i will not be back and i live less than a mile away.

5-star,1,"this store is managed better than 1-800 uhaul. they made a mistake, the manager owned up(if you have moved before, you get how rare that is) apologized and made a nightmare move(any move in vegas during the summer) a little easier. if you have to go a few miles out of your way to rent from this u-haul location. do it. it is more than worth it. thank you again. i forgot the manager's name, sorry, but your entire staff was awesome. the only people in vegas that aren't predators in the moving game."
1-star,0,the worst u-haul store in the city. i use u-haul a lot and they know it because they have all my history. today i went there because of the convenience to rent a truck and a tow dolly to cross the country. they told me i will need a auto transport because my car wasn't recommended to use the tow dolly which is $200 more. after questioning them why they told me they wouldn't give me the tow dolly anywhere. i still placed the reservation. i called the online number and asked customer service if it was true what they told me at that store. the customer service told me it wasn't true. so the store lied to me in order to make $200 extra dollars. i'm so fed up being always screwed up in this city.
5-star,1,"wow! customer service here is absolutely amazing! just called to get a hitch and wiring installed and christy was able to help me super quick. she knew i was in a bind and needed installation asap, so she was able to get me an appointment at another location for today because her location was booked. i would highly recommend contacting uhaul and asking for her!"
4-star,1,"able to schedule appointment. they even install hitches on sunday. work began at time promised. installation was completed. took a little longer than estimated, but i had scanned installation instructions for hyundai genesis and knew this installation was complicated. work seems satisfactorily completed although i haven't used hitch to pull a trailer yet. wiring looks professionally installed. overall, will rate as very good. they did want they promised at price estimated at time of appointment."
1-star,0,"i rented a 10-foot truck on the 31st of aug. i walked in to see 3 employees eating behind the desk. very unprofessional, and rude. after signing for the truck, was told to go outside to pickup truck. on walking out, the young (lady) was eating a rather large hotdog. told me to check the mileage and if there was a problem tell her. well, the milage was wrong on my paperwork. lol, she had to finish her dog first. do not rent from here! very low standards! attitude reflects leadership....shame!"
1-star,0,"i would give 0 stars if i could. i was moving across the country and have previously used upack (different company) but this time decided to go with the u-box from uhaul.. because it was cheapest. boy, you sure get what you pay for! in the beginning, the process seemed easy. straightforward pricing, reserve online... convenient. i opted for pickup at the location closest to my house and was sent an email confirmation with a time and address of the location i chose. when the time came to pick up my boxes, i was told that there was no record of my reservation. i showed them my confirmation email, and they told me that my location had not been determined yet (even though it was clearly written on my confirmation email!!) ok whatever, send me to the correct location... this one. everything else seemed to be going well, i picked up 3 boxes and then after loading them, i realized that i may need to add another one. i called and spoke to sabrina (the general manager) and she directed me to a call center to reserve the fourth u-box. i was quoted $89 to add the fourth box, so i did it. little did i know, there was a $816 freight charge associated with that fourth u-box. that information was never disclosed to me, and when i got my final bill down the line, i was just told ""well ma'am there is a freight charge to ship a box"". yes i am aware now of the freight charge, but why was i not made aware of this before i ordered the box? i would have had a garage sale or left some things behind if i knew it was going to run me $816 extra!!! on top of that, i had another confirmation email saying my u-boxes would be delivered to my new home no later than 6/10/16, and for each day they were late, i would be refunded $50/day. seems like a pretty good guarantee, right? we were scheduled to close on our house on 6/10, so that would've worked out perfectly. except it didn't. once my u-boxes were in transit (and i was somewhere in oklahoma....) i got yet another confirmation email, stating my boxes would arrive on 6/13/16. so i immediately call uhaul, i get the run around from sabrina, who is apparently the end all, be all of management at uhaul, because i asked for her supervisor's phone number, and she gave me the number to the call center. the call center!! finally, i went on uhaul.com to find customer service. there is no corporate office - shocking with how giant of a company uhaul is- but i did file a customer complaint, and i was told someone would reach out to me within 24 hours to discuss further. no one ever called. i was forced to stay in a hotel for 2 nights, because all of my belongings (mattress, pillows, blankets) were in the u-boxes. on top of paying for the extra freight charge, i had to pay for a hotel, and i was told that the $50/day ""guarantee"" could no longer be honored, because i added the fourth u-box. what?! again, that would've been something i would've liked to be informed of before i added the fourth box. overall, i can't get over how horrible this place is! bad customer service, no transparency of where my money is going, obviously i'm just paying their salaries. i will never be back to this location, let alone any uhaul ever again."
5-star,1,"crystal! these five stars belong to you! awesome customer service, explained everything in detail and was so friendly. best experience that i've had dealing with u haul so you deserve some kudos! thanks again for your awesome service 7/31 11:30am"
4-star,1,"we have had three towing hitches installed by this location. customer service was kind with a smile each time, zero issues. seems like i made all three appointments online? i can't remember. each time they were prompt and their estimated completion times have been correct. our first install was on a honda pilot, next a gmc acadia denali, and the third was a hitch to my rx450h for our thule hitch mounted bike rack. each time i dropped off the suv's and left it there. i never found scratches, dirt, etc. upon return. we have never needed a truck rental nor moving boxes etc but if we ever do i will come to this location!"
1-star,0,worst costomer service ever.when i extended they authorized my credit card for expected total ($150) my balance was 108 and they expected me to pay it and wait for the authorization to fall off. the manager sabrina was absolutely no help said she couldnt hard charge the pending authorization but could put it on a promise to pay note for a $30 fee. i asked her to call costomer service and she refused. she said call myself. i said please dial it for me and finish helping me she said no she had other costomers. i rent a uhaul every other week til now
1-star,0,"this place is completely incompetent. i've been trying to get a trailer hitch installed so i can attach a bike rack for three weeks. every time you call you get rolled over to the call center and they try to answer questions and they have no idea what you're talking about. i finally went online and ordered the hitch. they make you pay for it 100% up front so they have you over a barrel because they already have your money. they ask you online to pick a day for install and then they say someone will call you to make the appointment on that day. no one called me, instead i received a text and an email saying that my appointment for my install is at 7:00am. this is fine but it's in saturday, the day i picked. but who wants to get up at 6am on their day off to get a hitch installed. but whatever. go early and get it over with right? so i drag myself out of bed at 6am saturday, drive the 10 miles to get there, wait in line with all of the other people with 7am appointments (they open at 7 so that's when the doors open and everyone arrives), and 15 mins later finally get to a cashier. i tell her i have a hitch appt and give her my name. she looks me up and says ok at 9 when the guy gets here he can do your hitch. at 9:00?!?!?! then why on earth did you schedule me at 7?!?!? so i showed her the text and the email. she said oh that's from the call center. we open at 7 but they guy isn't here until 9. then how come the email i got is signed by someone, ""sabrina mills"" from the decatur location with the decatur address and phone info? the email and text plain as both day say 7am. so i tell her that since i've already paid there's nothing i can do because they already have my money. so i'll now have to go home and come back. she asks if i'm gonna leave the vehicle. no. how can i leave the vehicle? i have to drive it home. so i drove the 10 miles back home where i am now sitting here writing this. and in an hour i have to get up again and drive the 10 miles back and waste more gas and more of my time on saturday for something that should be easy. my advice if you schedule an appointment there, call and make them transfer you and talk to someone there directly and verify your appointment. because apparently they don't really know what they are doing."
5-star,1,"if i had to deal with the woman who answered when i called, the review would not be good at all. she seemed rude over the phone. thankfully, we had the pleasure of dealing with, douglas s. upon arrival and curtis at the return dock. they are both first class people with first class customer service. very personable and friendly douglas is friendly and knowledgable of his job and we will be sure to look for him the next time we need a uhaul. once we left with the truck, i noticed the mileage in the truck was higher than what was logged by the technician. i immediately took a picture with my phone, called the office and explained the discrepancy. i was assured by douglas that it would all be worked out correctly when i returned the truck. curtis greeted me at the return docking station with a handshake and introduced himself. he made the corrections that needed to be made and did it a smile. this is the uhaul location we frequent because they always have vehicles. no need to run around or call different places. one stop shop here."
1-star,0,"took my vehicle here because of a bad hitch installation job that was done in san antonio. i called, made an appointment and came in. we get there stating that we have an appointment and the lady goes to find the technician. she advised us to step outside to greet the tech. he looked downright bothered to assist us. he looked at his phone, i assume to view the time and yes sir we were on time, and huffed. the lady then said to go back inside and he'll be with us shortly. we sat down in the waiting area and then noticed someone was out front looking at my car. so my fiancé and i walk out to greet them. another tech and the general manager were inspecting the hitch, thanks for saying hello folks and letting us tell you what our concerns are. my fiancé climbed under the car with the tech to explain our concerns. we went back in with the gm where she says ""yeah they shouldn't have trimmed the heat shield on the vehicle without your consent"" and ""contact repwest, our insurance, to file a claim and they'll take care of it."" i get a couple weeks later that the claim was denied because of the statements acquired from the gm at that location, sabrina. i called to speak with her and she didn't know what my next step should be. repwest told me to call her and she told me to call repwest. what a runaround. i asked if there was a number to corporate to talk to. she didn't know. i asked if i need to speak with someone higher up, she didn't know. she said she's never dealt with a denied claim before and didn't know what to do. i told her well today will be the day that she'll have to learn but she just said she had no recommendations. what kind of crappy general manager is that? there's always a customer service process and hierarchy. ""i don't know"" just doesn't cut it. word of advice... never ever have a hitch installed at uhaul. when they mess up they will do everything they can to avoid fixing it. it's been the worst experience of my life dealing with them and their insurance company for over 2 months straight."
1-star,0,"the guy that checked in my uhaul here was awful. i am never coming back nor recommending it to anyone. uhaul is such a big name brand too, what a horrible experience. where to start... the parking lot is a disorganized cluster of vehicles, there aren't any signs that tell you where to go upon arrival. i figured it out as i kept driving and assuming i was going the right way. the first guy i met didn't greet or say anything to me. i stood by the uhaul for a while before he approached me, still not saying a word but holding out his hand. while i reach in my bag for the paperwork, he takes the key out of my hand and opens the uhaul door. he says hello after i say hello with his head away from me in the vehicle. while huffing and puffing, he asks if i had any problems with the truck and i reply that it was all good except we couldn't get the light to stay on inside the truck. at that moment you would think i was his child because he began scolding me and telling me i didn't do it right. i don't know a lot about operating a uhaul light so i just said, ""ohhh ok. thank you""...and he continued to degrade and scold me while huffing and puffing and shaking his head. he then asks me if i even refilled the uhaul because it was short on gas. i showed him my 7/11 fuel receipt and explained that i filled it according to the level shown on the keychain. i still had 20 min left with the truck so not a big deal, i'd go back and fill it. i asked him how much it would be to fill it up there. he asks me again, ""did you even fill it up? where did you drive to?!"" at this point i got aggravated and answered his question with a little bit of an attitude but mid sentence, with no eye contact-head still in the van he yells at me to just go inside. as i'm walking in, he yells that i'm going the wrong way. i just kept walking. i had to get as far away from him and as quickly as possible. i was going to blow up. i had no idea where ""inside"" was and i sure as hell didn't deserve the hostility. i was relieved that the young lady inside was pleasant. she explained more on how to fill up and that i wasn't too far off to where the gauge needed to be. she told me not to worry about the remaining gas and sent me on my way. it took me a little bit to get over my frustration with the guy. i just felt it was unnecessary and moving is already frustrating enough. i get that it's hot in vegas and you're working and not having the time of your life, but if you're that miserable just do us all a favor and quit."
1-star,0,so i called uhaul to find out if the had bed covers that closed so i could store my box springs in storage. the person on the phone was great. sent my father to pick it up he brought it home opened the packaging and there was no closer called the store they explained bring it in because sometimes things can be messed up from manufacturers. i sent my dad back not there fault i didn't bring the receipt but the customer service there was horrible the customer service person said just because it says that it seals doesn't mean it really does. wtf what do you mean that just because it says it has a closure it really doesn't mean that. how does that make any sense. my father left the store brought back the mattress cover and was livid. so don't believe what they tell you or what the packaging says.. so when it comes down to it and you need packing needs go to another store i know i will...
1-star,0,"uhaul is a big name and carry a very useful product, that being said i have been here multiple times and they care very little about the customer. if they can add a charge or scam you they will do it. i dropped my trialer off in the designated location per our agreement. then i found out the manager was trying to charge me because he doesn't know the trailer was already in their yard. i dealt with the confusion on the phone, was supposedly resolved then weeks later they try and hit my credit card. and all of a sudden everyone has amnesia. i will be using penske or budget from now on. .. we have spent 10's of thousands with rental companies over the years and my experience with uhaul has been the worst. lousy customer forever."
1-star,0,"oh really u-haul. you guys have been charging my money from my bank everyday. it has been two weeks already. it's my hard make money too. but when i called, a lady said they couldn't help me about it. if you couldn't, who would help me about it?terrible terrible. people should consider well before starting a business with them."
1-star,0,"terrible customer service. was told over the phone to come in to get my truck inspected, get there and said i had to make an appointment. i asked to inspect my hitch and the man literally just drove by and said you need the ball and tried to sell it to me with out making sure it was the right one. employees yelling at each other. just a bad experience better to go some where else or a uhaul less ghetto."
2-star,0,"it started when i tried to drive on the lot only to have 2 men jump in front of my truck asking if i needed help. then to a service rep that definitely had no clue about customer service and to top it off, just because i am a woman don't treat me like an idiot. definitely won't be using this location again"
3-star,0,"recently moved to lv in a car. managed to find some good furniture deals, but many were not able to deliver- so yelp advised us to try uhaul. called around 12:45 and reserved a 10' truck for 1:30, quoted $20/day with a .69-cent per mile local rate. gave card over phone to reserve and it was ready when we went in. borrowed for a total of about 3 hours, did about 25 miles of damage picking up furniture at two places in henderson then dropping off at our home. added fuel prior to returning and they weren't too strict about it- received with 7/8ths tank, refilled to between 6/8 and 7/8ths and the guy originally brought it up and said there'd be a charge but backed off and said he'd take care of it when i whipped out a receipt. turning in the vehicle was just as easy as renting it. total came to $52 and change, not bad for what we did. i'd rather find a friend with a pick up truck next time- driving the truck was easier than expected but stressful. don't know how people drive them at a snail's pace across the country."
4-star,1,"i only came here for boxes.. so i'm not sure about ordering a truck or anything. i ordered the boxes online, and selected this location to pick them up. i ordered them at about 1 or 2 -- and when i got there at about 3:30 they hadn't set my boxes aside saying that the order or the payment had just went through. found that odd-- but they recovered quickly and picked out all my boxes and got me some help out. the store is clean- and they were all very polite. all in all it was a good experience! boxes are excellent quality and prices are the best i've seen during my search."
2-star,0,"this uhaul place was clean and for the most part organized. when you walk in the entrance, they have all their merchandise and boxes and moving supplies all organized and layed out and stuff however, the counter/register areas are all behind all the supplies and the supplies block the counter area. so you don't necessarily see the counter/employees when you walk in the door, you have to walk past the boxes/supplies. processing my paperwork/payment was fairly quick and easy. when i went outside to get my truck, the gas tank was empty. i wasn't pissed but i was very annoyed that it didn't match the paperwork and they left it empty. so i had to wait 10 min or so for them to go fill it up. when the guy gets back and i look at it, it's only 1/4 full. i was like what the freakin hell??? i go back inside to let her know so she can match up the paperwork again and i question this and ask why it's not filled up? she said 1/4 of a tank is the minimum they have to fill it. i said what if i have to do some real moving and stuff around town??? am i supposed to keep filling it to only a 1/4 of a tank since i know you don't reimburse/give credit back to the customer if it's over the amount given to us?? she apologized and just simply said that 1/4 is all they have to fill it to. luckily i was only picking up something at walmart that was too big for my car and that's all i needed the uhaul for, so i didn't use much gas or mileage but it's still ridiculous. #2, i had originally planned to pick up the uhaul pickup truck closest to the walmart that had my item and then drop it off at the location closest to my house (only making a 1 way trip) and they tell me i have to drop it back off at the location i picked it up at. just fyi!!!!!! it clearly says on their main page on their website and i quote... ""because u-haul has over 15,000 locations across the u.s. and canada, you'll be able to pick up equipment close to your origin and drop it off close to your destination."" it does not show an asterick or a note or stipulations or says only in town moves or anything restricting of any type. and i will be fighting this. and i want 1/2 my mileage at 59 cents per mile reimbursed to me."
5-star,1,"when my movers screwed me over at the last minute, i called u-haul. it was 7:30 on a friday night, and i was able to rent a 17-ft truck immediately. marshall was very helpful and friendly. in fact, when i returned the truck the next day, he remembered me and said that he hoped my move went well. the pricing is standard for truck rental, and it's convenient to have your final receipt e-mailed to you. i'll definitely go with this location/company again if i need to rent a truck."
4-star,1,"i've been to these guys before, i believe, moving within town. i know i have returned trucks here. i had to go to these guys twice, once to rent a 14' and then a few days later we went back to them for a 10' truck to move my g/f's things out. (my stuff was going to california. i know.) i got most of my things in boxes and had to simply get them out of our home so we could have room to pack the rest of the things. we lived in a 1 bedroom apartment, which to me was incredible in retrospect, near sahara and palace station. so many things i could do 24/7 within walking. oh, how i took that utopia for granted a mere 2 weeks later. reservations online were simple: pick a size, pick a location to pick up and pick destination, within or outside of town. most of the $20/ day trucks and minivans are only within town moves. put in a credit card and info and you pay when you pick up. most of the rentals (out of town) are calculated for 4 days. in fact, the only way i think you can do daily is within town. bam, the amount quoted (brought the printout just in case) was put on the card and away we go. so i go to pick up the truck with some harsh reminders on sahara. a lot of the auto dealerships are now empty lots with realtor signage and weeds growing from cracks in the cement. empty stores remain vacant. a chili's (where my g/f once saw flava flav) building days ago had been leveled and was a lot full of rubble and rebar. a red robin is now a habib's. funny how the national places close, only to be replaced by smaller ethnic businesses, which in turn become larger if they can survive til the market goes back up. i have to support the smaller, local businesses. still better than strip malls i've seen vacant in vegas for longer than the past 4 years when vegas was still ""booming."" i pull into the lot and there are a group of guys standing around whistling, trying to get my attention. day laborers. u-hauls bring out my best *sarcasm* since i want to pick up the truck when they open to get my full days worth, at 7:00am. so i'm waiting for a bit for them to set up inside. there's already a u-haul guy from the garage part walking around the front lot. what i notice on the front door is they have a chart with some guys names and rates, mostly around $15/ hour. these are the guys standing there across the street in the abandoned auto dealership. i think it's cool that they at least register, so they appear to be legally paid, it covers them and u-haul and us, i suppose. the next time i went, i saw an employee walk out across the street to distribute what looked to be paychecks or stubs or something. do my paper work inside, the people are friendly enough for that time of the morning, i was holding back sore muscle insomnia crankiness myself. i never understand boxes that u-haul and public storage (there's another review i have to do) sell. i went around, originally looking at auto zone, where i scored oil boxes before. but i made a major haul at the huge aqua colored recycling bin at lee's discount liquor (another review!). and if you use the plastic crates on the side as steps to get boxes, at least be respectful and put them back. so the truck is parked out front, running* where they let you do a pre inspection. it's important to point out every dent and let them put an ""x"" sticker on it, or they'll blame you for damage when you return the truck. check under the front where people run over things and the tire wells and the top corners for those attempting drive thru. she was cool about putting stickers on every little thing. and then you're off, they get you out of there pretty quick. *so i get home and take the key out of the ignition. was i groggy or was there not a buzzing? i spent the day trying to load, but it was over 110 degree heat. so i slept the rest of the day and then waited for my g/f to get home so she could sit in the back of the truck and watch it while i loaded it. i couldn't move the truck. the battery was dead because the lights had been on all day. the attendant put the lights on and didn't tell me. and i didn't know or think to turn them off. i had to sit in the open parking space next to the truck (and hold it, while answering all kinds of stupid questions from passersby) for my g/f to get home just to jump it. #fml! so check the lights when you get to your loading destination."
1-star,0,"$19.95 + mileage no deposit required for local moves. that's what they told me over the phone when i gave them my credit card # to reserve the truck. however when i showed up saturday morning to get my truck.. an entirely different story!! 1st they wanted to charge a $75 deposit to my credit card, then they said a $100 cash deposit & leave my car, then it was a $500 deposit/no car. wtf!?! i walked out without spending a dime because i felt if that much had changed what other suprises was i in for? buyer beware!"
1-star,0,"it's like customer service doesn't mean a thing to anyone anymore these days. called to get a little more information about a car, and the way the dealership does their financing - disgusted!! man on the phone was short, rude and had a nasty tone!! like excuse me for inquiring. won't be considering this place or recommending it anyone!! if they'll treat customers like that over the phone who knows how they're treating them in person or after the sale!!! think about it. don't waste your time here."
5-star,1,so i was looking for a inhouse finance car lot and i so happend to run across eriks adds on fb went to go look at what he had and lucky me i foumd a car in my budget and he made tje process simple thank you erik
5-star,1,i had an awesome experience at used car outlet great customer service and very friendly will definitely recommend others to purchase from here. no credit check! was in need for a car right away walked in and drove off the lot satisfied!
1-star,0,"this car lot is a big joke. i purchased a truck in june, 2017 only drove it 4 days. i understood it was sold as is car lot. but they knew they sold me a lemon. on the 3rd are 4th day the air conditioner compressor went out and the hose needed to be replaced. remind you i put 1500.00 down. they refused to help they said go get it fix and bring me the bill. at this point i could not afford to pay that,and pay them a car note. they give you a so called print out of the car that was supposed to be diagnosed by pep boys. it is all a hoax. eric was our salesmen,he is so full of shit! they picked up the car and had it towed to a shop.they refuse to give me any of my money back,are try to work with me in any kind of way. we will see them court. there is a lemon law. rip off!! remember the printout is a bullshit printout."
5-star,1,"if you need help buying a reliable car, go see kevin, john and erick at used car outlet. these guys have been in the business for a long time and can help almost anyone. no credit check, simple terms and affordable used cars. if you need to start over or just starting out, they can assist you. my son needed a car, but had no credit and little down. he drove off with a nissa versa in great condition, with low payments and a short term. i highly recommend them!!"
5-star,1,best car buying experience ever. if you are looking for a cheap reliable car this is the spot. when they said no credit check they mean it. saw there ad on craigslist went in and looked around the lot found a clean g20. told them about my situation and they worked with me to get a deal with no pressure at all. they were upfront about down payments and monthly payments what would work. best part is the whole process only took about an hour half only because insurance company took long. i will always return to this location as well as refer people here. no other place like this thank you guys at used car outlet.
5-star,1,"great guys working here! first time here at 8:30am on a saturday and it was such an easy experience. drove right in and they got me all set. got an oil change and tire rotation, which took about 45 minutes for both. the guys were friendly and worked quickly - they even fixed my dented hubcap without me asking. would definitely recommend this location. they're professional and welcoming, with all of your typical greaser charm (and i mean that in the most endearing way). they have coupons on their website, which saved me $10!"
4-star,1,"nice speedy oil change, very friendly people working there. they were out of stock of the air filter i needed so i have to get that replaced elsewhere. they were a little expensive for me, but i think it's because i'm used to the super discount places."
5-star,1,"great service! quick in and out. the technicians were friendly and explained everything including any charges for additional work. i'll be back in 3,000 miles!"
5-star,1,"the folks there were a solid group who knew their business and got the job done quickly and professionally. they knew what the car needed, topped everything off, adjusted tires, etc. went above and beyond and were very quick. i would most certainly go back again."
5-star,1,"fast, efficient, and did a great job. i used a foursquare check-in to get $5 off my conventional oil change. i recommend these guys."
5-star,1,"these guys were great. they went above and beyond. not only did they change my oil super quickly, but they fixed a lose hose that was causing gas fumes to leak into the cabin, gave me advice on how to deal with a frozen wiper sprayer and cleaned out the remains of a nest that some animal had built. they even put on my new license plates (i had just come from the dmv). top notch service."
5-star,1,"adulthood and responsibilities have brought me to the lifestyle of the constant oil change. or maybe it's still having a car from the 90's and wanting to make sure my beater car runs as well as it possibly can. yeah, the latter. i've recently found a oil change location that i trust and that is valvoline instant oil change off of university avenue in madison. not to be confused with their many other locations, while the other ones i've used have a friendly staff, this spot has a knowledgeable and direct staff (friendly too, of course). i can't remember the guy's name (steve maybe?) but he's been there both times i've gone in and he tells me what my car needs and what i can go without for a while. plus, they aren't shy about discounts - bring your receipt back, write a review, check in on foursquare - all of these are easy ways to make your visit more affordable. oh, and if you go regularly, they sometimes give you a 15% discount card to be used on your next visit. their hours are actually somewhat convenient too - open until 6pm monday thru friday, plus saturday and sunday hours? bonus! i think i got there at 5:45 one night and had to wait about 15 minutes to get in (just a little after they officially closed), but they still spent the time to service my vehicle and were just as pleasant as usual. professionals, that's what you'll get here."
1-star,0,"i got a chrome delete done to my jeep grand cherokee. the quality of work was good. however the quality of customer service by ""sheets"" was complete garbage. guy yelled and cursed me out when i asked him for a revised quote because his team couldn't remove the door handles off of my vehicle to delete the chrome. he instead tried to sale me on tinting my taillights. he got upset because i told him i thought the taillights tint for $150 was too expensive and rather have the door handles removed from my original $700 quote. he told me to ""come pick up my s***"". ""sheets"" is a complete nightmare to work with and i would never recommend anyone to visit warrior wraps. front office staff was good. but dealing with ""sheets"" who makes the final decision on what to charge customers is unacceptable to work with."
5-star,1,"had my van wrapped here, great job. graphics were done in one day. was asked to give them 3 days to complete the job, got a call that the van was ready a day early. very happy with the results."
5-star,1,could not be happier with the service and product. they were very prompt when scheduling service. the staff on the phones when i called were super helpful and answered all my questions. when the guys came out to measure the walls and vehicle they were very professional. very quickly they had proofs for me to approve. we made changes and within no time they were back at out business to install. they sent two installers to make the job fast and they did an amazing job. i had two huge walls covered inside our business and two large banners installed on our vehicle. highly recommended!
5-star,1,sheets was awesome and getting my logo made for wrapping a shuttle. came in to get installed and guys were great. highly recommend for any wrapping needs.
1-star,0,i was driving to work this morning and their work truck cut everyone off last minute. this was on the 15 before tropicana. good looking truck. asshole driver. would never give a person like this business.
5-star,1,amazing!! they did such a great job. the process was very quick and alicia made sure things were moving along. they listened to what i was looking for and made it a reality. i'm very happy with the wrap. thank you everyone!
5-star,1,i wanted a partial hood wrap done on my custom jeep . my buddy dan from devious designs referred me to warrior wraps as i didn't want to experiment with just anyone on my jeep . alicia in sales answered all of my questions . i was extremely satisfied with the results and i would recommend warrior wraps to my friends and family . great service / incredible work . thanks again .
5-star,1,"warrior wraps is a top notch business and they do amazing work in a very fast manner. i had another company make promises they could not keep and warrior wraps saved the day! let's start with the service. the front desk staff are very polite. answered the phone with a smile i could hear and did everything they could to assist me over the phone. i walked in the back parking lot and was greeted by an installer than really knew his stuff and have great recommendations and reasonable pricing for my car. i wanted my front lip, side mirrors, and spoiler wrapped black. i expected it to be a long turn around time however i was able to get my car serviced the same day. who does that anymore? great stuff. from start to finish warrior wraps saved the day and when i decide to get my side stripes and tires done they will be the first i call."
5-star,1,"use warrior wraps repeatedly and they always do a great job with our equipment! extremely proficient,timely and detailed! i would highly recommend warrior wraps and when you call ask for corey to come out and take care of you! he always gets the job done right the first time and is very knowledgable about his work. professional and detail oriented, with him on the job our wraps turn out great! wouldn't go anywhere else! nice work corey very much appreciated!"
5-star,1,"these guys are experts in what they do and it shows. they were friendly, helpful and professional at getting my project done on time and done right. thank you and a+ job!"
5-star,1,"so this is the place to go to when you want a good wrap or decals on your vans,trucks,cars,work trucks, campers anything you want,they can do it ...they can handle anything you put before them . they're very professional and do an extremely professional job and are willing to go to the extra mile to make sure you're happy . i didn't have any hassle or problems everything was simplified and verified me before the work was done.. the time that it takes to do the job was very quick considering my time frame for the day... i had one small problem and wanted to change something, and i knew it was going to cost me... and no problem they took care of it, and changed the way i liked it,and everything came out awsome... these are people to come to when you want anything done with the guarantee you won't leave unhappy i highly recommend this place to anyone that is wanting this kind of work done for your business or personal deals... no matter what it is they can handle it.. i will be bringing all of my work vehicles back here to be taken care of they have definitely earned my trust for my business...amazing carpet and tile cleaning"
5-star,1,i had my vw cc wrapped dec 15. it has been a great experience having this new look! i get people stopping me all the time to ask about my car and where i got it done. i would recommend warrior wraps 100%!!! you will love the new look too.
5-star,1,absolutely love sarah her customer service is superb!!! she goes above and beyond from beginning to end to make sure you're satisfied. been going to warrior wraps for a long time and she's always been great. i can't leave out percy his designs are amazing!!! you have to check him out.
1-star,0,"awful with customer service. i called on the telephone to inquire about a couple of jobs. they took all the information they needed and said someone (a female) would get back to me. never received a call. i went in person the following day. someone took measurements but said the office manager would be in touch with me. again, she never did. my girlfriend, who wants to have her entire 4runner wrapped, had similar experience and feels the same way. she had warned me that they never got back to her but thought i would have a better experience. seems they don't need or want anymore business."
5-star,1,these guys exceeded my expectations. from the time i got my quote to the time i picked up was only about a week. i brought my 2017 camaro ss here to get it murdered out with a matte black. sarah and her team went right to work and took care of everything from the side mirrors to the door handles. it looks amazing. i'm very happy with the work they did.
1-star,0,"one star review... called this place because i saw it driving. i was debating on getting my ferrari wrapped here instead of having it wrapped in cali and then transporting it here... i called and asked the girl that answers the phone: ""do you do color changes?"" her answer: what is that? i said well i don't want advertising i just want the car to be white instead of black. she said yes we do that. good i say, can you give me a price quote for a ferrari 458, i know price matters depending on color and wrap choice? she then says i can't quote anything until i look at the car. i then explained that i'm buying the car in cali and have gotten quotes from many reputable shops there, impressive wrap and also pfs in orange county. she then rudely goes : "" bring the car"". um ok whatever... impressive wrap which is a huge franchise and pfs when i called them both were very helpful informative and let me know at least a price range and told me what colors and shades could cost. i tried to keep my high end wrap business here locally but apparently they can't answer simple questions... definitely will not be taking my ferrari here lol"
5-star,1,warrior wraps wrapped my bmw 135i in white satin with red accents. car came out perfect. all of the team members were extremely professional and friendly and i got a great price! definitely recommend them!
5-star,1,i use warrior wraps for all of my corporate wraps and clings. they are fast and efficient. all of their installations come out amazing. their graphic installer corey is amazing. very detail oriented and friendly. i never have to worry about the quality when he is around.
5-star,1,these guys are awesome ! great work! only company i use for my wrap needs. if your looking for high quality work at reasonable prices stop by warrior wraps ask for lyndsey
5-star,1,"this company is the best! sarah and the whole team was amazing, quick and helpful. wrapped my unit and it looks amazing!!! thank you!!!"
5-star,1,warrior wraps did an awesome job on my truck. they did a wrap on the roof and front end. came out perfect and has held up really good. would definitely recommend for anyone to use.
5-star,1,first time using this company they were excellent. sent two installers to wrap some of our charging stations. they did an excellent job very professional and friendly look forward to using them again in the future. big thanks to corey and tre they did a great job.
5-star,1,"these guys are super cool, and will help you with whatever you can imagine for a design on your car. even if you know cars or just started they will take car of you! highly recommended. sarah is awesome and always nice by the way. great service."
5-star,1,"been to warrior wraps twice to customize my 15 kia soul. great job very professional and i'm not quite done yet. ""i'll be back""."
5-star,1,i've been coming here for the past 6 months for work and sarah is always so helpful!! it makes my day when i get to see her smiling face!!
5-star,1,"wonderful service, and sarah at the front desk was extremely helpful. they wrap your car in record time, and offer you free snacks and netflix while you wait! i highly recommend this place!"
1-star,0,"this place is terrible. please save your money and go else where. first my friend wanted to wrap his car and had to put a deposit down, normal. after deciding be no longer wanted to do it, he asked for his deposit and they told him they would give him store credit not money. this is their policy. second i bought credit from my friend and has them wrap the roof on my brand new car (from the dealership) when i got my car back the car was dented and the wrap looked bad. they did not take responsibility for the damage but they did say they would re do the wrap. after getting the dents out i retuned (foolish me) they wrapped my roof again but the unprofessional workers they have did not wash off the tree sap that was sitting on top of the car (basic instruction clean surface before applying) . the wrap was wayyyy worse than before. i was so frustrated with this company i took the wrap off myself and took the loss on my money. if i were to go back i know for a fact they wouldn't take responsibility like the fist time. this place is over priced. i only went there because my friend couldn't get his money back. same wrap anywhere else would have been 150$ with them 250$ don't do it!!!"
5-star,1,"i have done $thousands$ in business here and they always take care of me! mike, sara and percy are awesome! they don't use cheap material like other shops. i will be back again soon for more work."
5-star,1,i'm so grateful this company was recommended to me. i experienced amazing and helpful customer service as well as quick design and installation. if possible i would rate them 6 stars. ask for sarah and percy for your graphic design needs.
2-star,0,"how do i even start. the customer service there is terrible. the design engineers rarely get back to you when emailed questions,. for example: they they told us they will send one more drawing to get the final approved and we never received it...also, they offer no help on ideas and once the wrap is on the vehicle, ""that's it"" if u don't like it to bad. when my wife and i showed up to pick up the vehicle we noticed a few mess ups and when the lady at the front desk came out to look at it w us she said "" once u approve the design, that's what u get"" well the design of what they sent us that we approved was different then what was on the car. but too bad. that's what we get. don't waste ur time w this place. go somewhere else, cause again she even said that they try not to give any suggestions .. but they are the experts. they should be helping us and giving us pointers and such"
5-star,1,"after dealing with the rude and nasty clerks of the surprise dmv on multiple occasions, this place was a pleasure. short wait, nice people who were efficient and knew what they were doing. i never want to go back to the surprise dmv!"
4-star,1,to put it simply they are way faster than waiting at dmv. they are better skilled in customer service and they take care of you as best they can. i would say try this first for titles or licences.
5-star,1,"so much easier than the dmv! i needed an arizona license as my ohio on was expiring. they have 2 sections, one for licenses and one for registration and tags so there is a nice flow to everything. it's about $20 more than the dmv but it it so worth it. clean and very quick!"
5-star,1,best kept secret. no lines esp in the middle of the week. friendly staff. have your act together and you'll be in and out of here easily and quickly.
5-star,1,i was expecting to walk into long lines and poor service. i was disappointed. i walked in to be the only customer and the staff was really friendly and nice. totally not what i was expecting. i changed my license in about 20 minutes. i can say this is my first pleasant dmv/mvs experience. great job guys!
1-star,0,"the lady i've now seen twice has been an absolute nightmare to deal with. hey make it absolutely impossible to get an arizona license. i have a colorado license and was able to legally change my name after getting married. they wouldn't take a marriage license over a certificate even though i produced 5 other documents. i'm appalled at this minute issue and lack of help. i came back with my ""certificate"" like they asked, and they are giving me a hard time about it! spent an hour waiting for them to fax, twice now, to the state to see if it qualifies. oh yea, faxing didn't work, so they are scanning it now!"
5-star,1,one of the better branches for the dmv. it is kept very organized and moves pretty quickly. there is also a machine in the back that lets you do most things on your own like renewing your license. the hours have changed during the weekdays and so it actually closes at 5pm not 6pm
5-star,1,"i went to the office in the hopes it would keep me from a lengthy time standing (i am somewhat disabled). the office has a handicap parking spot right at the door. a number system (take a number). plenty of seating and i had my eye exam, my picture taken, and my paperwork completed in 20 minutes total. i left with a temporary renewal license. the clerk was friendly, efficient and helpful. beats going to mvd and the convenience fee is well worth it. i was at the surprise location."
5-star,1,"the staff is very efficient and friendly. the extra charge is well worth not standing in line for hours at the dmv. charges are well displayed and explained. comfortable setting, plenty of chairs were available when we were there. i will continue to use their services."
1-star,0,stay as far away from this place as you can go. they had no idea how to properly register my vehicle and gave me some erroneous information that caused me to waste my time. one star rating is way to high for this place. i ended going to another third party az mvd place at 98th avenue/bell road- quik stop and everything went flawless. one star is way to high
5-star,1,"always a great experience here, showed up before 8. the part that impressed me maybe the most is on a monday morning the workers working their way in the front door to be to work on time were polite and cheerful as they entered. that carried on through my transaction. they expanded to a comfortable second suite with more employees seating and water. i know the folks at the dmv do their best but this place is a model for how things should be ran. cost me $5 extra for my transaction which was better than going to wickenburg or 51st ave and bell."
5-star,1,this place is great and fast! somehow i stumbled upon it after trying to visit the surprise dmv which had people lined up out the door for hours. there is a small convenience fee but well worth the time you save not waiting at the dmv.
5-star,1,"wow! i was in and out after transferring my title and renewing registration! total of 13 minutes! thought for a moment i was getting ""punked"" or something. haha seemed to good to be true. well it started off by my letting my work now that i had to run to the dmv and i would be returning in about a hour to a hour and a half. just thought that was the norm for these types of places. i pull up to the dmv next to the sheriffs office and realize the wait was absolutely re-donkulous! out the damn door!! are you serious!! ugh!! so i searched title places on yelp and would you know there was one literally right down the dang street from the dmv! i figured with a wait like this i had nothing to lose and everything to gain at this point. i pull up to west valley motor vehicle and don't notice a line out the door! this is a great sign. i walk in there was one individual a head of me. i kid you not i was in and out of the place in less than 20 mins. long story long... i return to work way earlier than i or anyone else for that matter expected! put me in a good mood all day! thank the heavens for west valley motor vehicle!!"
5-star,1,"omg! finally, i don't have to go to a stinky, sweat encrusted, dirty dmv to renew my registration or transfer a title! if any of you have ever had a bad experience going to the dmv and gotten the run around...stop going there! courteous, knowledgeable, and most of all friendly staff and no waiting for hours on end! that's right ladies and gents, i said no waiting! all i did was walk in explained what i needed and voila...done! seriously, why go to the crappy dmv where you have to deal with disgruntled employees when you can actually get good customer service?! (yes, it does exist!) check them out and give them your business. i guarantee you will leave with a smile on your face! :)"
5-star,1,"wheels in motion goes above and beyond to help out their customers! july 2017 i was in an accident that totaled my car which left me, a young first-year teacher who just moved to arizona, without a car. i looked at many different dealerships in the west and east valleys, but wheels in motion stood out for their honesty, customer service and car quality. the employees at wheels in motion were incredibly kind, informative and helpful during my first-time car buying experience. that same week i was able to walk out with a 2008 honda cr-v at an affordable price! it has now been 11 months since i bought the car. my ac stopped working, so i went to wheels in motion for help. scott, tim and david were all incredible. they remembered me as a customer and immediately took my car to their mechanic. scott understood my situation and took complete care of me by splitting the cost to fix my ac and giving me a car to use while my car was being fixed. this is what excellent customer service looks like. did they have to help me? no. but they did! i will be buying all future cars from this dealership and urge everyone to go see wheels in motion!"
5-star,1,raymond and scott are very professional. they make buying a car easy. they were straight forward through out the process and did everything they said they would to help me and my family get the car we wanted. they have very nice cars at very great prices . i highly recommend them to anyone and i will definitely be back .. i would give them a 10 star rating if i could.. thanks again to all at wheels in motion auto sales.
5-star,1,the staff was friendly and very tolerant of the screaming devil toddlers i had with us. elf was very friendly and good with the kids! ray got us a great deal with a great interest rate. looking forward to doing business in the future.
5-star,1,"i looked for a honda element for six months before finding the perfect one at wheels in motion. i was nervous because i've only worked with new car dealerships over the last decade, but honda doesn't make elements anymore, so used it had to be. all i can say is that i should have been working with these guys all along. they were straightforward, not pushy, upfront, helped me find great financing, gave me a great deal on my trade-in, and the mechanic that i hired to go check out the car liked them as well. such a better experience than new car dealerships - totally unexpected yet grateful. elf runs a quality business and i highly recommend them."
5-star,1,had one of the best car buying experience i ever had today! customer service was on point explained everything in layman's terms test-drove went great and the buying process was less than half an hour! all the staff were extremely professional and easy to talk to especially scott aka. . . .the elf
5-star,1,"we had a wonderful experience today! after driving all around phoenix yesterday and wasting time, we had a great, honest and easy truck buying experience with ray, scott and tim! thank you so much and we would refer our friends to you all! thank you!"
3-star,0,"at first i had a great experience and this was my first time buying a car and it was simple and easy and i was a pleased customer. then comes the date of my temporary tags expiration and i haven't received my new license plate, so i drove back down to the dealership which is an hour drive from where i live and they told me i had to fill more paper work out. well why wasn't i contacted sooner? and why didn't they get filled out the initial time of purchase? so i brushed that off and larry, the one who sold the car told me that they would send in the paperwork and i should receive my license in the mail within 2-4 days. it has been one month since that last visit and here i am again at the dealership having to get a copy of my temp plate again. the worker said that they will have the owner tim work on my problem as soon as he comes in monday and that someone will deliver it to me personally, so it's a waiting game now."
1-star,0,"went into dealership today to hopefully take home a car that seemed great online. everything was great until the test drive. the check engine light and abs warning lights came on. the salesman seemed surprised when we came back and told him. however, the owner yelled from his office that he was having it looked at on monday. why would you show a car, let alone let a customer drive a car, knowing warning lights are on. very dissapointing."
4-star,1,"hi to anyone looking to buy a good value pre-owned car in the valley. i bought a pre-owned 2008 aspen suv from wheels in motion & please read the entire review. at first i was impressed with the condition of the car, it was 95% of i would say, "" show room "" condition in appearance. the suv really looked good & was well taken cared of. it did have some miles on it but again it was in great shape. i bought the car after a test drive for 15 minutes & on the next day there was a problem, as can be expected with a pre-owned car but not so fast, lol. but here in lies the reason to buy a car & work w/this with this dealership. the car virtually shut down on the first day of owning it & needless to say i was really annoyed. i called the salesperson who helped me, perry, & left a vm in the evening @about 9:30pm. the call was returned w/in 10 minutes & so began what i feel was an impressive response by this dealership. the next day the owner, tim, contacted me & told me he would come by my home to pick up the car personally & address any issue it had. tim was on time & very polite as well as understanding. he took the car to a local firestone repair center & they worked on it for two days to track down the problem which turned out to be a loose connection w/in the cars computer ( which could have happened @any time.) now i had also purchased a warranty for the car which would have covered this but wheels in motion paid for the repair needed out-of -pocket. this suv ( which is a second car ) now runs fine & has no other problems so far. i will post a second review in 1/2 months on the suv again. my point though is this. most pre-owned cars are going to have issues, we all know that. but this dealership & it's owner ( and perry ) were very pro-active in helping me & rectifying the issue. we all want to buy a car from someone who is honest & stands behind what they sell...wheels in motion certainly did this & i would suggest that if you are in the market for a pre-owned car give them a call & see if they can provide you with what you are looking for. i have been in sales for 30 years & one thing i can really appreciate is a business that stands behind what they sell. wheels in motion, tempe certainly met & surpassed my expectations as to how promptly & professionally they handled my situation. i would recommend this dealership."
1-star,0,"if i could leave less than one star i would do so. first off, i don't usually go out of my way to just leave a bad review about places because stuff happens. however, when you waste my money and my time then something should be said. i called originally to find out how much and when they could do my truck tinting. linda said she would give me a call back after getting all my information. well one day later i give a call back and linda said she forgot. ok it happens, so i booked an appointment for a week out because it was their earliest. so i took the day off to be home so i can wait for these guys to show up. i called 5 times 2 days before the appointment, 5 times the day before the appointment and not a single answer or call back. the day of i called 5 more times through out the day with no answer or call back. i finally get ahold of them 4 hours after my appointment and linda says she called to confirm but i didn't answer or call back so they cancelled it. i had no missed calls or messages left on my phone, also the fact that i had called regardless all day but no one answered. she apologized and said she would she if she could do something and would call me back. two hours later still nothing so i called back and she said she hadn't called back because they weren't going to be able to come back for another week. i hung out and scheduled with another company. this place is a joke and save your time and money."
1-star,0,"had this company do my home tint installation. do not trust this company, terrible, dishonest and left my house a mess. never again..."
1-star,0,"do not do business with this company if you value your time! they totally no-showed on me and would not answer my phone calls or texts. rude and unprofessional. i chalk it up to just another shady business run by amateurs. they did my sons car 2 months ago, and already the tint is pealing in the corner. tried calling....same thing, no answer or reply. shady!!!"
1-star,0,"linda is the worst!!!! i scheduled an appointment for between 8 and 9 am. we tried calling before 8 am to try and confirm our appointment, but to no avail. i wasn't unit after 8 that we were finally able to confirm our appointment, because no one would answer our call. about five minutes before 9 we called again to see where they were because i had an appointment at 11:30. linda then continues to yell and talk over me telling me she will not make her tech rush in order to finish my car, because it takes two hours. never once did i ask her to rush, but then again asses make assumptions. by this point she had already cancelled our appointment without my permission. the truth of is is if her tech had been here on time this never would have been an issue. then she tells us if we reschedule she'll have to charge us the full price, but never gave us a reason as to why. worst possible person you could have as the face of you business. what's crazy is this isn't the first poor review linda has personally received."
1-star,0,"i saw superior window tintings ad online for $69 tint. i have an old beater that is a daily driver but it doesn't have any tint so i figured for $69 how could i go wrong, even if it starts to peel or bubble after a year it's not bad at $69. i called and spoke with linda and made arrangements to have someone come out to my home the next day at 4:30 - 5 pm and was told that there was an additional trip fee but the total would be $100 for any shade including the window stripe. the next day came and went, i was at home waiting for the tinter to show up and nothing. i tried calling and texting linda with no answer. i left a voicemail and no call was returned. i began to do a search online to see if there was a home office or anywhere that i could call to see what was going on and found that this is a home based business and the only number associated is the cell phone. i called the following day and left another voicemail with no answer. update: today is 5 days after the no show and i called back from a different number and linda magically answered. when i told her who i was and that the tech did not show up nor call she said ""i think they got into a car accident that day, let me check and see what's on the schedule and i will call you back"". no call was returned, based on my experience with this business i would not recommend using them because if their business is operated in this way what does that say about their product? i would recommend dans window tinting, he is fast and does a great job!"
1-star,0,"linda is a piece of work!!! called the day before. appointment was scheduled for 10-11am. the next day i called in to confirm my appointment at 830. everything was set to go! at 11 no one had shown up yet, so i called.. they are stuck in ""traffic"". noon, still no one, so i called again.. ""let me call them and see where they are, i will call you back"". at 12:30 i had to call her and she said they will be a while and that she was sick of me calling her so she went ahead and just canceled my apt for me. bitch, i just want the truth and to know what is going on.. apparently they don't want my money. i guess i should have read these reviews first!"
1-star,0,"called twice for a quote then the third time they answered and tried scheduling an appointment but they said they would return my call, they never called so i had to call them back the next day . finally made an appointment after the fourth try, waited around for them no call, no show. lost two customers, very unprofessional."
1-star,0,"similar story as the others. had an appointment. time for the appointment arrived and... nothing. texts went unanswered. called 30 minutes after appointment time and was told that they tried to call to confirm and since i didn't answer, the appointment was cancelled. i double checked my phone before posting this. no missed calls from them. no messages. no texts. oh well. was really hoping to post something nice when things went well. sadly, they didn't. really don't understand why a company wouldn't just be honest. running behind? workers didn't show up? no problem! just call. anything but making it sound like it was my fault! grrrr."
1-star,0,this place is the worst. after waiting around for 4 hours after they scheduled me they finally showed up. the lady i spoke to on the phone was very very rude and couldn't care less about a customer. also 1 car for $69 is a lie and so is 2 full for$79 a piece. it's like $120 a vehicle. every single window had bubbles in it and i can't get them to fix it i am so frustrated! i am now out $250 and my tint looks like a 10 year old attempted it for the first time
1-star,0,"i scheduled an appointment for 5:30 they did not show up. i have called several times and received no answer. finally got in contact with linda who stated when you made the appointment i put you down on the schedule and the next day you were supposed to call back and let me know you wanted me to come. i stated i made an appointment for 5:30 to which she replied you did but they did not get your confirmation. i asked why she stated she put it in but for some reason they didn't get it. she then stated she called me at 11:00. i asked her what number she called and she placed me on hold and stated that she did not have my number. i asked her what my address was and she didn't have that either. i asked her when i gave her the information on yesterday what did she do with it. she advised she put it in the system but is not sure what happened to it. i stated let me get this straight i requested an appointment you gave me a time of 5:30 and you obtained the year, make and model of the car. the next question you asked was my phone number and address which i provided and you put in the system as well. you then made it a point to tell me at least 4 times cash only. then the next day when you did not show up i called several times from my phone and received no answer. when i used someone else's phone you picked up on the first ring and then stated that you did not have a confirmed appointment for me because i did not call the same day although i called the day before to make the appointment. you then stated you did confirm the appointment with me and sent it in but the guy didn't get it. you then stated you were not at work that morning to see if he did get it. you then stated you called at 11:00 but can't tell me what number you called because my information is not in your system. she stated it wasn't her fault. i asked her whose fault was it. she said i don't know, but would i like to make an appointment? this company is very unprofessional. don't waste your time. additionally i mentioned my issue with this company to someone else and they stated that a few saturdays ago they had them waiting and they called and she said the guy was in traffic. another hour passed she called back and stated he could be there in two hours. after the two hours they called back and received no answer. after they used a different phone linda answered and stated that she needed to reschedule the appointment because they guy came and no one answered the door. they advised they were sitting on their front porch the entire time due to a community garage sale going on and no one came. i have used this company twice in the past and have never dealt with linda before. i am not sure what has happened in the last two years but don't waste your time. linda is ruining your business!!!"

1-star,0,buyer beware!!! http://phoenix.craigslist.org/evl/fod/4373828582.html i set 2 separate appointments with linda. both times they cancelled last minute as i called them to find out where they were. both times they stated traffic problems. mind you my appointment times were 1030-11 and both times i had called the day before to confirm. linda stated she was there 7 days a week 8am-8pm yet i had to call several times to get her to answer and never did she call me back. the time they wasted was worth 10 times the amount of the service!!! i have filed complaint with bbb
1-star,0,"typical used cars, typical used car salesman willing to say anything to put high mileage hunk of crap in your driveway, and an underpaid, smells like he's homeless tweeker to cap off your shopping experience. by far the crappiest car lot on cave creek."
1-star,0,"what a joke! so i see an suv on craigslist listed in the for sale by owner section, sounds good on paper, so i call the number. phone is not answered as if it were a business, just simple ""hello"". i ask questions and what i am told and in the manner led me to believe that i was speaking to the owner who had owned it a long time. i get the address and when i get there it is a car lot with a lot of cars sitting around missing hubcaps and bad paint. i am there so i look at the car. pos! cars has been spot painted at least three times, there was not even a matching pair of tires on it, four different brand tires! i hear the whole sales bs and get talked into driving it.....transmission was shot, was told it just needs some fluid, has a little leak. yes it did have a leak, but the transmission fluid was burnt! engine has a faint lower end noise. all the time the sales person is telling me bs even after i mention that i am a ase master tech."
5-star,1,"i had called on a car thinking it was a private party & got there only to realize it was a dealership. wasn't happy, however i figured since i was already there i may as well look. i was sooo pleasantly suprised!! i had been to egypt & back (slight exaggeration) over the past few weeks dealing with jokers ( no exaggeration) trying to find a car for my daughter that i thought it would never happen. long story longer, i was treated right and we are very happy. dont get me wrong, this place isnt the taj majal, but if your looking for a deal and aren't we all, you'll find one with no bs"
5-star,1,i purchased a car from here. was very happy with the service from the owner. mike. i received a great deal. i looked on kelly blue book and craigs list and was very happy to know i was on the lower end of the price for the car that i purchased. i would buy here again. i will be sending my friends to buy here.
1-star,0,this place is a small car lot that promises whole sale auto prices. they advertise fake cars as private sellers just to get you to come in and upsell you. a major scam! avoid like the plague! it may not be the same company as listed here but its the same address. i hope this review saves somebody the time and hassle of going out there for nothing because this guy is a scammer.
