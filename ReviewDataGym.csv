Star Rating,Nature of Rating,Review Comment
1-star,0,"i was really excited to try a fun workout routine that would also do some damage. i showed up with a friend and two other girls who had made a reservation like the groupon specified. well imagine our surprise when the trainer wasn't there. we made contact with him and he said to ask another trainer to get us started and he would be there soon. you should know now, that he never showed up. secondly, the other trainer is technically a part of anther company that shares the garage. so the poor guy was stuck with clients that didn't even pay for his services. but he was willing to keep us busy with running drills, a little weights and such, but nothing boxing related. (again not his fault) he was great. but i definitely returned my groupon because the 1on1 boxing instructor definitely didn't bother to honor his own conditions. i even called him the next day to confirm that he would be there and he said of course he would. so i mentioned that i was a part of the group from that morning when he didn't show up and he said ""oh...well you were trained by (other trainers name)."" i thought that was a poor excuse."
2-star,0,"i was interested in taking a boxing bootcamp class, did some research and found 1on1. their pricing is reasonable, they offer monthly memberships, and they have multiple classes a day. the workouts are tough, usually there's a combination of boxing, circuit training, and crossfit type stuff. the regulars who go to the class i went to were fun and made it a good time. so why only 2 stars? when i started, our classes were ran by a young woman name amy. maybe it's just a style of training, but she always seemed completely disinterested or preoccupied with something else. then a new trainer came, justin, and he was much more involved and encouraging during the workouts. he listened to our feedback, modified the class occasionally to meet certain needs, showed us beginner versions of the exercises, etc. he was present and attentive. he'd throw in the occasional ""good job"" or ""you're improving"" along with the ""push harder"". those types of details make the mentally/physically tough workouts something you keep coming back to. but something happened. justin stopped working there and it was back to amy. and it was worse than before, she would run the class but be on her phone the whole time. or she'd leave the room when we were doing a timed exercise and she'd have the timer! there were also those days where she would not play any music because she didn't want to listen to the radio. i'd especially look forward to the days when she'd tell us she designed that day's workout to make us throw up and proceed to sit on her butt the entire class on her phone texting/talking. she'd usually let us know that when she was training, she'd do what we were doing but 3x as hard, blah blah blah blah. i didn't realize all of this wasn't ""normal"" until i started at another boxing gym in the valley. when i decided to not return they had started with a new trainer for the bootcamp class. he seemed to be running the bootcamp class and some other classes at the same time, so he was stretched thin. perhaps the same thing happened with justin. anyway, i didn't stay to find out."
4-star,1,i worked out at 1 on 1 boxing for a bout 6 months and i loved it! the pricing is reasonable although they really should offer a punch card for people who do other types of fitness and won't get much out of the unlimited plan. they switch out their workouts and always keep you guessing. the workouts are challenging and i saw a significant difference in my body after only 2 months. if you've never tried boxing i highly recommend it. it's a great alternative to regular cardio/weight training. i'd still be there right now but w/o air conditioning it's way too hot. i plan to return in the fall though
4-star,1,"this place literally kicked my butt every. single. time. i actually dreaded/hated working up the nerve to go back, but was soooo glad every single time after class. i had the livingsocial deal (unlimited month), which is pretty great deal, considering an unlimited month is $99. yelp offers a deal to help out as well. i like how every workout is different, and you really do see results fast. there's a new instructor now, and i feel like the classes are more conditioning/less boxing. kinda made me feel like buying my boxing gloves was not worth it (btw, go to sports chalet for the best deal on gloves/wraps - aside from amazon!) for new-goers: go a bit early to your first class to sign-in, wrap up, and run your 1/2 mile warm up. the gym is randomly in this little office-complex like place, in the south-east corner. you can't see the door from the street, so make sure you look at the signs for the suite #; from the entrance, make a left and head to the back corner. i recommend going to the 6pm class if you can, as there are others to work out with. don't be worried about looking like a newb - there were lots of regulars, that have been doing bootcamp for years, and they were still struggling. they really work you hard!"
5-star,1,great place to work out! jerry has been great with the kickboxing skills! he makes sure you are safe and still getting a good workout. i leave drenched in sweat every time!
4-star,1,"although i wouldn't consider myself uber fit, i do enjoy exercising through different types of workouts from bikram yoga to resistance training and hybrid boot camp type workouts. doing both martial arts and boot camps in the past i was expecting a challenging but not necessarily a killer workout. i was wrong! although boot camp type workouts are often challenging, i feel the classes are often watered down a bit to the level of the overall level of the group. however, at 1 on 1 boxing, if the instructors feel like you can do more, they push you to do more. if you the 10 pound medicine ball is too light, they'll give you the 12 or 15. if you are slacking on punches, they get on you to punch harder. i haven't had a workout yet that i walked away feeling unchallenged. what i do like is that the workouts vary from class to class. some days it's all leg work (which i hate, but usually means that's what i need to work on) to boxing drills to medicine ball work to old school skip rope, running and sit ups. a big plus for me is that there is no cursing - including the music that's played. i hate cursing and the disparaging comments that often come along with it. being vulgar doesn't make me feel more like a fighter. my only con is this. i would like them to offer another option for their classes. it seems it's just one deal with $99 for unlimited classes. if they had a punch card type system at a reasonable price i would go for it."
5-star,1,"when i wanted to get in ultimate shape for my wedding, i knew i need a fun, varied and one-of-a-kind workout program. i found chris at 1on1 boxing fitness through one of my friends. as a fitness enthusiast, i went in confident that i could keep up and not expecting much of a challenge. evidence to the contrary. i left my first session covered in sweat and out of breath. the workout was non-stop and totally crushed my preconceived notions! the next day, muscle i didn't even know i had were sore. after 8-weeks of boxing, my arms are tighter, stomach is flatter and my legs look fabulous. if you're looking for a challenging but extremely effective workout, i highly recommend 1on1 boxing fitness."
5-star,1,"chris and his staff are amazingly committed to every client's success. the gym is open, friendly, and the workouts are intense, but also customized for every level of fitness and ability. don't have to want to box professionally to benefit from this one-on-one approach....even my 8 yr old son is counting the days until he's able to start training with chris! love this gym!"
1-star,0,"signed up for a membership in 1990, lifetime family membership in california. i continued to pay my dues each and every month regardless if i went or not. i moved to az sept 2014 and notified them of the move, went to their gilbert facility. 24 hour fitness sold out to la fitness here in az and did not notify me. i try to go back to the gym after being on medical and found out that i cannot go so i called 24 hour fitness. was told by the representative that my membership should have been transferred, went into la fitness and was told that was not true. i was told that since my membership was bought in california that i was not eligible for the az transfer even though i had notified them that i live in arizona. this transfer was 5 months ago while i was on medical, they continued to take the payments out of my account, not notifying me of the sell to la fitness and now they will not let me go to la fitness. i called 24 hour fitness once again, was again told that they did not transfer my lifetime membership to arizona but i could still go in california. why would i want to do that - what part of living in arizona did they not understand? they will only return this month's dues and cancelled my membership. i sent an email to their corporate and one week later still have not heard from them. they are liars and cheats. do not go to these people - after being a member for 27 years, they will not work with you! they should be sued for fraud."
4-star,1,"this has been my gym for the past 2 years, it is a nice location with nice equipment and pleasant staff. there is always room to work out on whatever equipment you desire and the price is very reasonable as well."
4-star,1,"i have been to my fair share of 24 hour fitness locations around the country and this is on the upper side of them. what's great about this particular location is that the clientele isn't uppity and this isn't a social scene (ahem la fitness). people come here to work hard and get it done. it's a clean facility and very no nonsense. you won;t find tv screen on each cardio machine here but everything works well. the group classes are great just get there early enough to sign up and get a bright orange or pink slip to secure your place. i would recommend the body pump class on thursday evenings...the instructor is fantastic at keeping you moving and keeping the class fun while being so nice. the trainers here are really helpful and constantly offering small tips to help you with your workout such as: you will get better movement if you push your seat back a little or push your elbows in a little closer, etc. or a simple how's your workout going today?i appreciate it because sometimes i have no clue what i'm doing and i'm glad that the employees are friendly enough to stop by and help out. i did a personal training session with adrian and i must say, if you are looking for a great workout from a very motivational trainer, you should sign up to see adrian today. he definitely understands fitness and is constantly encouraging and helpful."
5-star,1,"i've been to many, many gyms and this is by far my favorite one ever. it's not the biggest gym, and it's not the best, but it has the best trainers, plenty of equipment and the nicest people you'll ever meet! it's never overly crowded, plenty of parking, they let me park my bike inside when i ride it up there and i get super fit with my awesome trainer. what's not to love? mary, i think she's the manager, has the best sense of humor and is incredibly nice and very informed. she can answer all your questions. she also acts like she loves seeing me - ha! my fabulous trainer that beats any i've ever had, ryan, knows his stuff. i've worked out with trainers who pushed me and hurt me, but ryan never has. he pushes me, but safely. he's probably the most knowledgeable trainer i've ever had. he's also goofy and fun to train with. you really can't be that! this gym is above-par and i don't want to ever move because i love it so much! i hope i can work out here forever!"
3-star,0,"it appears you can't review each gym individually which is unfortunate. i would give the val vista location a 4 and arizona location 2 but i can't so...here's a 3 to combine them. the val vista location is clean, bright and the people are friendly. they have a good assortment of classes. 10:30 group classes are geared towards seniors. if you're not a senior but new to exercising or injured, this might be a good alternative. it'll get you moving but it's not too rigorous and everyone is very friendly. i tried the yoga class and although i completely suck at it, i wasn't made to feel uncomfortable. she offered several options for different levels. i made eye contact one time and she motioned on how i could improve my posture without calling me out. much appreciated! the 9:30 zumba class was really good. again, friendly trainer and classmates. i was happy to be in a class where everyone seemed real and not like they were all dressed for an audition for the next flash dance."
1-star,0,"beware! i believe it was back in 2007 when my best friend and i decided to get gym memberships at this 24 hour fitness. she signed up for the month-to-month option where they debit your monthly fee from your account. i was not comfortable with this and after severe pressure from one of the ""trainers"" (a.k.a. used car salesmen), i decided to pay ahead, in full, for a 3 year membership. it was a 3 year membership, end of story - this was not a continuous membership in any way, shape, or form. my friend and i usually went to the yoga classes but we did use the machines and pool/sauna as well. i decided to bring my mom along once and let her use one of my guest passes. it was then when things turned south. one of the ""trainers"" decided to try to talk us into getting personal trainer sessions and measure our bmi, total body fat, etc. tests. after going the rounds several times as to why we weren't interested (spending about an hour of our time there), we left the gym, having not signed up for these services. since i was already a member of the gym, this bozo unfortunately had my phone number and began calling me, non-stop. he called about every hour or so for a few days (i am not over exaggerating). it got to the point where my husband had to intervene and ask him to quit calling me. the next time i went back to the gym, this ""trainer"" glared at me the entire time. he watched me move from machine to machine. it made me incredibly uncomfortable. i actually considered asking for special permission to move my membership to another 24 hour fitness, even though my particular plan was only for their gym. the location happened to be convenient for me so i thought it would be better to just call and speak to the manager instead, so i did. i called and told the manager what was happening and let him know that i was uncomfortable to use the membership for which i had paid dearly. the manager apologized and assured me it wouldn't happen again. well, he apparently did speak to the ""trainer,"" (as he should have) because the trainer was even more angry when i returned. he still watched me and glared, only this time, he stood up and made it very deliberately obvious that he was trying to physically intimidate me. i had had enough. i was less than a year into my three year membership but i couldn't stand going there any longer. i finally quit showing up. i really should have asked for my money back, but they had explicitly told me that it was non-refundable. i was a very busy person and didn't have the time or energy to argue the situation so i just decided to cut my losses and move on. over two years later, my mom called me, telling me she had received something in the mail for me from 24 hour fitness. odd, i thought, because i have never lived with my mom in arizona, so how did they get that address for my name? furthermore, i had moved to the east coast. my mom was visiting me anyway so she brought the envelope with her. i opened it up and it basically said that my membership was up and i needed to call them. confused, i called and explained that i had paid for a 3 year membership (and that was all). i said that i wasn't sure why they assumed that i should automatically be signed up again when i didn't opt for the continuing membership. i also mentioned that i hadn't been to their gym in almost 2 years. the lady on the phone was nice and gave me a confirmation number for my ""cancellation."" i told her that didn't make any sense because there was nothing to cancel, but whatever. about two weeks later, i began to get incessant phone calls from an unknown 800 number. i googled it to find people who were outraged - it was a collection agency for 24 hour fitness. seriously, wtf?? like i said, this was a 3 year, non-continuous membership. nevertheless, i still called them and received a cancellation number indicating that i would no longer be using their gym! add to all of this the harassment and physical intimidation that i had to endure by their trainer and i was livid! i contacted the gym and let them have it. i told them that they had sent me to collections for no reason and that their staff had harassed/intimidated me and i demanded that they remove me from collections, as there was nothing to collect! i explained that my husband and i always have attorneys on retainer (this is true) and if they did not act immediately, we'd be suing. that day, they removed me from collections. i did check my credit report a while later and thankfully, there were no adverse marks from this incident on it. a few weeks later, a former coworker of mine told me that he had just been wrongfully sent to collections by the same gym. seriously, stay away. i will never have another gym membership again. i refuse to be scammed. i would rather invest that money in my own workout equipment. thanks a lot for robbing me blind, 24 hour fitness!!!"
4-star,1,"i've been coming to this gym for what feels like foreverrrrrrr! lol. it has to be maybe 6 years now. =) it's not one of those glamorous gyms like lifetime fitness or la fitness but it has everything i need in a gym and i love it. plus it doesn't cost a fortune for a membership either. but then again i signed up for one 6 years ago. it has all of your basic necessities and everyone is super friendly. i actually hate going to the gym. lol. but force myself to do so because a 6 pack abs do not just magically appear out of nowhere and neither does a toned body. lol. this location is actually a little bit farther from my house but i like how the machines are set up and how friendly everyone is so it's worth the drive for me. my only negative to this gym is they keep increasing my monthly payment. they tack on a few cents once every few months. i think they make it a small amount so you don't notice it as much but i definitely see it! i started at $18 a month 6 years ago, and now i am at $21 a month. lol. so if you just need your basic daily gym without the works at a good reasonable price, then check it out folks. =)"
2-star,0,the manager is useless. machines are broken and never repaired for long periods of time. the only advantage to joining this club is for the hours!!
3-star,0,decent place. it's just so dark in there like a dungeon. i'm not sure if there trying to save money by not turning lights on but it's hard to get a good workout and have good energy in dim light. other than that it's pretty good.
4-star,1,i have been attending this gym now for over a year. it certainly is a no frills gym and it simply works. the staff are polite and friendly. the monthly rates are reasonable in comparison to other gyms. the child center is great. the only reason why they not get 5 stars is that they need some new flat screen tv that do not reflect!
3-star,0,"i am commenting on the class schedules and the service i received at this gym. coming from california, i felt like the gym i went to in sf had more flexible class times that worked with my schedule. since i work the typical 9-6 days monday-friday, it is hard to find time to attend the group x classes. i am a big fan of these exercise classes. i told myself before i would never do them but once i did, i got hooked! i haven't had the opportunity to cycle at this particular location because it is packed/booked on saturdays morning but i have done bodypump with corinne here. i like the bodypump class. it is your typical bodypump class with the similar layout. corinne is very energetic and positive. i am a little surprised that all the 24 hours gym in arizona do not have towel service. also, the machines are decent but they are a little old. the trendmills do their job but sometimes they scare me because they seem more squeaky than they should be. the fan on a few of them don't work. also, it seems really warm in this location in the cardio section for some reason. also, i noticed a weird odd smell when i first walk in the door. it's like a moldy, wet, chlorine smell... yuck! bleh."
4-star,1,"i like this gym. it's close by, it's open at ridiculous hours when one should be sleeping, but for some reason i want to be swimming or ""playing"" basketball (usually that consists of me missing the shot and running around the court chasing the ball, but at least it's 2:00am in the morning and no one else is around!!) and it's not fancy schmancy so i don't have to try too hard. ha. i've found it to be pretty clean, and i like the front desk staff. i've only tried one of the group zumba classes because my friend was into it, but it's not really my thing. but i hear that the classes are well-attended, so if you like the group exercise dynamic they're probably good."
1-star,0,"pros: clean / few darned good trainers. cons: dark inside, staff changes frequently and personalities are just ok. equipment is outdated and only the pads have ever been updated. my spouse and i had been members on and off for 8 years and mostly returned for the location factor. recent cancellation attempts were nearly impossible. each time my husband made the drive back there to cancel, he was told a manager must be present to cancel a membership - how terribly inconvenient and unnecessary. the third and final time, i went with him to cancel. we were told the manager is once again, not there, which the day before we were told she would be there. ""cammeron"" took our information, had my husband sign a piece of paper with his login information, but nothing to show cancellation. i requested said documentation but was told the information would have to be forwarded to the manager and that she would be in the next day 9-5. i called the the following day at 12:51pm and guess what?? no manager, again. however, a very competent sounding employee (shocker) named gabby was very helpful and said the account showed to be canceled and no further dues would be debited...we shall see. it should be noted that we tried four times by phone to the toll-free membership services department for 24-hour fitness, who outsources their call center -- very frustrating. this problem was much worse the last time we tried to cancel and our dues were taken out three more months than we were told and we had to badger the former manager for our refund. oddly enough, our address was current with the club location, but the corporate office sent a check to an old address, and they were supposed to credit our bank account. don't waste your time. try another gym. in fact, if you are close enough to go to planet fitness at arizona ave/loop 202 santan...go!!! no waiting for equipment, no grumpy aqua ladies that drag water all over the locker room like at 24 hour fitness, no annoying zumba class attendants clogging the walkways, no childcare...simple, clean and friendly."
2-star,0,"i joined 2 weeks ago. im not impressed with this gym for several reasons.. the first week there was no paper towels in the womens bathroom for 3 days. the pool is over chlorinated, and there is (still) a dark brown scum ring all around pool tile. some of the ""regular"" elderly ladies are rude. they make comments and glare when they get splashed, and ask you to move over beacause that is ""their spot"". the overall gym cleanliness and experinence is meh. on a good note, i will say the pool instuctors are very nice, and i feel i get a good work out. val, is awesome! i will stay here because is it's close, and i'm determined to get in shape!"
3-star,0,"maybe it's just because it was my first time there (don't live in the area), but this place gave off weird vibes to me. the atmosphere reminds me of a cave and some of the weight equipment looks like it's from the '80s. overall, i like the mesa riverview and the mckellips/power locations better but this is still do-able and should have everything you need."
4-star,1,"this place was my mainstay up until march of this year. i don't know what the heck happened, but it was like everyone started going there in january in the evening, and i felt crowded out. mind you, nobody individually crowded me out! everybody was always super friendly, and i was always able to find a treadmill there. (i think i am a bit socialphobic!!) the staff there is awesome, i will always miss them! they are the best front desk gym people i know, and were always helpful, and went above and beyond to help me feel comfortable there. value wise, if you are going to pick a gym, this is the best i could find, and it is very reasonable for everything they offer. i could come here 6 nights a week, and they never made me feel like i was spending too much time in the gym. (i need it!) which i have gotten in other gyms before. the locker rooms were always clean. i really appreciated that. the jacuzzi had a weird dark yellowish tinge that looked gross, and made the place look dirty in the pool area.i never used that, i don't do yellow water eeewwwww! staff were aware of it, and i am sure they would have done something about it if they could have. why the yellow water in the jacuzzi 24 hr fitness? i promise i will come back if you fix that problem! it's super gross! ok, but other than that- if that yellow jacuzzi were missing, i'd give it 5 star."
2-star,0,"well, i'll start with the good things. the staff seems pretty nice, and the class instructors are pretty nice. (one of the instructors is a little weird though - i think she teaches piyo and spin, but at least she's somewhat entertaining). i've belonged to a couple gyms, including a 24 hour fitness super sport in oregon (now that place was super nice). this place is...just... well... eh... actually most of the 24 hour fitness locations in the valley are just ok. they're small, crowdy, sometimes really humid and hot for some reason, and the classes are crowded and offered only at really limited times. some of the zumba classes you have to get to over 30 minutes early, and then get a number and wait in line just to get in. what a waste of my evening! also, you'll never find a class that starts later than 6:30pm, they just don't seem to have those, and seeing how i work 25 mins away and rarely get out before 6, it makes it very difficult to make any of their classes. especially since (as mentioned earlier) some of them you have to get to super early just to get in! so, needless to say, i'm stuck for another year because i did the 2 year prepaid membership from costco (at least it works out to only 12$ per month), but after my membership is up i'll be going elsewhere. it's worth a little more to me for a nicer place and better class offerings. in the meantime, i'll just continue complaining to everyone who listens, and do my best working out on my own using their fitness equipment."
4-star,1,what i like about 24 hour fitness is the monthly membership is very reasonable. if you go in the early morning it's easy to get on the machines. it not fancy and i feel like i can go 'as is' ~ no one notices you. it is not a pick-up place . . . it just a nice clean place for people to exercise . . . and as a 'mature' woman i don't feel intimated. the only thing i don't care for is that they have a very limited selection of classes and times . . . and the classes they do have are to packed. i am happy they are in business. blessings to them. : ) kc
4-star,1,"finally a good gym by my parent's house that i can raid on vacation. i was very wary at first when they told me i would have to pay 10 bucks a day for the week, but after a nice persistance i was abe to get a better deal. nice equipment, not too crowded in the middle of the day, a little bit of a dirty gritty feeling after manhandling the weights but not as bad as bally's; big open space with plenty of light, lots of machines. wish they had these in chicago!"
3-star,0,"they offer lots of great deals including a 24-day guest pass. it tends to get pretty busy, so you might want to go in there on off hours. otherwise, i like this place. they just need to get more machines so i dont have to go at 8 at night or 3 in the morning to get a machine."
2-star,0,"i am bringing down my rating to 2 stars. yes, i did get a good deal on my gym membership at 24 hr but the fitness classes are way too packed and overcrowded! i took dance class on saturday and it was packed with about 50-60 ladies. it was so difficult to hear the instructor and she did not give very much instruction's on how to do the dance moves correctly. i was so disappointed. i will not be renewing my membership after it expires. until my membership expires i will stick to the treadmills, circuit training. i will continue to take my fitness classes (yoga, dance/zumba kickboxing) elsewhere, even though it's a little extra money."
1-star,0,"stay away. i joined the gym in 2013. it was convenient. i didn't use much in the way of different equipment, but it served it's purpose. cleaning is a real problem. they had black stuff growing in the showers. i reported it. the manager stated he had reported it to corporate and there was nothing else he could do. it still took a few weeks to get something done after i sent pictures to corporate. machines are not maintained. there are machines that literally have not worked properly for over 3 years. they stated they could not get parts anymore. i was in contact with corporate repeatedly. they finally stated they would reset my dues to what i started at. it seemed like there was some improvement in the cleaning. i checked my credit card statement one month and the dues were rolled back. several months later, i checked my statement again and the dues had been raised after that one month. they lied about rolling back the dues. the manager apologized that the corporate representative wasn't clearer about the rollback of the dues but there was nothing that could be done. obviously, they lied and hoped i would not check my statements. i liked the gym because it was convenient for me, but will not continue to patronize a business after they lie and cheat me on the dues."
2-star,0,"disclaimer: i've been a member since 2013 and this review is for a visit i recently took to this gym after being away using my apartment gym for a while. i also called and took a guest with me for their free 3 day pass. this review focuses on 3day passes for your guests, and my guests initial reaction. location: i only come to this location because a long time ago the henderson one closed down. it's a bit out of the way for someone who lived over by wagonwheel. now i live over by russell and it's about 12 minutes away. it's in an easy to access spot in a nice area. parking: ample amounts and fairly safe, so no need to worry! entrance: same as the other gyms, you go in an sign in at the front counter. luckily, there were 3 people in front to help us with my guests 3day pass, 1 in which i believe i spoke with on the phone to make sure there there was a 3 day pass for new people trying the place out. pros: -they have all you need with multiple of each. -the layout is different with a lower level and raised 2nd level. (no, they're not directly under/over each other) which is cool! classes/personal training/etc. cons: - not sure if it was just today, but it seems to be...cleanish, until you're on them, and then you see they're filthy. (ellipticals were so dirty on the bottom with grime that i could see, squeaked loudly, and were hard to use. could make someone self conscious with all that noise) -treadmills made the loudest noise when trying to use that i could hear myself and wanted to stop running. luckily the other one i went on was okay afterwards. please check these more often. -was hard finding certain machines because i wasn't sure what was up above or below, etc. (she gave my guest a horrible tour) (but i'm sure i'd be fine after going there a couple more times) -price for new members is much higher here than at other local joints. (but they do have discounts! depending on company of being added on, etc) ****overbearing sales people. (as soon as we got in and signed him up to try the gym for 3 days, we were directed to a sales lady whose name i will keep anonymous. she gave us a tour that did not let my guest see much, barely gave info about the gym, and then introduced us to her boss and sat us down. not a good tactic. please let people actually use the gym before trying to sell a membership. also, please get more informed about other gyms in the area and tell me why this one is any better. i was a sales person for 4 years...i get it, but if you're going to do it-which is already horrible at a gym that could easily sell itself if it's that great- know your stuff and do better than ""it's cheaper with this discount we've got because you're blah blah blah"" overall... my guest will not be getting a membership and i am thinking about cancelling mine. or we will just go to the farther locations. although there were many, the other gym he goes to is much cleaner and the people leave you alone. you didn't give him time to even see or use the gym. you also, as a sales tactic, said we had a 1 day use pass, which i argued was incorrect. i am not okay with dishonesty & needing overbearing sales people to get people to stay or create memberships. if i stay, i hope they will clean up the place and work on their sales people. luckily i can just walk by them after entering, but i won't be referring them or bringing guests."
1-star,0,"be very careful in dealing with this health club chain, 24 hour fitness. i formerly was a member but when they increased the monthly cost at the same time they closed down the location near me i decided to cancel my membership. but then over the phone some very-rehearsed clerk sweet-talked me into ""freezing"" it instead, which meant that although my monthly charge ended, suddenly months later their substantial yearly fee appeared on my credit card statement. when i called to ask it be removed since i had stopped coming months earlier, yet another smooth-talking customer-service person got belligerent and told me ""tough sh*t too bad, read the fine print"". unbelievable. as far as i am concerned they stole this money under false pretenses. it is devious practices like this that really chap my a$$ about underhanded american businesses. 24 hour fitness got plenty of money from me during the two-year tenure of my membership but still they dishonestly felt they could get away with grabbing my wallet one last time."
4-star,1,"old school gym with huge machine floor and free weight area. yeah, the cardio machines are ancient but it gives it charm. couple that with the 80s pastel colors and ekg markings on the wall and you're set! oh, and i love that the ladies' room has a hundred toilets! no more waiting!!!"
5-star,1,i love this gym. never packed like the other 24s even during peak hours. i usually have the whole place to myself late at night and it's so awesome! three big rooms of machines and weight equipment. definitely my favorite 24 in henderson/vegas area!
1-star,0,24 hour fitness has the worst customer service. i am a single mom that just lost her job and i had called them to cancel my membership that i had only had for 2 months and gave me a 800 number to call. i called the nimber and she said that she could pause my membership for 3 months and that i wouldnt be charged anything a month later i get charged a annual fee. i called them back and they said that they could not refund me my money that it was a non refundable annual fee. they did not try whats so everto fix it. they will tell you anything to get your money.
5-star,1,"i signed up for a membership last week. d helped me get all signed up, he's the best! i didn't know what i was doing except that i had intended to get a gym membership and he explained everything to me of what they offer, the classes that are included, the different locations, he covered every question and wonder i had. he was so awesome and welcoming, for that i thank him for his kindness and great customer service. give that man a raise! lol since then, i've been enjoying the u-jam classes and my daily work outs. even better that this is down the street from my house too! :)"
5-star,1,this gym is amazing. i can't believe it's averaging 3 and a half stars on yelp. especially for an active gym. it's big. it has twice as much stuff than other 24 hour gyms. if others have one of something they have two. if others have two they have four. the gym lay out is different but nice. they had things i never saw at other 24 hour fitness. like a treadmill rock climbing wall. the gym is old but very well kept. i like the old equipment better than what they put in the newer gyms. they even still have steal plates. i haven't seen a gym with steal plates in a very long time. they had a lot of ten pounders with rubber. guess the tens were getting stolen. this is a great gym that's not too far from the strip and is better than the one near fremont street. over all this is a great gym. they could give it a paint job and new tile too make it look new and updated.
1-star,0,"i came to this gym as a one-time guest since i live in los angeles. although i told the manager several times i don't live in nevada (even showed my california id) to sign in, he still stayed on my ass about signing up. even if i did leave in nevada, i wouldn't for the life of me, join this gym. it felt very untaken care of and neglected because all the equipment was dated, rusting and unlubed causing unsmooth pushing and pulling of tension with the machines. the treadmill could barely hold my weight, i was 260 lbs at the time. the ellipticals felt like they were going to fall off the tracks. for weeks after that one visit on that one weekend i was visiting vegas for a wedding, i was getting calls constantly asking me to talk about signing up. not only was my phone number from orlando florida and my address from los angeles, they didn't want to give up. eventually, they stopped bothering me..."
1-star,0,this location needs to be temporarily or permanently closed down. i went to this location because of yelpers good reviews and boy it was disappointing and disgusting. next to the bench press area i notice a hugh globe of mold up in the ceilings it was yellow and kinda brown so i immediately took off. it's sad to see 24 hour fitness demising throughout the years no matter it's in ca or nv.
1-star,0,"i'm updating my review due to the fact that for the last few months i been attending, i've noticed this gym is falling apart. all the equipments are very old and not functioning correctly along with the facade of the interior as well. the gym employees here, not all but i would say half have no customer service skills. the music itself is boring, always playing old classic rock and hick music. thank god for headphones and mp3 players or else there is just simply no motivation from the depressing music that is always playing. mentioned it to the staff before, but unfortunately they don't seem to care. i've been a member for 20 years now, and this is one of the worst 24 i've been to. it needs a total face lift and more qualified staff."
2-star,0,"i'm a longtime member of 24 hour fitness, so i thought i'd give this location a try since i had some errands to run close by. at a glance, this gym would have been almost perfect except for 3 things: the first thing i noticed when going into the men's locker room was one urinal was out of order (no biggie). i used the urinal next to it, and it damn near overflowed and almost got piss all over my shoes after flushing it. second issue was that some of the equipment i wanted to use were missing quick links and the pins for the cable machines. i had just finished using free weights, so i was still pumped up and ready to finish my routine with the cable machines. however, my adrenaline began to fade quickly because most of the cable machines in that area were missing the damn quick links and pins. i think i spent almost 5 minutes searching that area for the links to attach the bars/d-handles. the final issue i had were the treadmills. 3 treadmills i attempted to use stop working after about 20 seconds. their treadmills looked and operated like hand-me-down treadmills from one of those casino/hotel liquidations. i was very disappointed that i didn't get to my cardio. even one of the staff members told me they get complaints about the treadmills after bringing it to their attention. although the staff members were friendly, i doubt i will return to this location if the issues at hand aren't corrected."
4-star,1,"this was my gym home when i moved to vegas in 2005 and lived in the southwest. this visit was my first time back in at least eight years! it really hasn't changed at all. the decor actually reminded me of the 24 i signed up at back in the 90s. this is an active gym so no frills of the sports or super sports. just classes, cardio equipment and weights. they do have a rock climbing wall(machine) which used to be a staple in most 24s but not so much anymore. the cardio equipment is also older so don't expect a personal tv to be attached. on the plus side because it hasn't been renovated yet the weight area is more old school, spacious and user friendly. overall, the gym is clean, staff is friendly and i didn't notice any out of order signs"
4-star,1,gym is big and always empty. no swimming pool. but because it's empty you can almost always use multiple machines at the same time
2-star,0,"the good: gym is clean nice range of classes never busy nice range of machines and a lot of them not a lot steroid freaks the bad: equipment is very old a lot of equipment is broken, i've told the staff many times over the last few months, it never gets fixed tv's only work with an fm tuner radio, no way to plug headphones in, can't find an app that works with a phone to hear them a lot of the displays on the treadmills no longer work, can't see how fast you are going or level of incline"
5-star,1,"this location gets 5 stars for all their 'retro' equipment! equipment i haven't seen in a years! its a nice gym, not very crowded if you like to workout in the afternoon. found lots of different machines to have fun on. there are 3 different workout rooms with a variety of machines, cardio and yes the rock climbing wall(i will attempt that one of these days). great workout and i will be back for sure!"
5-star,1,so much betterthan lvac much cleaner and more people who would rather just work out. not a meat market. staff and trainers are great. this is the main one i go to but the decature one is just as good.
1-star,0,"they nearly doubled the price while i had been seeing the same broken equipment go un-repaired for weeks. unbelievable. did not review my membership for this year, would rather deal with the headache of changing gyms."
4-star,1,"been going for the last year and a half or so and this is my favorite 24 hour fitness in vegas, mainly because even during rush hours, it's nowhere near as busy as the 24 hour fitness on trop/decatur or the gold's gym on stephanie/215 or even the unlv gym. but i'm just antisocial when i work out so the less people, the better lol. that's mainly why i go late night when there's max 3 people. i think i've only had to wait on a machine one time. they offer lots of classes and i like that the weights are all together in one section and the cardio machines on the other side. also for some reason, i've noticed less space wasters here, you know, those people that sit on a machine and text for 15 minutes lol so that's always good . minus one star just because the machines are a little dated and it's a smaller location but overall still gets the job done :)"
5-star,1,love this 24. open space. not a lot of people. not a lot of creeping looking ass people. i always get a good workout here.
5-star,1,"i just recently got back to the gym last week after falling off the wagon :-(. however, i decided to bite the bullet and start with a trainer to get back on track and as luck would have it nancy just started with the gym! wow, she is great, i feel motivated, relaxed and she is a real people person! she listens to me, helps me with suggestions on where i want to get and the hour goes so quickly i can't believe it. thank you 24-hour fitness for bringing in a wonderful new talent just when i decided to come back and need it! :-)"
2-star,0,"due to my rating, i feel i must start off on a positive note. the employees here are stellar! they are very friendly and appreciate the fact that you have chosen their gym to work out in. i have belonged to two other gyms before and their customer service and friendliness does not compare by a long shot. so i must say, this location has the best employees ever! now for the ugly. this gym is completely worn down. the equipment is very old and outdated and a lot of it is either out of service or not working up to par. one morning, i jumped to three different stationary bikes until i found one that operated properly. and a lot of their stationary bikes do not have water bottle holsters, which means i have to power through 15-20 minutes of cardio with my water on the floor next to the machine and not readily available to me when i need a quick refreshment through my burn. i was a member of this gym two years ago, and was with them for four years (five years total counting when i worked out at the one near summerlin on w. sahara) and thought it was ok. but, in comparison to the one i worked out at off of w. sahara and being a member of lvac for the past two years, this location has the absolute worse gym equipment i have come across. sad day. i have to admit that i am going to test out club sport here sometime soon, solely based upon the fact that this location's equipment is just lackluster, outdated and poorly maintained. i hope the manager here and the 24 hour fitness brand reads these reviews and does something about this. as mentioned, love the employees and the people that work out here are super nice as well, but as a gym, it just doesn't cut it. at least not for me."
5-star,1,"i go early in the morning (when i'm in town). staff knows you by name, equipment is clean, patrons are friendly. weight room is in great shape, easy to get on and off equipment."
4-star,1,"it's a pretty standard 24-hour fitness. the equipment is in good shape, the staff is friendly, and they have a decent selection of classes. plus one for never being too busy, minus one for no pool or rowing machine. plus another one for being close enough to work for me to get in a pump over my lunch hour!"
5-star,1,"i visited this location while i was in town for the mr olympia expo. i have to say overall i was greatly impressed. the place looked small from the outside but it was pretty large on the inside. they have tons of fitness equipment inside.some machines i have never even seen before, and the iceing on the cake was the fact that they have metal weights. i go to 24hr fitness in my home town of murrieta ca and i wish our gym was like this one. i went at about 1am to workout so of course nobody was at the gym so i can't really say much about it being crowded. i was staying with my sister who lives off of flamingo in las vegas and i wanted to go work out at golds gym on flamingo but it is now closed. so for now on this 24hr fitness will be my new place to train in vegas. loved this gym!!!! the restrooms were nice and clean and i can't say enough about the machines that they have. they have everything!!!!"
5-star,1,"i love this gym! the weight room is awesome, never full, easy to get around and get my workout done, friendly staff (except angel, just kidding he's awesome), and i have taken one class that busted my ass. i hope they have it again. it was the nfl combine class with jason beauchamp. i haven't felt my doms hit since luke was my trainer at this gym a couple of years ago. this place is a place i can come to to get away from the everyday ho-hum adventures of life. if i could make a request it would be to add an additional squat rack up in the legs area. but i guess you'd have to find a place to put it. i was told about this website by tobias who works at the gym. i think that is his name. the cool guy with the great hair. i want to also say that i am not the same thomas f. that posted earlier."
4-star,1,"this is a very nice gym indeed; never too crowded, friendly staff, and more than enough equipment at any time of the day. the only thing i will nip-pick on is that the facility is quite old. other than that i love this place. why do i love it? here's why: i go here on the weekends during their busiest hours (4pm-8pm) and the place is barely full. yes, it is more crowded than usual but it's nothing compared to the one on flamingo, or any other gyms (like lvacs) as a matter of fact. in my opinion, there is nothing worse than to wait around with three other guys just to use one machine. also, their contract rocks. it's a no-strings-attached monthly deal. i guess the only time you feel gimped is in the beginning, because you need to pay a opening fee but that's merciful compared to the other greedy gyms. you can quit whenever you want because it's a monthly contract. i understand this facility is old but come on, it's not like the paint on the walls are peeling off. the equipments are a little aged but they work very well. i haven't had any issues with any of them malfunctioning. the water fountains have ice cold water and don't have any funny taste to them. the staff does a wonderful job of keeping the place tidy and they never fail to greet you by your name for a change. at lvac i'll be surprised if they even say hello (by now you should know i hate lvac). the staff will occasionally joke around with me and ask me how i'm doing. very nice people. true to their name, the gym is 24-hours. if you happen to have the urge to pump iron at 3am in the morning, you know you can count on this place. lvac says they have all 24-hour facilities, but their flamingo location actually closes early on the weekends, which was really upsetting. maybe one day when i'm in a bad mood i'll review lvac and dish out my first 1-star review. enough digression; this 24-hour rocks and the only reason why i give them 4-stars is because they are in need of a renovation. however, it makes up for it in great service and a wide array of available equipments."
3-star,0,"this is the ugly step-child of the 24 hour fitness family. they are obviously ignored by corporate. everything in the facility is old. thankfully, the staff does very well with the limited resources. first the negatives: locker room is small and locker size is even smaller. all the cardio equipment needs to be updated. treadmill belts need to be tightened and decks need to be waxed. i had to try four tm's before i could find one that didn't slip. positives: although the strength training equipment is old, the staff does a very good job of maintaining it. the layout is functional and machines are arranged appropriately. good group fitness instructors. this is one of the cleaner facilities in the 24 hour fitness family. never really busy. the clientele is made up of people looking for a good workout, not a bunch of douche bags trying to show off or get a date. the staff should be congratulated for the outstanding job they do. good job guys!"
4-star,1,people here are very helpful. usually not too busy to get right on a machine. classes here i hear are great but have yet to try one. i go there to just workout and leave. for this its great for me. no pool here is my issue but there are other 24 hours that have this.... but this is close to my house.
4-star,1,"very friendly staff, everything you could want to use to work out. no indoor track or pools, but that's available at the other nearby location for no additional charge. being a student i love that 24 is everywhere. this means i can go when i visit my parents back home."
1-star,0,"the facility itself is nice. relatively clean and solid equipment. my serious qualm w this place is the general manager martin. i usually don't blast people on yelp, but this guy is truly an idiot who is in dire need of professional training. every time i've had a question of concern, the nice little girl at the front desk refers me to this joke and he usually speaks w a disparaging tone and never really has any solutions. he simples blabs about ""our gym policy"" and speaks from a place of frustration. 24 hour fitness needs to step up and fire this guy or properly train him."
5-star,1,i love coming to this gym. never crowded. nice pool that offers lessons for kids. sheldon and riley are always very polite and helpful. will definitely recommend this gym.
1-star,0,"one star but i wish i could give zero. i agree with the other reviews about the gym being dirty, the staff being unprofessional, and the lack of customer service. read every word of each paper that you sign or email you receive regarding your membership because even if they are the ones that mess up, you are the one that pays (literally) and they do not give refunds. do not waste your money on them. bottom line they don't care about their customers. they only care about taking your money."
5-star,1,"i use 24 hour fitness all over the nation, great value and great gym. a gym that has a sauna, steam room, classes all day, as well as a good amount of weights and area to train. this is my favorite gym to use nationally now."
5-star,1,i love this place !!! it really helps me to get to the next level on my personal fitness!!! the staff is amazing like gloria!!!! sometimes machines are not always working or a toilet is out of service but i understand it's hard to keep a big place going!! for that and many other reasons i feel that you deserve five stars!!!
1-star,0,"24 hour.fitness crossed my account information with another member. intern, suspended my account because the other member cancelled their membership. i first noticed they had not taken out my dues from my bank account. i brought this to their attention immediately, they verified my credit card on file and said everything is fine. i noticed again they had not taken out my dues, and brought it to their attention once again. they verified my credit card and told me everything was good to go. after being stopped at the front counter check-in and embarrassingly told my account is suspended due to non-payment kama i called their corporate office. once again they laid blame on me, and said my account had been suspended due to non-payment. i have been a member since 2008 and have had the same credit card on file for many of those years. this is the first time that i've ever had a problem and it was due to their mistake. remember, they crossed account information with another member. which resulted in a non-payment for my membership because they were trying to take my monthly dues out of another member's bank account. in two days world you would think banking information credit card information and personal information would a huge concern and a organization is largest 24 hour fitness would take every security measure possible to ensure something like this would never happen?? i was told by the people at the front desk, that they would have the general manager mitch, call me as soon as he got in at 10 a.m. . at 11:30 i finally wound up calling the gym myself because i had not heard from anyone. i was informed that mitch was not there yet... and ask to speak to another manager. i spoke to another person by the name of thomas. thomas was very rude and short with me on the telephone. as i try to explain the whole story to him he kept interrupting me with, ""uh huh"" ""ya i know"" i finally had to ask him if he understood what i was telling him about the mistreatment and embarrassment that was caused at the front counter and how it was clearly their mistake entirely. he acted very unconcerned, and as if i were wasting his time and interrupting his day. i finally had to steer the conversation to an end because i felt myself quickly becoming more upset. his last statement to me was, "" ya i know you feel like we don't care about you, i apologize about that, i'll have mitch call you"". here it is the following day and still no phone call. for a gym that has constant broken equipment, and that equipment stays broken for weeks on end before it's fixed or replaced period for a gym that is a lot healthier then most of their gyms. and is usually in a disorderly mess as far as equipment and weights out of place all over the gym, missing weights and equipment, i have to question now why would anybody pay monthly dues to a place that really does not care about their members, and doesn't give their members what they're paying for, and only to be treated like you were a piece of trash.?"
1-star,0,"beware! i signed a contract, worked out for a bit, everything was fine. but, got married and now i have zero time for a gym so i had to cancel. you cannot cancel online, you must call number and talk to them. i told them i have to cancel and they said no problem. just pay early termination fee of over $200. i almost flipped out and asked why. i was told that my contract was actually financing the money for the membership and i had to repay that. unbelievable, this is a gym membership not a car or a house! i am trying to work with my bank but not looking well. terrible way to do business, terrible company. very rude phone support. never again."
1-star,0,"this business just took 50 dollars out of my account for an ""annual fee"". this was never explained to me and the manager even acknowledged this to me. my problem is this suprise fee came 5 or 6 months after i signed up. i feel this fee should have been waived for this year. when my contract with this gym is up i'm going to join planet fitness half the price and no contracts. do yourself a favor find a gym where the fees aren't hidden"
1-star,0,"for having an onsite maintenance person there 5 days a week it seems a little strange to see so many ""temporarily out of order signs"" everywhere. 2 of the toilets in the woman's restroom are going on a month now. equipment is going on over 13 months now. if you have no intentions of fixing things why not remove it. don't expect to work out to music that's broken too going on 8 days now. also expect to be treated like a child and have to check certain items out using your drivers license. the club manager is a joke the district manager doesn't return phone calls. join another club."
5-star,1,"i've been a serious gym goer for almost a decade now and i know what i like and what is important to me when it comes to fitness centers. i've been a member of plenty of different gyms across 2 different states. golds, 24, la fitness, eos, ballys.. the list goes on. this far and away is my favorite gym. the first and most important thing that i look at when choosing a gym is how busy it gets during peak hours. the second is the quality and variety of machines and weights. the third is the behavior of its staff and members. 24 hour fitness on craig is exactly what i want in a gym. i won't comment on the group classes, the trainers, the pools or other amenities because frankly, i don't use them and don't plan on it in the future. this gym is hardly ever busy (which means equipment is hardly ever broken), most of the clientele that frequent this place are friendly and generally keep to themselves and and the weight and bench set up is ideal. i know that a busy gym is a profitable gym. i'd gladly pay double or even triple my membership fee ($29 a month) to keep the casual gym folk out. lvac and eos is where these chatter boxes belong. i don't want to wait 30 minutes to get in the squat rack because a female in brand new yoga pants is attempting to take the perfect picture of her ass and i don't want to wait for 30 minutes for a bench press because a group of teenage guys can't stop gawking at her. i'm a lifter. i don't come here to socialize. this gym is perfect."
4-star,1,i enjoy this gym and it is close to my house. equipment is a little outdated but that is fine with me. i enjoy their classes.
4-star,1,"i've been a member for the past 5 years. pros: what i care about most is the cardio group exercise classes, and the instructors are excellent. hallelujah, they finally installed fans, so the level of exhaled co2 in there is tolerable. if you catch a promotion, the price can be reasonable. the staff and fellow gym-goers are overall friendly and make it a good experience. cons: as other reviewers mentioned, the decor is outdated, some of the machines need repair--oh, and watch out for the pool/hot tub. more often than not, it's some funky green color and smells like moldy dishrags. (another reviewer here posted a pic of the pool... it's not the lighting, it's really that shade of green, yes.) bottom line: depending on what you want from a gym, it might work for you. do the trial membership before signing a contract."
1-star,0,beware!!! if you sign a contract a 2yr contract. it does not end when you're contract is up. you have to call them to cancel or they will continue to charge you every month. it's not right for them to do renew the contract without your authorization. beware!!!!
4-star,1,"a very nice gym indeed. i was in town on business for the day and was early for my appointment so i decided to put in an impromptu workout at this gym. i found this to be a clean gym with fairly new equipment and maintained in good working order. i did not see any ""out of order"" sign on any equipment which is unusual because it seems something is always broken at home gym in san berghetto."
5-star,1,i walk in to the gym and the manager christina greets me with a huge smile and a welcome to 24. i loved her enthusiasm and her customer service was excellent. i'm from out of town and she made me feel like i was at my home gym. everyone was very curious as well.
5-star,1,"this is my go-to location. friendly staff (even more-so if you're a regular and they recognize you), clean facility and never crowded. i never have an issue getting right to the machine i want to use. maintenance must be a priority as i rarely see ""out of service"" signs on any of the equipment"
1-star,0,"i give this one star because you have to give it something. where do i begin... first, the cleanliness, or lack thereof. not once do you see staff members walking around and wiping down/disinfecting the vacant machines. i was a member at another gym, and any machine that was not in use was frequently being sprayed and wiped clean with something like simple green. this location will have multiple people at the front desk, but in my opinion, it really doesn't take 5 people to watch you scan your finger for entry. instead, some of those employees should be walking around disinfecting. i have seen multiple machines covered in sweat, paper towels on the floor, empty bottles left laying around, dust, and other wet stuff on the floors/machines that you wouldn't want to see or wonder what it is during your workouts. and should we talk about the bathrooms??????? that's another story in itself....what the bathrooms need is bleach. no scratch that...a wrecking ball and overhaul. i don't understand how anyone would take a shower in those stalls and come out clean...the bathrooms and locker room area are beyond filthy. i think the staff should walk around and spray down and wipe down machines that aren't in use with a strong disinfect hourly. it's a gym, and gyms can get gross and sweaty and this location can use all the help in the cleaning department it could get. there is a cleaning lady walking around and i've seen her mopping before with jet black water that smells like a dirty sponge, but how effective can that be????? and if the water is that black, that should send a clear message to management that it needs to be done more often. secondly, i left my other gym and came here because i wanted the option to attend classes. i should have stayed where i was at. there's really not a lot of variety with the classes. i mean how many zumba classes does one gym need???? if you are only interested in zumba or body pump, then that's about as diverse as it gets. there are other classes, but they are not offered as much. the class calendar here also looks nothing like golds gym. if you want more choices in classes at varying times, then this is not the gym for you. with las vegas being a 24 hour city and this being a 24 hour gym, i just expect more in that department.....especially if you're paying almost $30.00 a month. other that that, the equipment is fine...dirty, but it's effective and gets the job done. it's a decent size...not too big, not too small. i don't use the pool, steam room, or sauna so i can't comment on that. because of how dirty it is, that deters me from trying. i usually want to get in and get out. i also try to avoid the restrooms...do that before you come here. plus you have to walk through the locker area to get to those areas, and we don't want to traverse down that road again, right??? but i would expect the steam room/sauna/pool area to look like the rest of the gym...filthy. all the other reviews that discuss the lack or sanitation and cleanliness at this gym are right on point. don't ignore them if you feel more comfortable working out in a clean sanitized environment."
5-star,1,"every time my boyfriend and i visit north las vegas, i come to this 24. it is always clean, smells good, and never packed. you don't get weird guys checking you out, even if you're the only girl in there. it's big with the equipment well placed and easily accessible. i love the chill atmosphere in here. i wish they had a 24 like this in san diego."
2-star,0,"not impressed with this location. the inside was dark, dingy, and in desperate need of an update. the locker room floor was wet (more than what's typical and not near the showers) and many of the lockers with built-in locks didn't work. the equipment was ok, though it took me a few tries to find a treadmill that didn't have broken parts. the cardio area (floor mats, stretching, exercise balls) was small and difficult not to run into people. also, our membership was expiring soon and upon checking in, got a sales pitch about signing up again and had to talk to staff to get our check in approved. there were male staff cleaning the women's locker room so i had to hurry to get my stuff and change before the cleaning. is it not possible to find female staff for the ladies locker room? i've been to some lovely 24 hour fitness locations, but this one could use some help. though the reason for not renewing my membership is primarily because the town we currently live in does not have a 24 hour fitness location, i think i'll stick with gold's in the future."
1-star,0,"ladies do not go late night!! the man who cleans at night can't seem to stay out of the women's locker room. in the past three weeks, i have found him in there twice before the posted time the sign says a man will be cleaning (1am - i saw him at 12:30am one time and 12:20am another) and five times after the posted time (which used to be 2:00am and is now 3am). i even left a note at the front desk for club management when he was in there at 3:40am (before the time was changed from 2am) which made no difference. tonight he was again in there after 3am and was upset at me for complaining about it to the front desk person. it's the same man each time who keeps being there. how ridiculous!! by the way, i've seen him actually clashing in there once - all the other six times he was staring at himself in the mirror. very creepy!!!"
3-star,0,"it's a gym that gets the job done. cleanliness - varies. generally, it's clean, but during peak hours i've noticed trash and forgotten personal items lying around on the ground near some of the machines. as for the women's restroom/locker room, it's never been filthy whenever i've gone there. machines - they're older than the ones i work out on at my main gym, but they're still functioning well. the one major concern i have is with the proximity of the weight machines. some machines are too close to one another. i actually bumped my head on one while bending down to pick up something. classes - the group x classes here are great and they're the primary reason why i come to this gym on occasion. however, there are two reasons i sometimes avoid coming here for classes. 1. the workout room is smaller than other 24 hour fitness locations i've been to. try going here at peak hours for a zumba class that has 50+ people packed in that space. there's hardly any room to move, and the place becomes unbearably stuffy. 2. i've always noticed men standing below the classroom to watch the women workout. talk about unsettling. staff - perhaps one of the friendliest and most helpful i've encountered thus far out of the 24 hour fitness gyms i've visited. other - if you come here during the evening, note that the parking lot isn't well-lit. i suggest parking as close as possible to the gym considering that its location isn't exactly in a safe part of town. overall - this place isn't perfect, but like i said, it does get the job done if you need to workout and head out."
5-star,1,"this 24 hour fitness has everything i need in a gym. i've seen bigger and newer 24 hfs, but this one has a great energy to it. they have tons of machines, so there's rarely a wait to get on anything you need. i often use the pool/steam room/sauna facilities, and i have had no problems there. some have said here that the locker rooms are not clean, but i think they are fine. i see cleaners circulating around the facilities nearly every time i am working out. i don't love going to classes in general, but the ones that i have gone to here are really fun. i've done the zumba and body pump. every teacher i had was friendly and energetic, and really made an effort to learn people's names. my best experience here was with personal training. i tried several trainers out, but ultimately found a good fit for me with brenda. she is very knowledgeable and created some really good workouts for me. before i had her, i had a trainer that left suddenly. management practically bent over backwards to make sure i was happy with my new trainer. they are also always having promotions for personal training prices so if you are interested in this, keep your eyes open around the gym for fliers with details."
1-star,0,"this is the closest club to my house that has a steam room, sauna, whirlpool and an indoor swimming pool - all unisex. perfect ! i thought. the front desk was uninterested when i gave my guest pass, next the locker area was spartan but adequate, bring your own towels, the shower was in need of bleach as was the steam room. the steam room was filled with wet paper towels, empty plastic bottles and a funky smell. the sauna was under repair, however it was working the next day, but it was being used by members as a lounge retreat and they made it obvious no one was welcome to interrupt their environment by continuing to lay all over the benches. the whirlpool was at 102 degrees - far too cool to get any benefit. i did not use the pool, however it looked fine, except for the member complaining how dirty it was the day before. the gym equipment was being wiped down by no one - members nor staff. there was no individual tv access at any of the equipment - just rafter mounted tvs where you needed a radio to tune in to the small tvs. the floor in the class area was being replaced due to roof leakage and all classes were cancelled for the week - since they have no secondary space. i found the $ 33.00 per month charge out of line for the qualiy of this gym. if this place were clean and updated and they enforced a few courtesy rules on it's members it would be perfect - until then it's just a mess!"
4-star,1,"this gym tends to get below average reviews due to its size, cleanliness, and volume of equipment. having said that, this may be most people's worst gym. however, this gym is actually my favorite. i'm here about 4 days a week, sometimes twice a day. this gym is full of regulars. like cheers, where everyone knows your name. i don't have a problem with the staff. in fact, they are like an extended family for me. i'm always greeted by name when i enter and leave. and no, they are not cheating by reading the computer screen. usually greeted before i sign in. feels like home here. when i walk in, usually get the hellos and nods from the other regulars. what i like most about this gym is that people are here to workout. get in, get out. i do avoid this gym on monday and tuesday nights due to how crowded it can get. and, it's only crowded, because it's small. the rest rooms are filthy, but i don't use them anyway. overall, gave this gym 4 stars because i'm able to get the type of workout i search for. people here tend to respect your workout and save their chatter with you once you're done."
1-star,0,"i currently go to lvac but my dad goes to 24 hour fitness. when he came to town he wanted to take me to one. so we went to this one and were sad we did. first strike: they refused to let me as a guest try the gym without paying. seriously ten dollars. weird because i thought every gym had a 7 day pass to try the gym. nope. second strike: he told my dad he needed to sign the parent/guardian portion of my guest paper. i was like i'm 28 and the reception guy said oh you look really young. seriously i don't look like i'm 16. he was also very rude about it. i wanted to say ""dude not only do i get paid a whole lot more than you but i have my flippin masters so suck it"". third strike: i was trying to figure out out to watch the tv since there wasn't a plug in on my machine. tried to find another employee to ask but no one was around. of 3 of there tvs were out anyway. oh and no fans!!!!! my advice go to lvac this place was so unfriendly."
2-star,0,"i recently cancelled my 24 hr gym membership after 5 years and 3 cities. this was the gym closest to my house that i actually tried to avoid and would drive to the one on ann rd an extra 5 miles just because this one was so bad. this 24 hr is really outdated with old equipment, only 4 channels on itty bitty tv's to watch and it is fairly dirty. the big thing they needed to figure out was more gym cleaning stuff and not let it run out all the time. how hard is it to refill a paper towel dispenser. i have been in probably 15 different 24 hr fitnesses on the west coast and this is probably in the bottom 3."
3-star,0,"first time i've been to this gym. this is actually really close to where i'm staying during my trip out to vegas. convenience. i like that. my buddy and i parked and headed toward the front entrance. sliding doors open to reveal a good sized gym. let the buffness begin! environment: the gym is decent sized. it probably looked bigger because there weren't too many people working out (around 30 total). the equipment is spaced out with machines that isolate muscles appropriately grouped in the same area. music plays in the background but it's not loud enough to actually enjoy (especially when the guy next to you is throwing weights around) or motivating enough to get you to work harder. the ceilings are high meaning that there's inadequate ventilation. in other words, you get to smell the sweaty guy next to you in all his/her glory. wonderful. trainers: i didn't actually see one trainer walking around the gym. the only employers were the two at the front desk and the people fixing machines. the two ""trainers"" at the front aren't really role models for those trying to lose weight. i'm sorry for having to compare this gym to my home gym in ah but our trainers would run circles around the ones here. machines: this was the highlight of the entire facility. they actually fix their equipment in a timely fashion!!! gym members: i don't profess to be of admirable physique. but, being an athlete for more than three quarters of my life (and having a few body building friends) i know a thing or two about lifting. the guys here, first of all, are much smaller than those back at my gym from home. secondly, the ""big"" guys here don't work put there legs. i think the accepted term is ""chicken"" legs. third, the ""big"" guys tend to stand around and talk a lot. recommendation: i'm always a big supporter of being healthy. please go to a gym or be self motivated to keep healthy."
4-star,1,"as a recent resident of north las vegas, i was happy to find a 24 hour fitness within driving distance from my house. i was not expecting ""the best"" of conditions because some 24 hour fitness locations can be a total let-down. however, when i walked into this 24 i was impressed. yeah, i've seen better, but usually when they are better they are also packed and you have to wait for machines. i've never had an issue with anything that i want to use being taken. there are so many options and the place is nice and open. the bathroom/locker room area wasn't uncleanly when i was there and i've never had trouble finding a locker either. the only thing i would change is the size of the tvs in the cardio area. i have great vision, but even so, if i am 2 rows away from the tv i can't see the score of the game because it's too small. otherwise, the staff is friendly, the place is clean, and you have options. i approve!"
1-star,0,"what good is ""24 hour fitness free 7-day pass"" when they won't honor it... 24 hr fitness is nationwide, being a local or not should not make a difference when the rates are the same and there are locations available near the following person's address? i work out here often, the staff are friendly, the facilities are adequate, however i had a friend come as a guest. she called in advance to see if she would be eligible under my guest pass, which i did not have on hand, the person on the phone said shouldn't be a problem, they would take care of her. when we got there, the manager, name starting with ""v"" (not sure if i can mention people's names on here), said that she couldn't work out under my guest pass because she was not local, she explained to him that the person on the phone said it was fine & he told her that she was lying because there was no record of the phone call on their hand written phone log. she asked him if he would make an exception since we had made a long trip to the gym & we were told that it would be ok & she also told him how she too was a personal trainer for bally's.. he started to get very snarky & condescending & told her there was a reason why bally's was down the hole. so i stepped in to tell him that there was no need for him to be rude & that his attitude was poor and condescending. i asked him if there was a day fee we could just pay so we could go work out together, he told me the price in which case i handed him the cash which he took. my friend asked for the paperwork she filled out back because she didn't feel that they needed her personal info since they would not allow her to use my guest pass, & he wouldn't give it back, so she grabbed it herself. he told her he was going to call the cops & she couldn't work out. and he reluctantly gave back my money. he should not be a manager if he can't be nice & professional, instead he was rude & defensive & out right unacceptable behavior. even his staff member apologized to us when he walked off."
2-star,0,"when you're away from the strip and need to get some exercise, there is not much around. luckily, you can sometimes just run into a 24 hour fitness like i did. i first tried to go to what appeared to be a location right off the 95 fwy near ann, but it had not been constructed yet. i drove around and found this location on craig and it must have been an active. i did not see any indication of its grade. there was no pool meaning it's probably not a sport. if it was an active, it was a large active with several free weight benches, treadmills, bikes, and workout stations. there was nothing appealing about this place,. the interior was not run down but somehow the location was just not appealing and seemed obscure and hidden and made you want to leave as soon as you've finished working out. 2.5 stars."
5-star,1,out of town looking for a gym. i'm glad i found this place. they have everything you can think of. very clean facility. its not a place where everyone sits around on there phones. i will always come back when i'm in town.
5-star,1,"background of my review: * i'm a morning weight-training individual * i go to the gym 4 times a week * i've been going to this gym since march 2018 gym has what i want: just the right amount of free-weight equipment, relatively cool environment, a weight scale. things i really like: + two places where i can do barbell squats + three places (inclusive of the above) where i can do barbell deadlifts i mention the above since those are usually the places that i would experience ""traffic"", but again, i'm a morning person. one down side (which isn't enough to downgrade my rating) was an off-weekend during memorial day when they had limited hours due to carpet cleaning. it wasn't published early enough, so basically i went to the gym in a saturday when they were already closed."
5-star,1,this gym is amazing. it is inexpensive and has all the weights and cardio equipment any serious athlete will need. there are even punching bags! this gym is also quite empty which is great since there is no waiting to use certain equipments. we went on a sunday and there was only less than 6 people in the entire place. lexi at the front desk was incredibly helpful too. she was very friendly and addressed all our needs.
5-star,1,i was very impressed with this facility. it is easily the best gym i've belonged to. going from a big name gym where you feel like all they want is your membership to here is a big difference. the atmosphere is great and the owner is a wonderful person. i moved recently so i had to stop going here but i am going to miss it greatly. this is the best place i've ever worked out. keep up the good work!
5-star,1,this gym is awesome. everyone (especially matt the owner) is so friendly and helpful. i would recommend this gym to anyone.
5-star,1,"i've been going here for about 2-3 months now and i love it! it's never super busy, everything is clean, great selection of cardio and weight lifting machines. plenty of space to lift without feeling cramped. the employees are all super awesome. matt is great and always in a helpful and positive mood. it's also an inexpensive gym compared to your typical la fitness or anytime fitness. you can definitely hire a personal trainer if preferred, though i haven't. highly recommend this place!"
5-star,1,"this gym is amazing! they have all the right equipment, trainers and classes to allow you to become the best you can be. the owner truly understands what it takes to create a friendly neighborhood gym where people feel welcome and appreciated. the monthly membership fees are extremely affordable. the gym hours are also amenable to just about anyone's schedule. if you are in need of a personal trainer, massage therapist, physical therapist, nutritionist, or just about anyone involved in the creation of a more improved version of yourself, he is the guy to point you in the right direction by referring you to one of his many fitness specialists. i highly recommend this gym to anyone who is tired of the over priced, overly busy, chain gyms. fantastic gym. a much appreciated addition to the community."
5-star,1,"love this gym! friendliest folks (everyone who works here is warm and welcoming, everyone who works out here is friendly) and the place is incredibly clean!"
5-star,1,"it's always immaculately clean, has a great equipment selection, is rarely over-crowded, and has an awesome owner! matt is the best, and always greets you with a smile! feels homey. also love that there are no contracts involved, and you can cancel your membership at anytime (not as if i ever will). totally worth the $20/month."
5-star,1,my name is marc and i recently joined this gym i am also a member of planet youfit eos mountainside why so many gyms because their all missing something but here at 7th st they got it all for just 20 bucks a month with no down no yearly just 20 bucks a month so if your cheap like me but you also want an amazing gym to get yourself where you want it to be then this the place .....
5-star,1,"let's start by laying out the facts! 90% of gyms are based on either selling you memberships or enticing you to come in based on low cost memberships. not this gym!! it's a simple 19.95 a month with no contracts or down payment! they have wifi and a great app that allows you to engage with your gym! at 7th street gym, the first thing that will hit you is value!! the equipment, the energy, the entire staff, the ambience and lastly the genuine smile a greeting you will get when you frost walk in from matt sloan! not to mention the amazing cloud plastered floors! 7th street gym truly has it all!! tanning, better health shots, versa spa systems, red light treatment, zumba, yoga, wake up with jake classes, cryotherapy,personal nutrition and training by jake elston, amazing equipment and the entire amazing staff of trainers. tia-chase-chris-juan--don-andrew-jake-josiah and kim! i truly look forward to hitting 7th street gym everyday and i promise you will too!!"
5-star,1,visiting from out of town and this gym blew me away! more than enough equipment for any serious body builder and awesome staff! will be back and highly recommend!
5-star,1,great workout and staff!! craig remembers every name and is an expert at customizing the work outs to your personal activity level and athletic abilities. no two work outs are the same and i love that i can monitor my heart rate- i burn as many calories in 30mins at 9round as i do in 60mins at other popular work out studios! 9round is a very high-energy workout that is flexible (no appointment needed!) and fun! i would highly recommend this 9round studio!!
5-star,1,"i've been part of many gyms but never have stuck with them (crossfit, y, barre)- 9round is the only gym routine i have been doing consistently for years. it's fun, fast, and varies every single day- you won't be bored! i really love craig and the trainers here. craig is probably one of the most positive guys i have ever met- he will remember your name next time you come. i go in the mornings and have gone at lunch and never had an issue getting in a round to exercise. try it out!! first time is free!! (if you're nervous about coming in try going in late morning through lunch- it's not so busy)."
5-star,1,"i am not a current member of 9 round but i go sporadically through classpass. after one visit to 9 round, craig knew my name and even remembered some of my strengths and weaknesses. this 9 round is absolutely incredible. passion is the first word that comes to mind when i think of this location and craig. he is an amazing trainer and quite possibly one of the most encouraging trainers i have had. he takes the time to explain form and technique, something that i have found to be very rare. i feel lifted up and empowered after a class. the setup is just like every 9 round....9 rounds for 3 minutes each. i love the concept behind being able to come and workout at whatever time works for you. if my current workout regimen changes and i need to start working out closer to home, i won't hesitate to become a member here. excellent facility, excellent workout, incredible instructor."
5-star,1,"this is a great gym!! the workouts are so fun and the time flies by. craig, the owner/trainer, knows everyone's name and makes everyone feel welcome! the first class is free, so you can try it before you buy a membership. definitely recommend!!"
5-star,1,"awesome trainer/owner that ensures that you are doing the exercises correct. clean space, great workout! highly recommend."
5-star,1,"i can't say enough good things about this gym. the workouts are extremely challenging, but very doable. everyday the workout is different, so i never felt bored. if you are looking to lose weight, give their 6 week fitness challenge a try. the trainers will work with you on meal planning and support through the challenge in addition to working with you in the gym. in my challenge, i lost over 30 lbs. the results are real. this gym can get it done- 30 minutes at a time!"
5-star,1,"i hate working out (i mean hate it) but i love 9round! the trainers keep me motivated and the 3 minute rounds make it easier to make it through. every time i think i'm not going to make it through the round, the 30 second warning beeps and i know i can push myself harder for just that much longer. the heart rate monitors are awesome and help me motivate myself to push and burn more calories (it sends you a workout summary after every visit). i haven't stuck with working out this long in my entire life and i don't plan on quitting anytime soon! this is what i've been looking for. thanks 9round!!"
5-star,1,"a few months ago, i accepted the 9rounds 6 week fitness challenge @ 9 rounds university. after 20 years of taking care of my athletes, students, my son, etc., i finally needed to take care of me. as a former professional baseball player, i am no stranger to weightlifting, cardio and overall fitness. the years took their toll, however, and i found myself looking in the mirror at a person i wasn't proud to see. i accepted the challenge with trepidation, wondering if 25 lbs was actually attainable in such a short period of time.....but i went all in and did everything full throttle. as a result, not only did i complete the challenge....but i won it in one month! i lost 25.4 lbs in just 30 days! at the end of the challenge, i had conquered the challenge and lost 34.4 lbs....and that is only the beginning of my journey. i have lost another few pounds since and intend to double that total in the near future, returning to the healthy man i used to be. simply put, 9rounds university changed my life...and probably helped save it long-term. i can't thank wendy (my personal coach in this journey), maria, sarah and all the trainers for their support and encouragement. don't waste another second at a gym where you try to figure out what to do.....9rounds is a gamechanger. i am becoming a full-time member now that the challenge is over and can't imagine anywhere i'd rather be. join the 9rounds family......i guarantee you won't regret it!"
1-star,0,i did not have a good experience at 9round-university. i gave it one star for the location which is very convenient to my house. if you decide to give them a try do not give them your credit card. they will try to scam you by saying since you are utilizing the facility and our equipment we have to hold on to your credit card for collateral which is b.s. they ran my card a couple of weeks after i gave them a test run for a week and they decided to charge my card after telling them i'm not interested. who does that?? what made me change my mind also was there was only one person overseeing the whole gym and he didn't care 2 squats about my safety. being a first timer exposed to a punching bag and other equipment i could of done some damage to myself. he did not wrap my hands before i put on the gloves. really!! do yourself a favor and consider another fitness facility.
5-star,1,"let's be clear...i despise working out as much as i despise dieting but i love going to 9round (i like leaving there even more...lol!). i love that the trainers know my name when i walk in. the trainers are attentive without being overbearing, the workouts are really intense and because the workouts are only 30mins, i have no excuse to not go. i just renewed my membership at the location at arbor creek for the 3rd time this past weekend and i couldn't be happier. see you guys tomorrow!"
5-star,1,"the staff is amazing! they're always encouraging and upbeat. the music while working out is high energy too, which goes perfectly with the intense, but fun workout. love it here!"
5-star,1,i love 9round!! i've been a member since november of 2013 and can't think of a better place for a busy person to go and get addicted to working out. the trainers have become like family and you feel welcomed when you come inside. not like a big box gym where no one even knows your name. you're motivated to push yourself every workout. the events that the owners host for members throughout the year set this gym apart from any other gym community that's out there!
4-star,1,"9round in the university area was a great place, and the first that i miss (having moved from the area). my coworker and i started going to support each other, then we both had to stop going secondary to doctors ""suggestions"". the owner was very nice, but a trainer by the name of cj stands out because he was always helpful, attentive, and knew i was trying to hide when it was time to run around the building. he was a big encouragement, and the rest of the staff were nice as well."
2-star,0,"i initially didn't go much when i signed my contract because i felt uncomfortable putting my gloves and wraps on.. the coaches didn't have time to really spend time with me one on one since they were busy coaching everyone else. i signed a 9month contract and have been out of town a lot due to a new job. so now i have to pay month to month until i can physically go in to give a 30day notice since my contract is up now. however, i'm out of town and they won't let me just call in to do it. wendy wasn't very pleasant and not very concerned with my situation. i'm paying month to month for nothing. try out another gym. i enjoy crossfit since there's no contracts, coaches spend one on one time with you, and the community is extremely close. plus, workouts are awesome! basically 9rounds plus more.. just remember customer service is everything. if a gym doesn't care about me personally, then i'll go elsewhere. although the workouts are good, i would rather workout where i feel like people care and where i'm comfortable."
5-star,1,this place will definitely whip just about anyone into shape! i've been a member since they opened back in april 2013. the owners and trainers truly give me the individual attention i need in a group setting so it really feels like i have my own set of personal trainers. keep up the great work 9round!
4-star,1,"i'm usually here at this location for one of my kids sporting events but overall the facility is great in terms of coming to workout using the nautilus equipment or even if you're planning to come to the pool as this is one of the few locations in the valley where the pool is open year-round. the staff always has information on hand to let you know about upcoming events and the two young adult areas are a great place and location for the kids to play. if you're an all-valley member of the ymca or just specific to one location, this is a great place to come as the basketball gym facility is also great and has plenty of seating to allow for parents and other family members to watch the game. be careful of the parking lot and follow the signs as the traffic flow route & parking is odd & takes you towards the front and then around. with people trying to get in or out, it's a little bit confusing when i come through. class schedule activities are always good as people try to stay as active as possible. if you live out in the foothhills and are looking for a gym facility like with quality equipment, this one is definitely a recommendation as it supports the valley youth with positive programs."
1-star,0,the child care program at the ymca is a terrible place for your children. my child was bullied when he was supposed to be uplifted. when i approached the staff they did nothing. the chain of command is terrible as well. they do no investigations on allegations that occur at their facility they go off the word of a teacher. so if they were dishonest and your child is telling the truth it is impossible to get them to admit fault. do not trust this facility with your children and if you already have you need to pull them before they get hurt and you will be the one to pay because of the membership waiver you signed. please hear my warning when i say the ymca in foothills is an untrustworthy place.
1-star,0,"after getting in 4 times before as a guest, i had to pay $10 to get a guest pass. the woman who helped me was very rude, after this experience i might as well move to lifetime."
5-star,1,"i'm giving 5 stars to two great employees: 1. olivia 2. julyen i have not always had great service in the 3 years i have been a member here, but in the last year there have been some improvements in service, particularly from 2 great front desk personalities. olivia and julyen have made an effort to know and greet me and my family, they smile, and they wish us a good day as we exit the facility. this may seem like a small thing, but in a world with so few caring, considerate people, it really brightens my day. the facility can still do so much more to promote proper etiquette and availability in the free weight section of the gym, but the child care and front desk are so much improved. thanks!"
5-star,1,"their aquatics director blake is amazing! she cares so much about he kids, is a fantastic coach and the lifeguards are so professional."
1-star,0,"i'm about to terminate memebership. i only joined because of the location. very inefficient use of real estate. lack of free weights and nowhere for deadlifts. yet, there's a ""circuit training"" room in the back no one uses. room in gym area converted into an office for director who i never see. members lack etiquette, and desk and management are unresponsive to complaints for fear of confronting entitled soccer moms and other similarly clueless clientele. i'm clearly not the demographic they want to serve and feel like a second class citizen here. the lincoln downtown ymca is outstanding and i'll miss it. terminating soon because this ymca is awful."
5-star,1,"i don't have a lot of experience with gyms, so take that into consideration when reading this review. my wife has been attending this gym for about a year now and loves it. her favorite perk is the kids care. they allow you 2 hours of supervised care for your kids while you do anything in the facility. sometimes she just drops them off and works on her laptop in the lobby. she loves the classes like weight lifting, insanity, spin. i've only done the yoga class and for a rookie it was very easy to follow along though i did learn that i have zero flexibility. i typically spend time in the gym area with the machines. all the machines seem to be in excellent condition and everyone also seems courteous when using them. the y draws a more mature crowd, so perhaps that helps. there are a few sanitizing wipe stations to clean the machine down after use. there are windows everywhere, ceiling to floor, so plenty of natural light. there are at least 25 treadmills and less ellipticals. these fill up by about 9:30-10. they are really nice ones that connect with tvs on wall in front that are all on different stations. the locker room is pretty plain. just the bare necessities. maybe i'm just a shampoo snob, but the shampoo feels more like gas station hand soap which means i have to start bringing my own. minor inconvenience. the towels barely fit around my waist, so the could be bigger. they do have a swimsuit spinner that spins your suit almost dry. other areas i haven't used: swimming pool, young adult reading/chill area. we get a discount through my wife's work which makes it very reasonable rate."
5-star,1,"i'm a coach for the boys 1st and 2nd basketball team and i have to say that i'm happy to coach here and be apart of a wonderful program. i thank the ymca for allowing me to coach for 2 years. i've had nothing but great experiences. if you're looking for a program to put your kids in whether it's basketball, swim, volleyball, etc. i recommend giving the ymca a try."
1-star,0,"avoid this place if you're serious about fitness. the pool is great but the weight area is extremely small and always a mess. weights are strung all over the machines/benches and certain habitual offenders never pick up after themselves. after a year of putting up with basically a coed curves, my wife and i are headed elsewhere along with our $84 a month member fees."
5-star,1,i have been going to this ymca for over 4 years and i am still as in love with it as i was on day 1. there are so many friendly employees and the classes are the best! the instructors are so amazing and no matter what your fitness level is they accommodate you and help you do your best.
1-star,0,"don't waste you fees here if you desire use of a gym. during the weekday prime hours 5pm-9pm weekdays and all day during weekends, it is booked for teams. it shouldn't label itself as ahwatukee ""family ymca"", more accurately, ""sports-team-exclusive ymca"""
1-star,0,"for someone who just folds towels and scans membership cards, the lady with the curly hair sure was rude when i asked her where the bathroom was . mind you this is my first time at a ymca gym. she acted as if my 1 second question was keeping her too occupied to fold towels ."
5-star,1,"the facility is top notch! and the staff are all so nice!!! they are the reason i so enjoy going there everyday. and all of the group fitness instructors are extremely motivating and really sweet! and the child center staff are all amazing!! they light up when they see my daughter walk in. that makes it very easy for me to enjoy my workout. like i said, every single person that works there are super friendly... the front desk staff, fitness instructors, child center staff, etc. the facility is always really clean too! and i never have to wait for a cardio machine."
5-star,1,"my entire family are in and out of this building throughout the week. staff is friendly and inviting. ahwatukee is very lucky to have such a great facility at their disposal. a great place to work out, swim, climb a rock wall etc. the kids love it ! the wife loves it ! i love it ! enough said."
5-star,1,"i'm not your typical ""gym rat"" but this place is nice. it is always clean and never overly crowded. a bike, treadmill or elliptical can always be found even during the busy hours. there are not any juice heads hear grunting constantly so that's nice. it is amusing seeing the ahwatukee house wives walking around with diamonds the size of eyeballs sometimes. the staff is always friendly and accomodating, jill is the best though. she always has a smile on her face and can answer any questions that you have...she's awesome! its not like lifetime fitness, but its not $100 a month either."
4-star,1,"there are three main reasons i love this ymca. 1.) it is super close to home. this alone gets me to the gym. 2.) it has amazing childcare staff. ms. erica and her team are so great with the kids. it is a program for up to age 7. my neighbors all belong to this gym because they know their kids are in good hands. they even have a once a month parents' night out event for $20 that is from 5-9pm on a random saturday. the kids get to watch a movie and have pizza. they also get to go into the gym and go wild throwing balls - they seem to love this part. 3.) their fitness classes are great and are included in the membership price. the only reason i am not giving the ymca 5 stars is that they charge more for memberships based on zip codes. just because i live in a historically more affluent zip code does not mean i want to pay nearly three times the amount to work out here. it makes me want to kick myself for not joining the y when i lived downtown. it would have saved me about 65 bucks every month! overall, i love this ymca. i haven't checked out their really cool pool yet... but that's only because i am not in bathing suit shape! give me a few months and maybe you will see me at the pool. :)"
2-star,0,"my husband and i have been members of the ahwatukee y for many years and this month we were charged an additional $20 with no notice of the increase or further information. i tried to get pricing on the internet for the valley y's, but it is not available. so i called the general information number and was told the price increased to $75 in this demographic area. each y charges a different price and now you have to pay a premium to go to another y in the valley (at least that is what i was told!). in the past we have supported the y by donating to them through the valley of the sun united way, etc. but i think this is unfair marketing tactics depending on who you talk to on the phone. one woman even said i had to belong to the one nearest my house even if i wanted to go to one near a place of employment! i called the tempe y and they said their price is $80 for two people, but my friends in mesa pay $38. i think the phoenix ymca needs to simplify their marketing techniques and make it fair for those on fixed incomes, with no families, no need for the pools, no need for classes, rock wall etc. all we want to do is use the treadmill a couple times a week. i am ready to quit, but my husband wants to continue, so we will see....."
5-star,1,"i think it had been about 36 years since i had set foot in a ymca before i joined this branch last summer. i didn't remember much about the last time other than tile--lots and lots of blue tile. oh, and feeling like i was almost drowning. my early swimming experiences weren't pleasant. so, i was a bit dubious when my sister suggested i join and talked about the place as though it were a palace of some kind. hell, it's a ymca . . . you know . . . . ewww . . . well, this location in ahwatukee is not quite a palace, but as gyms go it's pretty damn close. just working out today i noticed that although the construction materials are just about what you'd find in a warehouse, the design makes the main gym hall feel like human space. that must be hard to do with a gym since so many other designs get it wrong. a lot of thought and inspiration went into the architecture here, and it shows. the heated beach-entry pool has totally entranced my little 4-year-old, as has the active water sculpture-thing in the pool, which he can activate all by himself just by pushing a button. there are not only dressing rooms for each gender set up with direct access to the pool, but one set aside for families. that one also has its own access to the pool area. the machines are up-to-date and kept in good repair. this location uses the fixlinxx tracking system i've talked about elsewhere. there's a dedicated spinning room and a separate set of the simple ""grampy-style"" weight machines (at least that's what i call them). help is friendly and plentiful, and in joining you get a fitness consultation that actually seems to be cluefull. the trainers and employees manage to treat people as adults and not as children or draft inductees. both hand and bath towels are provided free of charge. the childcare area is palatial as well, with plenty of toys and places to climb. the hours of coverage are ample. the girls and women who watch the kids actually act as though they enjoy their work. and the atmosphere is a relief in that it's family- (and not douchebag- or creepazoid- ) centered. that's not to offend any douchebags or creepazoids out there. i'm sure there are places for you, too. in fact, i know there are. the crowd is neither very young nor very old, and no one seems to be intent upon laddering-up to the top of the gym social order. about the only drawback to this place is that there are no benches in the locker rooms. oh, and it can also get quite crowded at prime times, though not as badly as the la fitness location i also use. it's definitely one of the better values in gyms in the area, and that's not even taking into account the opportunities for kid's sports and swim lessons, etc."
5-star,1,"this review is specifically for melanie's zumba class. the class is the most fun i have ever had working out. women are shaking their butts, the classes are always full and everyone is having a great time. if melanie ever leaves, i will cancel my membership!"
1-star,0,"if i could give negative stars, i would. the manager was a little rude when showing the facilities to my friend and me. he guaranteed us a 7 day trial period where we could cancel our membership if we chose not to continue with the membership. it has been 3 months since i cancelled and i am still being charged... i have called in to correct this and it hasn't changed. any time i go into the facilities myself, the manager is not available at the time. i am a college student who is not looking to get $65 taken out of my account every month when i don't have a key fob or access to a gym that i am not using and am not interested in using. there are way better gyms around the madison area. it's even worth the bus ride to go to planet fitness or the nat instead of the small, overpriced, unfair excuse of a gym on east campus mall. terrible."
2-star,0,"the overall space is small and can get crowded especially during peak hours (which is expected, but definitely worse here). however it is convenient for folks who work on campus and accessible via its location. i'm not particularity fond of the staff. i've had two instances where both staff persons were rude and didn't seem interested to ask if i needed any help. i once asked a staff member about a pair of clothes i left in one of the restrooms and she responded rudely and in a snobby tone - that nothing had been dropped off to her that day. the customer service at this location is poor and don't seem to give a damn about anything that goes on in the facility. the bathrooms are pretty dirty and seems to only be cleaned every once in a while."
1-star,0,"i have had trouble with my personal training contract and billing payments ever since i started. they constantly try to take money out of my account without giving me personal training sessions. it's annoying and frustrating to have to complain to them all the time about their horrible billing and money practices. like the other user who complained, they make a lot of promises about fixing the problems they create, but they don't follow through. run away from this gym - run like the wind!"
3-star,0,the location is convenient for students or anyone who works downtown. it's located on the campus mall with easy access to bike racks. i like being an anytime fitness member but this particular location can get pretty crowded and i wish there was more room between the lifting machines. the place is clean though and i feel safe leaving my purse in the cubby whole i work out.
2-star,0,"this gym is extremely tiny and because it is so tiny it is really difficult to get time on equipment. it's like working out in a overly crowded garage. (there are plenty of treadmills though) it is very expensive for such a small ill equipped gym. $39 a month plus a large set up fee with a ridiculous contract. this gym does not have enough equipment. in fact there are no traditional bench presses and they expect you to do bench from the squat rack. there are only three squat racks. it is terribly difficult to secure a squat rack. there are zero lockers. they have an honor system for your stuff to not be stolen which makes me uncomfortable. there is also no supplements for sale either. for $39 one would think anytime fitness would have bars, shakes and supplements to buy for workouts. speaking of honor, these people have none. i told the manager nick hansen i move for business constantly and did not want to be locked in on the contract in case i move, which i probably would move. he promised and assured me it would not be an issue if i had a drivers license with a different address. i told him i would give my old arizona drivers license and use my oregon drivers license one if i needed to cancel. when i went in to cancel he lied and told me i needed a ""newly"" formed drivers license. it is quite frustrating to deal with unscrupulous persons lying and saying anything to get someone to sign up and then when the person tries to leave they lie again to try and get them to keep paying. has anyone ever heard of karma? heard of doing the right thing? if the management was not bad enough by itself, the tiny space with the minuscule variety of equipment to get in shape really sharpens the picture here- worst gym i have ever encountered"
4-star,1,"so... just wondering... when will this be rectified?? the doors are always left open, the music from the class clashes with the overhead music, and the instructor's 'whoops' and 'yelps' are incredibly distracting .... there's little to no respect for everyone else trying to focus and work-out. i'm trying to be patient, but nothing has been done about it after all this time."
5-star,1,"i'm very happy with this gym. it's clean, and the staff is always friendly and ready to help. i work out with travis, who is an amazing trainer. i've had really great results, and he's always positive and encouraging. taylor, at the office, is always great too."
1-star,0,"i'm not impressed, for many reasons. it's a chain corporate gym but i'm not holding that against them. it is always clean and well maintained. overpriced wifi never works limited equipment staff completely uninterested i'm a manager of a gym and a competitive bodybuilder and needed a gym close to home to supplement my cardio. i was excited when anytime opened because it's just a few minutes from my house. i've been a member for several months and have recently cancelled. i have talked to staff members and management about these and other concerns to no response. within a few minutes from my house, though not as convenient, is a la fitness, ufit, knockout fitness and maybe more if i look. so i'm going elsewhere. but if your looking for 24 hour access, willing to pay a lot for it, and are okay with limited equipment, then this is a gym for you."
5-star,1,"this is a very nifty medium sized fitness center with an excellent variety of modern equipment (cardio, weight machines, etc.). the facilities are open to members 24/7 and the facilities are super clean. i have been to the anytime fitness facilities in phoenix, glendale, and tucson. all of them are excellent and very pleasant to use. well done anytime fitness."
5-star,1,this gym is awesome it's really clean looks like all of the machines are brand-new and it's five times larger than the one i work out in kentucky
1-star,0,"i am convinced this gym has never been cleaned. i've been to many other anytime fitness locations and this seems like an entirely different gym and company. dust and dirt everywhere, old sweat left on machines. i took my shoes off to do squats and had to throw my socks away because they were so black and dirty."
5-star,1,great gym! feels like home. the people are friendly and the staff is very helpful. there's a good selection of equipment and is all in good shape.
5-star,1,"this facility is great. the manager camron is very professional, knowledgeable and friendly. he always greets with a warm smile. he does a great job of maintaining this facility. i highly recommend this gym!"
1-star,0,"i've been waiting until i had worked out here for a few months to write a review so i could get a long term perspective of it. in short, this is my least favorite location for anytime fitness. the gym doesn't appear to have been deep cleaned in years. the equipment is grimy and dusty with large piles of dirt underneath many machines. bathroom space is minimal and continually gross, often running out of paper towels on weekends. i don't see many people wiping down equipment and it often stinks in here. i've even seen staff members use equipment and not wipe down. the tv situation has no excuse. basic broadcast stations if you're lucky. no gym should be without espn. i use the place 3-4 times per week because it's close to my work. if this had been my first experience with the club, i'd have gone elsewhere. i've been coming here for a year now and i can't believe how disgusting this place is. in one of the restrooms there is crusted feces around the base of the toilet that has been there the entire time i've been using this gym. the equipment is still continually dirty with dust and hair and no one cleans at all on weekends. regardless of cleaning schedule, whom ever is tasked with cleaning doesn't do a thorough job. i've yelped, spoken with staff, and emailed anytime corporate with zero effect. my conclusion is that the owners just don't care. arcadia and central scottsdale locations are spotless and worth the money. chandler is in a word, foul."
5-star,1,"not sure why there are so many bad reviews, it looks like it may have a new owner now. the gym is fairly well equipped. there are actually 2 squat racks and a smith machine. there is the wood and rubbery type flooring for one of the squat racks for doing deadlifts and such. the place is always super clea. there is a separate room for classes but its always empty when i'm there so its good for stretching and things like that, away from the main weight room. there are few cons--there is no vending machine for pre-workout drinks, ya know, in case you are in a jam and forgot yours or are just dragging that day. the other thing is that there is a lot of space--they definitely could fit more equipment in the future if they optimized the spacing."
1-star,0,"i was rudely yelled at by the female trainer, as i was in the studio room with some friends (we are members of anytime) and we were doing posing for our fitness show. she said we couldn't be in there doing that,which i think she was upset that we were posing for another competition organization not npc, as she is part of npc. she had gotten into a big argument with me. we were only going to be there for 30 min and got kicked out before. me or my friends will never come here again. she could have been a lot nicer and we would have left, but instead she was rude. beware."
1-star,0,"horrible place, i just wanted to get some info and was talked to so rudely by a woman who was ""teaching a class"" and basically told me to get out. not a good start and a few of my friends say they went here for awhile and it's really slipped. i wouldn't waste your time or money here"
1-star,0,"this review is based on their collectors. they took over fitness forum (a longtime family owned joint). i cancelled my membership with fitness forum over a year ago. i didn't notice they were still charging me. when i called to ask them about it, they advised me to file a claim with my bank and apologized for the inconvenience. fast forward to 3 months ago when i started receiving harassing phone calls from 800.897.6877 and letters saying i owe for a month's membership for anytime fitness, a gym i've never even stepped foot into. i cancelled fitness forum because i was doing a lot of travelling - now that i am in the market to join another gym i can safely say that anytime fitness will not be considered. what a bummer that such a friendly gym is now just another big box chain here in my hometown. :("
1-star,0,"probably one of the worst locations i've been to. i cancelled because this was the closest location to me and was hot, smelly and lacked free weights. the owner was also creepy and knew my name before he introduced himself. not sure if he looked in the system or what but i don't like working out when i feel like i'm being watched."
5-star,1,"awesome staff! love erica. jason is super. they are helping me stay on my triathlon training regimen while in chandler, az for several weeks from alabama. love this place! i'll be back often to visit my new grand-daughter an this is where i'll continue my elite masters triathlon gym training."
5-star,1,"this place rocks! the owner and staff were amazing, easy to work with, and helped my wife and i achieve our fitness goals with just the right support. they support and honor military families and the gym has everything you need for autosmoke.."
1-star,0,"pro's gym is clean equipment is adequate and in good working order 24 hour access con's the owner jay bru is a scum bag liar and i would avoid doing business with this man at all costs. i joined this gym on a month to month membership because i knew i was going to be moving out of the area in a few months and couldn't get locked into a long term contract. to have this luxury i was paying a pretty big premium of over 40.00 dollars a month in order to cancel at anytime. when the time came for me to cancel i called the gym and got jay. i informed him i needed to cancel my membership and he asked me to call back when some female was working. he said he didn't know how to cancel it (he's the owner mind you) ok fair enough i'll call back. i call back another day when he told me to, he answers again i ask for the other employee he says she's not there. i insist on canceling my membership with him instead of playing this game of continuing to call back. he says ok then he starts to tell me they don't do month to month memberships and he's going to charge me 150.00 dollars. i tell him no i am not paying 150.00 dollars to cancel my membership that i had been paying a premium each month for the right to cancel at anytime. then he tells me he can't find my contract and i must belong to another location. we continue to go back and forth before he finally says he will cancel my membership. so after a week and multiple phone calls and half a dozen lies from jay he finally cancelled my membership. after reading this if you are dumb enough to do business with this lying douchebag you better hang onto your copy of the contract."
5-star,1,"awesome staff, and i love the gym mascot! kass the booty pump instructor is so knowledgeable. really makes sure that we're doing the correct form to minimize injury and makes it so fun while doing so. i'm not a member, however, the classes are $5 drop ins, so worth it for the quality training you receive. ab class and botty pump for the win! thank you!!"
5-star,1,"jay (owner) makes the experience in this gym! he is friendly without being pushy. knowledgeable without being a know-it-all. great guy to be around. gym has 24 hour access which i love since i'm always working or with my kids during ""normal"" hours. i definitely recommend this place!"
1-star,0,"do not go there!!!! giving a rating of one star is way too much for the horrible service you get there. i signed up few months ago and the trainer i was ""supposed""to meet up with was never available and the one time i ran into him at the gym he was too busy texting away not even engaged with the conversation. the ""owner"" jay, by far the worst owner. his lack of customer service and knowledge of how to run his business is pathetic! i was charged multiple times for the membership after i had given my 30day notice to cancel and when i reached out to the owner for resolution on reimbursing my money he said he would call me back within an hour. 4 hours went by no call from the owner,when i called him back he was so rude,unprofessional and incompetent to resolve the matter. he tried to rush me off the phone and said he would call me back (yeah right!) once i told him i was going to report him to the bbb he then said he will look into it and email me receipt. still nothing. bbb got a nice report from me and couple other clients that used to go with me and are just as dissatisfied with their lame service. bottom line this place is not worth it in a lot of different aspects. the owner clearly has no idea how to keep clients or even hire professional trainers. dont go there unless u wanna be ignored and mess with your bank account!"
5-star,1,"i was a member of this gym for about a year and half and could not have been happier. jay is a great manager and all of the equipment is well maintained. i travel a lot for work and have been to more than a dozen other anytimes across the country. imo this is the best all around location (there's no place like home). having moved to scottsdale, this gym is too far of a drive now for me. had i stayed in chandler, i never would have left."
5-star,1,anytime fitness is awesome! i will recomend this place to my friends and family. the staff is friendly and the facility is nice and clean. a nice thing about this place is you never have to wait to use a machine. they also have the newest equipment. thank you stefan bryan for recomending me to this place. im glad i made the switch.
5-star,1,"i am guilty of going to big box, cookie cutter, no one knows your name type of gyms. i have spent ungodly amounts of money on personal trainers, monthly memberships, and home equipment. it's exhausting. after giving up on my""big box"" gym down the street because i was tired of donating to their profits, my friend told me to look into anytime fitness. i need the 24 hour gym because i tend to wake up early or go to bed late and dislike having to plan my schedule around a gym. so i sucked it up and decided to give another gym a chance. i am so happy i did. the manager, stefan, was very welcoming and understanding of my ""gym-commitment hesitation."" he explained the different options i had, the different classes they offer, and so forth. i signed up that day and haven't looked back. i like the laid back atmosphere, and like the fact i don't have to deal with the annoying teeny boppers that i had to at other gyms. it's definitely a place people actually go to work out and not the ""tender"" version of a gym. try it out... you won't be sorry!"
1-star,0,"do not go here! it is not worth it! so i signed up for a free trial period, 14 days, i thought cool, i could try it out and see how it goes. well it says that is open 24 hours, but i had to be there when it was staffed, strange right, because if you are 24 hours shouldn't you always be staffed?! but anyway so i went in the next day during the staffed hours, and met the owner, who had this god awful huge dog just running around, then he asks ""you don't like dogs?"" hell no, i don't like dogs, i am looking for a gym not a damn pet smart! anyway, i ask him about the free trial and he tells me that i must put down at $50 deposit for the key?! wtf?! so pretty much there is no ""free trial"" you must pay $50 and then if you don't like it, they will return it to you...bullsh#! so i left and went down to planet fitness and was so impressed with their facility and professionalism (i.e. no dogs) that i decided to just join and only had to pay $1.02 down and the monthly rate is only $19.99, they had a huge facility, and they are 24/7 no gimmicks, no lies! the membership at anytime fitness is damn near $40.00 for a 1 or 2 year contract. so i must say for god's sake go to planet fitness or anywhere else but here. there is not a lot of machines and the management is horrible!!!!"
1-star,0,"this gym has more equipment than any other anytime fitness that i've visited. i read a few of the other reviews and i have to say that i haven't had any issues with trainers attempting to sell me their services. i usually train at night and the trainer is there sometimes, but he has never bugged me or solicited at all. in addition, none of the guys have ever rushed me off equipment. the atmosphere is clean but it's too hot and crowded. the owner hasn't bothered to get the ac serviced. i don't like the location and the price ....plus the fees. it's a little high in my opinion but some of it has to do with the fact that it's 24 hours. and i have to say that i don't think it's fair that the owner is selling 3 month memberships on groupon for $49 which means new members don't have to pay $25 for keys and they don't have to deal with contracts or extra fees which is total bs in my opinion! in addition, the a/c had been having issues the last three weeks. as a result, i haven't been working out as much at this location. it's beyond ridiculous for the amount of money that i pay each month!"
5-star,1,"we were one of the first to sign with anytime in 2012 it was sold to jay bru in 2013. since jay has been the new owner of anytime, the gym has improved 100 percent great staff, people, equipment and just an enjoyable atmosphere. thank you jay for a nice neighborhood gym. steve s p.s. it beats those $10.00 a month foo foo gyms."
1-star,0,"i would not refer this gym to anyone. trainers push you to sign up for their personal training sessions each time you go into the gym. some people just want to go to the gym and not be hassled. even with headphones in, you get tapped on the shoulder. if you don't sign up for your free one time training, calls constantly come in and they question you every time you go into the gym. the end all for me was when i asked for my dates to be changed for my payments. i was told it was no problem and taken care of. first month that my account was overdrawn, i was understanding and emailed jay, the owner for confirmation on the date change. he offered free training session. i declined, just wanted to be refunded the 25$ overdraft fee or even apply it to my account for the next month. jay declined. i tried to be understanding as mistakes can happen and i get that. second time was the kicker for when the funds were taken out on the wrong date, it drained my account so i could not fulfill other financial obligations. when contacting the business owner, his response was offering free training sessions again and made it perfectly clear via email that he only wanted ""his business to grow."" jay did not offer to refund the 25$ overdraft fees, did not offer to put it on as a credit to my account, just wanted me to take these classes/training sessions. after several attempts at just getting the overdraft credited to my account, i finally reported the business to the bbb. clearly he does just want his business to grow and is not looking to help those who are inconvenienced by his financial mistakes. i think i will just go back to la fitness where they were honest, trustworthy, and did not have an environment where you had to avoid eye contact to make sure no one hunted you down to sign up for more services."
4-star,1,"great place great people, trainer nathan is awesome. selection of equipment is top notch. go to place for fast and easy workout"
5-star,1,"this is my first gym membership ever! i had to hop on the bandwagon and i'm glad anytime is my first. i had visited many gyms and anytime was the only atmosphere i really enjoyed. it's not overwhelming and the moment you walk in someone is greeting you (well during office hours). there are rarely more than 5 people working out so machine availability is incredible. i'm a girl so i love my cardio! the machines offer cable/ internet/ and charge my iphone :) the office staff is extremely nice and answer about any question possible. jay is the best, he is always asking how my day is, if there is anything i need and if there is anything i would recommend for the gym. once a week i see jerid, the personal trainer at the gym and he is awesome. i've noticed such a difference in my body and strength, that guy really knows his stuff. plus, on my days off if i want to use a new strength machine, he is willing to show me how it works and make sure i'm not killing myself. if you are looking for a real gym with no gimmicks, nice people and great machine availability this is your place! plus its 24 hour with great parking what are you waiting for?!"
4-star,1,"gosh i really dislike personal reviews, i'm more for the fun ones about how good this dish was or that hotel was plush! but to not write review just isn't me either. haha for the past 2 years i have been on a weight lost journey, i'm 22 pounds away from saying i have lost 100 pounds in 2 years, doing this by watching what i eat, counting calories, and working out, no fad diets for me, and up until march i have been doing this either at the gym within my complex or would meet up with a friend at his gym in phoenix. but after i moved in march i no longer had access to a gym and started looking at where i would like to go, there are so many choices people can pick but i went with anytime fitness, mainly picked them because it's anytime! 24/7 and that right there works with my scheduled. so i called down and told them i am interested in joining the gym, the available times they had during the week were not great for me, so they made an appointment that works for me on a sat morning. i got the gym sat and i noticed on the door it said the office is closed on the weekends and when i met up with jay, the owner, he said they are closed on the weekends but made this appointment for me so i can check them out! see i like that, this is a personable gym, jay is amazing, and he is sweet and helpful and jarod who is also amazing, is there is help out with any questions and if need personal training you should hit him up and it's not bad pricing either! this gym is new, it's very clean, and has everything you can think of, and of course the hours are whenever you need them to be. with my crazy schedule my hours are late in the evening, and i feel very safe being there, the parking lot is right outside the door, no one can come in unless they have the key, the doors are locked at all times and there are cameras everywhere. if you're not into a gym that actually cares how you're doing, what your goals are, and offer tips on how to get there, then this isn't the place for you. but if you like the personal touch, then go see jay! i'm happy i did!"
5-star,1,"we emailed our previous gym a list of questions the owner/front desk unable to answer/never responded. i sent the same list of questions to the owner of sunrays and he responded in less than 24 hours with the appropriate answers. here are the questions- 1. what are the facility's safety policies and procedures? are there regular safety and maintenance checks of the equipment? 2. how long has oasis been in operation? 3. how often is the facility cleaned? is the equipment ever cleaned? 4. what sort of insurance coverage does membership include, and what fees are necessary for full coverage? if any injury occurs does the facility guarantee full treatment, both upon occurrence and through rehabilitation? 5. do the team coaches have gymnastics coaching certificates? 6. are the coaches trained in first aid and cpr? 7. how many years of coaching experience do the coaches have? in particular, experience coaching children. 8. are lesson plans available? all of the coaches introduced themselves. i know their first and last names and their experience. after each class they say goodbye and tell you had your daughter did. everyone is friendly, responds to emails, phone calls in a timely manner. welcoming and really enjoy their jobs. i have two daughters enrolled in their classes and both really enjoy it and have had major improvements. the facility is cleaned 7 days a week. looks clean and smells clean!"
1-star,0,"i called on friday about the new arcadia location and spoke with the front desk who told me they didn't have any classes at that location on friday. she informed me about the rest of the schedule and that they had an open gym there on sundays from 11 to 12. so i planned my sunday around taking my daughter there, only to get there and it's closed. so i call again and the front desk (it must automatically transfer to the other location) is confused why no one is there, ensuring me someone should be there. she takes my number and says she will call the director and get right back to me. a few minutes later, someone (the director maybe) calls me back and says that place isn't open today. they in fact don't even have any open gym days. it's now 11:15 and she tells me i can come up to the main location and pay for open gym there until noon. ummm my timing might be off, but driving to there other location at this point would give me about 10 minutes of gym time for my daughter. and when i mention this to the women she gets pretty rude. i get it. your staff screwed up, but at least be apologetic. not once did she say sorry for the mix up or take any blame. considering i was about to drop like $100 on toddler classes a month here, i'm glad i found out how this place treats people first. i'll spend my money elsewhere."
5-star,1,"we had my son's 3rd bday party here yesterday and it went so much better than i imagined it. the party went smooth, without a glitch. the party host took care of everything, they were great with the kids and the planned activities and were so friendly and pleasant. we had several different ages and they had something for everyone and they all thoroughly enjoyed it! our guests all complimented us on the party. i highly recommend having a party here!"
5-star,1,"i would give them ten stars if i could!! we are not members of the gym, but stumbled across the sunrays while researching options for our daughter's 4th birthday. from start to finish, the experience was nothing short of spectacular. erin helped with our booking and made it incredibly easy right from the beginning by answering all of my questions in great detail. amber and maria were our party hostesses and the kids had an absolute blast with them. they were friendly, helpful and super efficient in the setup and tear down of the party, clearly pros at what they do. i would absolutely recommend this space for a kids party (heck, i'd have a grown up party there!)."
5-star,1,"my 3 yr old has been enrolled for little over a month now. started with just a month to see how my daughter took to it, and was enrolled long term by the 3rd or 4th class! even in that short period of time i've seen incredible progress. daughter loves it! staff and all the instructors have been nothing short of top notch! highly recommend!!"
5-star,1,"my daughter has been here 2 years+ and we have nothing but good things to say about the teachers. they are talented and really get involved with all the students. when you deal with teenage girls there are challenges to overcome that transcend the dancing. these instructors realize that. the pricing tends to change as they rearrange the format yearly, but the changes have been all for the better so far as i have seen. the one thing i wish they did is compete, but that doesn't seem to bother my daughter at all, so it's all good. they do perform a sufficient amount, at the state fair, glendale glitters festival, desert ridge, and other places. the recitals are fantastic! there are other schools that do compete, but we are very happy here."
5-star,1,"this is a great gymnastics school for serious gymnasts. my daughter has been going here for a year and a half and she has shown considerable improvement, is getting stronger, building confidence and it's helping improve her coordination. they change the circuits every two weeks so the routines are always fresh. i love the teacher jade, she is my favorite. she challenges the kids and works with their skill level. jade has a great attitude, is very enthusiastic and you can tell she really cares about instilling good form while building the fundamentals of gymnastics in her students. i highly recommend this school for kids 2 years and above!"
5-star,1,"the staff here is amazing. i have two kids in the program. one is in the ninja class with shylar. she is incredible! she has so much energy and excitement for the kids every time we see her! my son loves her! my daughter, who has down syndrome, has emma. she has been unbelievable with my daughter in regards to acceptance, patience and making her (and myself) feel so comfortable. she works with my daughter to make sure she is just like any other child in the class. for anyone with a child with special needs this is such a breath of fresh air! i love this place and their fantastic staff! i would give more stars if i could!"
5-star,1,"this place is fabulous! i am a teacher who works in early childhood, and this is by far the most developmentally appropriate facility for children in sports that i have found. both of my children absolutely love their classes. what an awesome place!"
5-star,1,everyone is so nice and they are really patient. my almost two year old is learning so many great skills. he loves the baby dance class and tumble tots is a blessing when you're trying to teach structure. the open gym is an inexpensive and fun way to beat the heat and it's better than going to the park! i love this place!
5-star,1,"words could never express just how wonderful arizona sunrays is. they have literately changed our kids lives. both of our kids were born with hypotonia and you would never know it. thanks to the amazing staff, spectacular camp and exceptional after school program our children have developed an incredible self awareness, skill set and confidence. coaches kim, jumping jeanie and gm kenzie along with the rest of the coaching staff are very dedicated and it is so apparent."
4-star,1,"i would have given them a 5 star, bit the smell of this place makes me think of a men's lockers room...without ventilation. i am looking for a pile of dirty socks in the corner. everyone who teaches here is awesome and super talented. they have classes for every age."
1-star,0,"very unaccomodating and expensive! if your kids cannot make it to camp one day of the week, they will not allow a makeup day and the price stays the same. they charge a ""late fee"" if you want to come the same day, and don't seem to care whether they turn away new clients or customers because they are more interested in money. gold metal gymnastics in chandler, although a bit further, is a better option. they are friendly, kind, and know that with children and our lives, things don't always work out exactly as we want. save your money and go to another camp that cares about families and kids, and not about nickel and diming you."
5-star,1,"this is an awesome place for summer camp/birthday parties. no need to second guess on that. my son went to the camp last year, as well as currently attending. everyone here has a great positive energy, the kids enjoy a lot as well. they have karate, yoga, swimming, dance and ofcourse gymnastics for the kids."
5-star,1,thank you crew for being an amazingly talented and gifted group of thoughtful and experienced gymnasts. esther loves her gymnastics classes and collectively your organization has assisted in the development of my four year olds' talent for the sport. teacher kim and staff thank you! and thank you for finding a gym in ventura county for us!
5-star,1,"i signed my kids up for the super camp at az sunrays for one week this summer. the kids have had an absolute blast. the instructors greet them warmly when we arrive each morning. i have been thoroughly impressed by their level of organization. the instructors make sure i sign both kids in and out (even when i forget!) the facility is clean. the kids are engaged from the minute they walk in the door. the camp is a little pricey when paying for two kids but well worth it. as much fun as my children had for the week, i will definitely be looking into classes throughout the year. additionally, the level of customer service i have received has been above and beyond. i had an emergency come up while my children were at camp and when i called to let the office folks know i would be a few minutes late (as it turned out, i couldn't get back to pick them up until the end of the afternoon program) they were so kind and accommodating and made my children feel loved and well taken care of until i could get back to collect them. if my kids had to be stranded somewhere this would definitely be their first choice of where to get stuck!"
2-star,0,"is this place still open? their website has been down all week, and no one is returning my messages. we wanted to sign our child up after hearing such good things."
5-star,1,i went to sunrays for close to 6 years and every year was more and more enjoyable! the coaches are top quality and are fun and love to what they do! the facility is as clean as a gym could be and it is a great place for kids to learn both a new sport as well as other skills helpful for coordination and balance.
4-star,1,"my daughters went here for yet another trial class - tumbling and pre-k gymnastics. the facility had a cramped waiting area but free wi-fi (yay!). my daughter's beginning tumbling class were co-ed and had mostly pre-teen/teen girls which my daughter was not normally used to. nevertheless, she had fun being taught and challenged. i did not have a chance to meet her tumbling instructor, but i did meet the pre-k instructor."
5-star,1,just took my 2 yr old daughter this morning for her very first dance class. everyone was super friendly and accommodating (bringing out tap shoes for us to try since it was our first visit) and my daughter had a blast! we're both excited to go back next week. ;)
2-star,0,the employees are extremely nice and helpful; unfortunately this does not make up for the fact that the equipment is outdated and the manager lacks professionalism. i will never return here due to the manager and outdated equipment.
1-star,0,this place really went downhill- won't stop pulling money from my account- they play this round & round bs game of call customer service- go to the gym- if you are considering this place buy a pre-paid plan with them that way you are not forever indebted! if anyone one has a suggestion or information to get the withdrawals to stop i'd be grateful to have it. ( after posting this i was contacted by the facility and the funds are no longer being withdrawn monthly) however the funds they withdrew over the last year were not returned nor was there any interest of repaying me.
1-star,0,it used to be a great gym.... management need to get on it people to clean every day.... restroom smells and is filthy.... it's sad because it was a top notch gym a year ago... what happened
1-star,0,"i've been deciding since my interview if i wanted to write this review. it's been a couple of months and there's no corporate contact information on the website. just location phone numbers. i called in originally asking if they were hiring, the girl on the phone (co manager) yes they have two managers... said they were hiring and we scheduled a interview. she told me to email my resume, and to also fill out an application online. the online application wouldn't work, some type of glitch. she also gave me to the wrong email, i had to call back and ask someone else for the email and he wasn't even entirely sure what it was at first. so i go in for my interview, no one was at the front desk.. (keep in mind i was a supervisor at chuze fitness in tucson for 2 years so i know how a gym should be ran) finally the girl i had an interview comes to the desk, i say my name and that i had an interview. took her a minute, and she finally remembered. first thing she asked me is if i speak spanish. i am a blonde white girl.. (my last name is hernandez, i'm married so she was confused). i stated i was married and that my husband was hispanic and that neither of us knew spanish unfortunately. we sat at her desk (it was a complete mess, she was not prepared) and she introduced me to the other ""co manager"" who was unfriendly. she stated that they both had only been in that position for about 2 weeks. i don't know how either of them got promotions to that position, they would of been fired as a regular employee at the gym i worked at. anyways so most of the interview was talking about how i was ""fully caucasian"" yes she asked me if i was fully caucasian. she also let me know that a guy who works there loves white girls and that he would probably hit on me (super inappropriate). the rest of the interview she read questions off of a sheet of paper and acted completely clueless/incompetent. i literally could of taken over that minute and done a better job than her that's how unprofessional she was. she then said well you were my interview but my other coworker also has some interviews he set up so we'll get back to you and if we don't then you just didn't get the job. so i'm under the impression when i left that they either hired a friend of theirs who will also do a crappy job or i didn't get it because i wasn't in fact hispanic like she originally thought due to my last name being hernandez. super messy, horribly unfriendly staffed gym. not impressed. they clearly had two managers doing the job of one person, kind of like in the show the office where michael and jim are both managers but they really only need one manager. clearly these two kids were both totally incompetent so they had to have two managers to do the job plus a assistant manager. also i was more than qualified for the position, seeing as they needed someone to open the gym from 4 am and be there till 10 am.. i used to do that exact shift 4 times a week as a supervisor at my old job. basically i could have easily done her job, but 10 times better. they need to clean this location up it was awful!"
1-star,0,"do not join this gym!! they will take extra $$money$$ from your account. the blast fitness by our house closed and we did not want to commute to their next nearest gym location. they will not refund the $money$ they continue to debit out of our account. customer service said we had to talk to local gym. the manager their said talk to customer service. after my 3rd go around cs finally said they will not give our money back even though blast closed our home gym with little notice. we have been penalized monetarily, don't get involved with abcfinalcial.com/aka blast fitness. do yourself a favor."
1-star,0,"blast fitness is run by unprofessional and careless employees (even the managers). i showed up to a zumba class one morning and not only was the instructor 20 minutes late to teach her own class but ended up leaving 3 minutes after. she checked to see if anyone was coming into the studio and didn't even take the time to wait for more guests although she had wasted mine and a few ladies time for being late. their classes are not structured and aren't run well at all. my second example includes me being over charged for my membership - when i signed up it was a seventeen year old girl who took care of my boyfriend and i and it was her very first day she mentioned. she had told me upfront is 30 dollars, 20 dollars each month after that and the 49.99 annual fee would be charged in 2017 so i wouldn't have to worry about it this year. well today i noticed the 49.99 charge so i went in to talk to the manager and he stated that promotion hadn't been going on recently so ""it was a miscommunication"". although mine and my boyfriends listening was very clear because i wanted to know exactly what i was getting for this membership. so not only did the employee lie to me upon beginning the membership or was not trained properly in giving direction, i will i not be getting my money back and the assistant manager said i probably heard it wrong.... and it's such a process to cancel the membership. not worth it. and the hours are not correct on the website.. lots of machines are always broken... the water vending machine has been broken for months... the sauna is ridiculously tiny! and bathrooms are dirty"
3-star,0,"despite the fact this gym is not fancy with top of the line equipment and the staff is probably not as attentive as they should be, its great for what i need. and thats a place to work out. i come from a small town where neighborhood gyms were all we had. a couple treadmills free weights amd some machines spread out with a small strip mall building. if you are looking for a place that its going to hound you on rules, where the members are fairly plesant but not overly friendly, and you have the basic equipment you need for a good workout i would definitely come here."
4-star,1,"good gym, good rates, no bs, no sales pitches. some of the other negative reviews mention really specific issues that are rediculous like the staff eating junkfood (apparently the employees have to be on the paleo diet) or that they dont look fit enough and the reviewer would rather pay more to look at better looking trainers (are you kidding me???). bottom line is this isnt a namebrand gym and therefore dont expect la fitness or mountainside or eos when you walk in. 4 stars because the free weights section tends to be a little chaotic with the weights unorganized throughout the day."
2-star,0,"i love the gym and the equipment, but there is one specific problem. the equipment is always broken and they do not enforce any gym edict rules. no one returns the weights to the rack, people stand in front of the weight racks and worst of all everything that is broken never gets fixed. this along with the fact that everyone is on their cell phones and people take up multiple work out stations. what is the point of having staff if no one enforces the rules. this could be such a great place! advice to management tighten up the ship, before there is no ship left!"
1-star,0,"blast fitness is by far the worst gym i've seen. the staff is rude. the locker room and bathrooms stink. it is dam near impossible to cancel your membership. you can't cancel in person, by phone, or by email. the only way is to meet the manager in person, who is never at the gym. they are a bunch of scammers. stay away from this place!!!!!"
1-star,0,"really poor customer service. they don't greet you on your way in or out. looking to switch gyms soon. and another thing, the trainer's act really cocky like a ""bad ass"" and half of them don't even look fit i rather pay more money and get better service. horrible gym"
1-star,0,"i am writing to let you know how frustrated and upset i am with blast fitness. after a couple of weeks of not visiting the gym i finally decided that it would be best to cancel my membership. i went into blast in may to cancel, the gentleman assured me that since the new month period was already underway, i would still be charged for the month of may, but not for june and the rest. after signing some cancellation forms i was told i still had to email blast to let them know i wanted to cancel otherwise i would continue to get billed. i sent an email to blast informing them i wanted to cancel my membership; i did not get a response or anything so i assumed everything was done with. however, it was not until last month that i noticed that i was getting charged monthly by blast even after i had signed cancellation waivers and sent multiple emails. i immediately changed my card to avoid further billings and am now being bombarded with letters from blast demanding i pay them. so today, i again walked into blast to explain my situation. as soon as i explained the situation the gentleman at the counter rudely told me there was nothing he could do because apparently they don't keep any data in their system. (weird, i would at least expect a legitimate business to keep record of all transactions especially within the last year) he told me that there was nothing he could do and suggested i try to contact the company they use for billing? (abc financial) i asked how long that would take because i obviously don't want to get billed for another month. he told me that most of the time up to two weeks and that's if they even open it or even take the time to cancel my membership? i don't understand why people can't cancel at the location they initially signed up at? why do i have to take so many steps, not to mention waste my time and money if nobody is even going to bother to help? all i want is for you to refund my money that i was not even aware i was being billed for because your company doesn't bother attending to their own customers. unless you are sure you want to be a member for life, do not sign up."
1-star,0,"i was told membership was $10 a month, and started getting billed $20.99. don't fall for the gimmick! for $8 more a month go to a clean gym. overall the gym feels very outdated. the ""women's work out room"" is eerie, with 2 random old tv's, purple walls, chipping paint, dusty machines that make noises when you are on them...i would highly recommend going to a lively, inspirational, clean, up to date gym like 24 hour fitness, planet fitness, anything but this."
4-star,1,heard some pretty bad things about this place but it's not that bad. great trainers great classes. could have a bigger sauna but this place ain't too shabby
4-star,1,"better than planet fitness and all of their bs.. they also have zumba, spinning and boot cam classes. the only thing that is not so great are the hours of operation and no pool...but hey for the money i can deal with it."
1-star,0,"loved it because the financial freedom they displayed, but just saw the marketing scheme that now has me member-less and paying to collections... though i am not knee deep in dept with them, still the point is that i no longer felt like a member, but sombody who was a targeted and and quickly marked! i blame myself too for not seeing pasts the sweet promos and pricing, which lead me away from how the really make there money- the fine print as it's whispered to you... i know i know. i know this is the whole strategy and life line of most gyms, but i was surely pitched that of you quit coming it's left at that, period! no contract no worries jus pay per month and your good. when in reality, if you quit, we still charge you per month until you actually fill out paper work claiming that you officially quit and in return when you come to pay your late fees so the don't add up, and you get back in the groove, i get slapped in the face by them saying "" we will not take any payment, you now have to handle that with collections""..... just a heads up on the cancellation process people.. rules are rules and i'm sure there confident to show you where you signed.. like i said, i'm am not knee deep, but i definitely felt the rug pulled from underneath me..."
5-star,1,"i started going to this gym when they first opened up and i currently still love going to this gym! i pay the $21 a month and it includes bring a friend every time and the group x classes us tanning. for the annual price $50 and $21 a month i feel that's a good deal when i can bring one of my friends every time. also this facilty is very clean when looking for a gym i tried out fit zone it had about the same prices and tanning but i always felt dirty and gross in there. the equipment is good, i'm sure if your a really fit male that works out all the time you wouldn't mind if they had a few more things but for me and my boyfriend it works. also all your cardio machines have a tv and mp3 player and a fan. i just recently attended a group x class and i felt it was average but i can still attend different ones. lastly, i find the staff very welcoming, i feel they always acknowledge me and my boyfriend when arriving and always say bye when we are leaving. to me the staff is always friendly and nice! :) the only dislike i have but not enough to give them less stars is i wish the gym was open later on saturdays and sundays! but thanks guys i will continue to be a blast fitness fan :)"
5-star,1,"okay... i was a little harsh with my first review. however... they still need more dumbbells, in smaller weights (i really hate) using the pretty different colored ones because they come from the women's area. i look stupid using bright orange dumbbells, wth? they still need a squat rack, and they need a 2nd leg press (they have a seated leg press as well). i think i'll stay for now ;)"
5-star,1,the owner is doing the right things for the right reasons. building a non-profit from scratch shows his heart is in the right place. absolutely love the community that's grown from this still young and new gym.
5-star,1,"this place is amazing! from the coaches, to the classes and the support received in and outside of the workouts; i feel motivated and driven to keep achieving my fitness goals. if having a good workout with talented coaches is not enough, your membership fee's also allow for them to offer free memberships to our disabled veterans! shout out to coach nick mccombs for providing 1-on-1 training and ensuring i had the proper form before completing any workout."
5-star,1,"an amazing gym for an amazing cause! i started going to branded one crossfit before they even opened their doors. i would meet them at the park on saturdays for their free workout. and trust me when i say that they know how to make someone work. i was at a beginner level, and every workout would leave me sore for days. so sore that you have to fall down, not sit down. as sore as i was, it made me happy to feel that pain because i knew i was getting stronger. it has been so great being able to workout with branded one crossfit since they opened their doors. it is such a nice gym; everything is top of the line, brand new equipment. one of my favorite things about branded one is that warm up we do before a workout. the warm ups are always really fun, like a game or something unique. the workouts are always challenging, and i honestly feel proud after i complete them. but the thing that makes me the most proud is that i am supporting an organization that gives back to the community. on one hand, branded one crossfit is like a normal crossfit gym because it is open to the public and you'll get the same great workout as any other gym. on the other hand, branded one crossfit is so different from other gyms because it is a 501(c)(3) non-profit that gives free memberships to disabled service men and women. even part of one's membership fee is tax deductible. so, that's why i truly love working out there. i am paying the same as i would at any other gym and getting the same type of workout, but i am also giving back just by choosing the right gym to support."
5-star,1,"great coaches, supportive classes and a brand new facility. plus all fees support they're efforts to help injured veterans, can't beat it!"
5-star,1,"i just started at branded one crossfit when it opened july 4th. i had heard concerns that cross fit is too difficult but when i actually came for a workout the owner nick and his other volunteer trainers worked with me to make sure the workout was still difficult but that my form and movements were maximizing my abilities while keeping me safe from injury. since then i have been in workouts with some of the veterans who are receiving a free membership. it feels great to know that my membership supports treatment for veterans and other service members. i highly recommend branded one for cross fit enthusiasts, first timers, and people who just want to get a good work out and help others at the same time!"
5-star,1,brand new facility in a great location! the gym is on the way to and from my work so it makes it easy to get my workouts in. their full sized (handicap accessible) shower makes getting ready for my workday simple after a good morning wod. the coaches are very knowledgeable and great at programming workouts for all skill levels. the community of existing members are very welcoming and make everyone feel like a part of the team . the memberships are affordable and part of my membership goes towards helping local disabled veterans and servicemen and women. feels great to get a tough workout in and know that i'm also helping a good cause.
5-star,1,"this place is great. i've been out of crossfit for over a year and came in this morning for a slow paced wod. these people know what they're doing, it's a smaller box that has a lot of heart. super excited to get back into the groove of things! one thing that appealed to me is their non-profit status, and the work they'll be doing with disabled servicemen (they give them free membership)...which makes you feel like you're contributing to a good cause. i'm excited for their growth and all the cool people i'll get to meet through this box. very unique, this is my new place!"
5-star,1,"i have been to several crossfit gyms and this is the first time i have seen one that exists to only benefit others. the coaches are generous, supportive, and knowledgeable and the members are welcoming - which doesn't always happen. also, part of my membership is tax deductible, which is pretty neat!"
5-star,1,"love this new gym!! not only is this a great place to workout, but they're also a non-profit that helps support/serve disabled servicemen and women! branded one crossfit is welcoming and has great coaches that can modify workouts for every skill level. since it's a non-profit, part of your membership is tax deductible and it's also one of the most affordable crossfit memberships in las vegas. this is a place you definitely need to check out if you're looking for a new place to get fit!!"
5-star,1,"cykl is the best spinning studio in canada for three reasons. first, they make sure that you will not get hurt. they show you how to properly pedal. in contrast, places like soul-cycle try to push you to do exercises that will result in injuries. second, the instructors are super nice and awesome. third, their bikes are unique because you can steer them (working your core and upper arms in a safe way), and the bikes moves a little bit left and right when you pedal, like a real bike! nothing like it in canada. and actually, the other riders are quality people. cykl attracts a very nice community of clients that enjoy each other."
5-star,1,"cykl is a great spin studio. their bikes tilt like a real bike and provide a ride that is closer to a real bike. the benefit is that you use your core and legs. the instructors are super friendly and professional. there is a good variety of classes, my favourites being the endurance classes. highly recommend this studio to those seeking a great cardio workout and zero studio attitude."
5-star,1,"i've tried my fair share of spin places both in montreal and toronto. cykl is a really different but engaging ride. the bikes ""real-ryders"" are these moveable/turnable stationary bikes. the difference in muscle groups is noticeable. there is alot more ab engagement. i bought the 2 week unlimited pass which was priced at $49 plus tax.i went a total of 7 times so depending on your schedule and how many classes you can handle/per week, it can be pretty affordable. the best class i attended was the cykl 30 plus with kim. i am someone who loves to go hard for shorter amounts of time rather than moderate for longer periods of time. the cykl 30 plus was perfect for me. kim is a super enthusiastic and encouraging teacher. i really liked the plus portion which focused more on gluts and abs. overall i would go back in a heartbeat if i lived in the area."
5-star,1,"really liked the class! i echo what the other reviewers have said - the staff is amazing and really makes you feel welcome without being over the top. they help you set up, explain everything, and even brought me a little stool to put my water bottle on (was too big for the cupholder and i couldn't reach from the ground). class was energetic, music was great, instructors are helpful with tips and adjustments. great job cykl!"
5-star,1,"this evening was my first time checking out cykl. i haven't worked out in a while, but i was very excited to get to it. right off the bat, the ladies at the front desk were so welcoming and willing to help. this put me at ease immediately. the change rooms are small, but very well thought out. everything you need is there: lockers, showers, blow dryers and even tampons! these guys thought of everything! when i got to the studio a lovely lady helped me get the bike adjusted and explained the different lingo that would be used during the workout. i was greatful for this as it made it much easier to understand what was going on during the ride. at about the 35 minute mark, i started to feel sick. i overestimated my ""threshold"" of how hard i could push myself :( i got off the bike and told the ladies that i wasn't feeling well. the same woman who helped me figure the bike out told me to drink water and rest. feeling sick actually felt great! i haven't pushed myself that hard in a long time! i looking forward to finding the right pace for me over the next few weeks. overall, this was a wonderful experience. there is no way that it could have been better. thx!"
5-star,1,best place for spinning in downtown toronto! i have tried quite a few other spin gyms in toronto over the year and hands down i get the best workouts here. plus all of the staff are actually helpful and friendly.
5-star,1,"cykl is the best! i have tried 3 other cycling studious downtown and i must say cykl is by far my favourite. the staff is personable and motivating and they do their very best to make you feel comfortable and even appreciated. they have a way of making torturous cardio feel uplifting. and their unique realryder bikes turn lean and turn similarly to a real bike, allowing riders to engage their core. cykl is definitely my go to cycling studio!"
5-star,1,"this spin studio is amazing! the staff are super friendly and helpful, and even followed up with our group after to thank us for coming! they help you adjust your seat to the perfect height for optimal peddling and minimal injury. the bikes are so fun as they move side to side for ""turning"". it's a bit hard to get used to on the first couple of turns, but then is so fun! there are screen which play circuits on bike races, so you feel like you're right there riding in the pack! the music is great, loud, and perfectly timed to the hour workout. the bathrooms are clean, and offer many after shower products for the woman on the run! would definitely go back!"
5-star,1,"this one is a winner. i have never tried spinning before and they were so welcoming. the woman was/is really approachable and down to earth and the instructor was very encouraging and even came down from the instructor bike to help me out. the facility was clean and i like the idea of the bike tilting 30 degrees. that's pretty cool. great music too. i have been dealing with joint pain and was able to finish this class with no issues, listening to my body and following proper technique. so for those of you who are out of shape or even dealing with chronic pain or joint issues, do not be intimidated. give this place a chance."
5-star,1,"i was pretty intimidated by the whole idea of spinning but gave it a try thanks to a friend... this studio has a great positive atmosphere, very friendly staff, is clean (bonus: not smelly!) and plays good music. i've now been going 3-4 times a week for almost two months so i guess i'm hooked! you can book your bike super easily online and they have a whole range of classes to choose from morning/lunch/evening so you can't make any excuses :) highly recommended"
5-star,1,bought a 2-week unlimited pass to cykl after seeing it on blogto and after one visit i am hooked. i was floored by the amazing staff and their willingness to help out and make you comfortable. definitely a huge recommendation!
4-star,1,"cykl has just opened up and i was able to drop in for their free demo week. i've never done a spinning class before, so everything was new for me. the bikes used at cykl are different than others because you can steer it. i found it a bit difficult to steer them and the handles would bounce around a lot when i had to move into a standing position. the instructors were very helpful in getting you set up and making sure that the bike is adjusted to you. the class was pretty intense, but i'm happy i was able to walk the next day! one thing i wish i knew was that you can request a padded seat for your bike. it's really needed."
5-star,1,"i wish yelp would let me give ten stars to one business a year. because i'm pretty sure california cycle path would get those ten stars. yes, it's only january. and yes, i've only been going there since december (a month ago). but i cannot say enough good things about this place. it was recommended to me by a friend. over dinner one night in november with a friend, i had shared that i had decided to make some lifestyle changes that included being more active. i was never a very active person and i'm still slowly getting into better shape. i expressed my interest in finding somewhere to do indoor cycling or swimming during the colder months to keep moving. my friend understood this and explained that at ccp you can pay per class as you go, there's no sign-up fee or monthly membership fee. but more importantly, there's no judgment. i went for my first indoor cycling class early one morning. my friend said larry was a good instructor to start with. he was very welcoming and supportive, told me that if i needed to just sit and pedal, that was fine if i couldn't keep up with what he was doing. that first class really did kick my butt, but larry and the other people in the class were all very encouraging. i knew it would get easier and i had to push myself a little, but i had fun. i've since been to a rowing class with lauren and john, a zumba class with laura and two more spinning classes (one with larry and one with lee ann). all the instructors have their own style but even my second class with larry was completely different (he even mentioned that he could see i was doing better). they have classes early mornings or evenings so it's easy to attend a class before or after work. on weekends they have classes throughout the day. my work schedule varies, but i try to find time to go to a class at least once a week. i've bragged ccp so much that a few of my coworkers are now also hooked. there is even a small lounge area where you can get water, coffee and/or snacks at ccp. oh, and did i mention the peppermint infused cool towels they hand out at the end of a cycling class? if you can't tell, i've been chatting ccp up to anyone who will listen. i only bought a package of 10 classes to start because i wasn't sure if i'd like it or not. boy, was that a mistake. if you're looking to get fit, get more active, or just something different but are hesitant or anxious over the usual gym atmosphere then you need to check out california cycle path."
5-star,1,"i have to share my story with ccp and becoming a dedicated cyclepath!! i weighed 213 pounds, size 16/18 and started with a friend, tammy in february 2016. we started with a trx class and could not even do a plank in the trx straps... while we were laughing at ourselves, an instructor, eddie pavlick, tells us not to worry that this is our baseline... we will be stronger soon! flash forward to december 2016...we are strong! i now weigh 180 and wear a size 12. i am proud of my sculpted arms minus the old lady bat wings... thanks to many trx circuits and sunday morning pound reps. two of the owners, larry crouser and john bratton welcome you to their studio like you are family. although most cyclepaths want to keep this studio ""our little secret"", we all are evangelizing the virtues of california cycle path.. no judgement zone!! a place to workout where you can walk in alone and walk out with ccp workout buds!!"
5-star,1,"exceptional trainers. exceptional experience. this place is home, and all are welcome to come. i spin and take trx several times a week. sundays i take pound, spin, and trx and we call that the sunday triple play. come and try itnfor yourself. let ccp take you to new heights."
5-star,1,"today i went to this studio for the first time, and john was amazing. he was so friendly, warm and an awesome fitness coach. he was super fun and i loved the class. what i also like is that they welcome all levels, and everyone was really comfortable with him. i have already told my girlfriends about this place! i will definitely be back !"
5-star,1,"this is a fantastic studio! wonderful owners and great people working out. i used to workout on my own at home and decided to step up my game, but needed a place that wasn't going to be too anonymous or too pushy. california cycle is perfect for finding that environment. larry and john immediately make you feel welcome and encourage you. i've also had some great classes with lauren, eddie and jessica. i take cycling, trx and pound several times a week and it's pushed me to do better in and out of the gym. update: i just want to clarify that i always hear great things about all the instructors from other cycle paths! i only mentioned instructors here from which i've personally taken classes."
5-star,1,"i am so happy that i found cycle path. i have been to a lot of different workout sites, but i have never looked forward to going back the way i do here. while i choose spin and trx, there are other options for more or less intensity. how great to find a spin class where i feel like i am at my limit, but i don't want to see it end because it is such a great escape--instruction, music, and movement all working together! all that being said, what takes everything over the top is the respect i feel from the owners. just sorry i did not find this place sooner."
5-star,1,i love this place. the instructors make everyone feel confortable. the workouts are scheduled during convenvient hours. most classes are available regularly and occasionally new ones are mixed in. highly recommend!
5-star,1,"tonight was my first spin session here. i loved it! everything from the instructor john, the atmosphere which was very comfortable, music, and newer bikes than i was used to. i think this place will definetly be helping me achieve my goals!! john was so sweet and stayed after class to show my friend and i what trx was all about. thanks again for everything and you will be seeing me soon!"
5-star,1,love this place! the instructors are great and will not make you feel intimated...even if you are new to spin like i was. i highly recommend ccp!
5-star,1,"awww - this is one of my all-time favorite places in pittsburgh!!! as soon as i walked in i felt like i was at home. the spin classes are awesome, i love the trx suspension also. the music is great. the best part is how motivating the two owners are. they are really great, have great taste in music, and are very knowledgeable about form. unfortunately, i have a hip/back injury that prevents me from spinning, but as soon as i can get back to it i'll definitely choose the california cycle path!"
5-star,1,"1 or 15, at california cycle path the number does not matter because you matter. i was the only one able to make it to class this snowy morning. a lesser studio would have canceled class. not ccp. i arrived to a shoveled and salted walk way and after i had my ass thoroughly kicked i was given a cold lavender scented towel to cool back down. this is what it means to really care about clients and how clients become friends."
5-star,1,"i started going to california cycle path with the intention of working out for only a month to cram in as much exercise as i could before i was a bridesmaid. well, that was about 4 months ago, and i'm still an active member! ccp is a great place for a structured workout in a welcoming atmosphere. let's talk about the workouts, then the atmosphere. ccp is not a gym, so you won't be able to come here to stroll on a treadmill or juice your lats and blast your delts like at a gym. the core offerings at ccp are spinning/cycling classes, trx suspension classes, and zumba. other classes such as deskercise, personal conitioning, yolates, and bone building (for those at risk for osteoporosis) are also offered regularly, but not as frequently as the core classes. i've taken cycling, trx, and zumba; and they're all great. cycling is great for an intense calorie burn and cardiovascular conditioning. the music is bumping, and there's a screen behind the instructor showing various cycling paths, or the red bull challenges, or psychedelic shapes that move to the music. there's a wide variety of music played, though i think it would be fun to have themed classes. for example, specific artist (eg., beyonce, britney, or michael jackson) or genre (hip hop, classic rock, edm) class. the trx is awesome for building muscle, improving coordination and athleticism. i think it was invented by some marine guys, so, you know.... zumba is the fun dancing exercise that's good for burning calories and cardiovascular health, coordination, and a bit of muscle building. i leave each of these classes sweating and happy. if you're like me, attending a gym/exercise class for the first few times can be nerve racking. i'm not in crazy good shape, i'm all alone, fitness people can be judgmental sometimes, etc... everyone here is so freaking friendly, though, that after about 10 minutes, i was at ease. here's the thing, i want to describe ccp as a family, because it feels that way. however, i always get a little antsy when i see a business described as a family. you don't always keep the highest standard for your family (that fancy hand soap is for guests!), and it suggests that there's already a formed group to which you do not belong. these worries have not materialized at ccp, though. the owners (john and larry), the other instructors and the other members get to know you quickly, and you feel welcomed and comfortable. there's truly a variety of ages, shapes, races, fitness levels, and genders within the members. cycling classes always end with cold, lavender-scented towels being handed out; the fridge is always filled with water and juice; there's always complimentary snacks and coffee available; the space is always clean; and i can always join or cancel a class through their website or app. california cycling path is a great addition to the north shore/brighton heights area, and if you're looking for a different type of workout, give it a try!"
5-star,1,"loved it here! the instructors are knowledgable, enthusiastic, and truly care about their clients. the spin class was fun and entertaining and i was drenched in sweat at the end. the studio itself is adorable and unique, unlike the standard modern studios that have no personality. i'll be back for sure!"
5-star,1,"california cycle path is hands down the best fitness studio in pittsburgh. passionate trainers, and great classes. a great place for beginners too"
5-star,1,"obsessed with ccp. i'm a runner and was looking for a place to take some cross-training classes without paying an expensive membership fee. first class is free (!!!) and when we told them we lived close they gave us an amazing discount. great classes and instructors that are so welcoming and do a great job of incorporating all skill levels into classes. love the cycling so far, can't wait to try other types!"
5-star,1,"early this year california cycle path added trx, zumba, and bokwa classes. i think i should probably just set up a cot in the back. i am at ccp nearly every single day. the instructors are all incredibly motivating, friendly, and knowledgable. i have taken fitness classes and been a member of several other gyms, and none of them come close to comparing to the atmosphere of ccp. they have established one of the most welcoming, supportive fitness communities imaginable. from the beginner to the expert, there is most definitely a place for you here. no one should feel uncomfortable walking through the doors here whether they are trying to lose weight, tone up, or just maintain an active lifestyle. you will always be met with a smile, a towel, and the encouragement you need to reach your goals (from the instructors and members!). thank you to john, larry, and the whole ccp gang for changing my life for the better!"
5-star,1,"if you are trying to challenge yourself, learn some technique and surround yourself with awesome people this is the perfect spot, i been training with cbcf for almost a year and its been and incredible experience."
5-star,1,"by far the best crossfit gym in the whole phoenix metropolitan area. i drive at least 30 minutes every day to come do classes with coach rob, matt, and jake. this is easily the nicest facility i have ever been to. there is nothing better than getting in shape surrounded by coaches and fellow members that hold you accountable and support you every single day."
5-star,1,"great community, upbeat, & funny; very positive. after a good, long warmup, matt rhodes coached a wod in my wife's wheelhouse but kicked my butt. would definitely go back. a large area with many rigs necessary for the group size."
5-star,1,"if i lived here this would be my home box without a doubt. the coaches are amazing, matt, rob and jake are great people. everyone here was super cool and i looked forward to coming in and leaving it on all on the floor. i can't say enough good things about this box and i can't wait till i get to come back!"
5-star,1,i'm super new to crossfit and was so nervous to go to a box but rob and matt are both super supportive and amazing. i love the energy here. i was worried i would be waves behind everyone but there are all different levels and abilities here and the general atmosphere is extremely positive. i know it's a workout but it's my favorite part of the day. i highly recommend camelback crossfit.
5-star,1,"i have a love hate relationship with this place. i hate getting up early and going, but i love how i feel after my workout! crossfit has worked much better for me because it is quick and it mixes mixes up the moves to keep things fresh. way better than the standard gym."
5-star,1,"i'm so glad i signed up for this gym, i visited a few gyms before finding this one and i am so happy i found it! all the trainers are extremely nice and helpful, i've never done crossfit until now and i feel like i found the best gym to learn in,"
5-star,1,"it's been almost 2 years and still, everyday. .. matt, rob, dom (coaches) always, without fail, greet you with a smile. this place continues to inspire me to work hard and show up. how could you not enjoy coming to the gym when every single workout is difficult bit you're getting cheered on by your coaches and classmates? it's just great. and the coaching is constant with little tips to keep your form on cue. they've added a smoothie bar which offers delicious drinks. i'm still so happy i found this on my first foray into the crossfit community."
5-star,1,"camelback crossfit is a fantastic box full of fantastic people. i'm new to crossfit and from the very first day i felt welcomed and supported by everyone. in the past i have always needed to have a personal trainer in order to force myself to get into the gym. since i started at camelback, i am actually motivated each day to get to the box and workout. i'm fortunate to have found this place."
5-star,1,"there are a lot of great things to say about camelback crossfit, great coaches, family atmosphere, very clean, great equipment, free tampons a plus in my book. but the coaches make a difference, they take the time to help you out with form and technique and encourage you thought the workout. everyone is great."
5-star,1,"coach rob's favorite music is country. ...this alone deserves 5 stars. but in all seriousness, i'm no true crossfitrer, but cbcf is the perfect crossfit gym to supplement my normal bodybuilding-style lifting with. haven't been in very consistently due to jacking my back up (unrelated to their gym), but i always enjoy the challenge these guys put forward with their workouts when i do make it in."
5-star,1,"as good as it gets is right. camelback crossfit has it all: the coaches, the community, the equipment, the location, and the price. i've been crossfitting for 5 years, and cbcf is among the top boxes i've ever been to. their attention to individual athlete needs, and their ability to scale and push you to work on your weaknesses is bar none. the community is a great group of diverse people who will laugh with you and not judge you, whether you are a beginner or at the elite level. if you're in the south scottsdale area, this is the gym for you. can't recommend enough."
5-star,1,excellent facility. outstanding coaches. if you want a gym that motivates you to get in the best shape you have ever been in then go and take one of coach matts classes. a+ and 5 stars.
5-star,1,"if you want to become stronger, more mobile and an overall better athlete you have to come to camelback crossfit! the coaches are amazing, always willing to help you better yourself and the atmosphere is great. awesome sense of community. as an exercise physiologist myself, i recommend this gym to everyone."
5-star,1,"having been a crossfit athlete for almost three years now, i have had the opportunity to visit multiple gyms, but let me fill you in on a little information about camelback. joining just over a month or so ago, i have not only seen tremendous improvements in my overall performance, but i have never been pushed harder than when i train at camelback. all of the coaches take time to get to know each athlete individually and more importantly they work with each athlete to understand exactly where they are in performance abilities. when needed, the coaches will work one on one with athletes to ensure proper form and make sure each athlete knows that their overall well being is a priority of the coaches. the overall atmosphere of this gym is welcoming and is truly like one big family. i was taken into the family with arms wide open and each individual that trains here is unique in their own way. this gym offers something for everyone; from beginner to skilled athlete. without a doubt, you will be pushed to the limits."
5-star,1,"you can't go wrong choosing camelback crossfit. the workouts are well planned, the coaches are knowledgable and friendly, and the people who you meet here become your family. cost-wise it's also one of the most affordable crossfit gyms in the valley! i love working out here and would recommend it to any of my friends looking to get fit."
5-star,1,been coming to camelback crossfit for the past 2 months now and it has been a fun and welcoming experience. the workouts are well planned out and challenging. the coaches are great and really encourage you in the right way. i really like how they advise me to use a safe amount of weight. they really want you to have a safe workout and dont pressure you to be lifting crazy amounts of weight overnight! the group that works out at this gym are the best! everyone is super nice and really encouraging. crossfit can be very intimidating and i felt welcome right away!
5-star,1,"let's see where to start... i original joined this gym (box) in january 2014 when it was known as scottsdale health care (shc). so, i too was recently on yelp, looking for the perfect fit. as such, i was skeptical of a lot of reviews because of biases or a person's one bad experience. with that said i would like to add my review to help you. i must warn you though... i'm obsessed with camelback crossfit (cbcf); it's like a 2nd home, and i have no intentions of vacating anytime in the near future. i'm going to squat here until i die! the review is most definitely going to be a little biased. i mean what would you expect? that was a rhetorical question. i will however try my best to be as neutral as possible, or a voice of reason so to speak. atmosphere: now you have to understand, at the end of the day, i am an introvert. during the rest of the day it just depends on whether or not i made it to cbcf, or if i am hangry, or sleep deprived, the vibes (yep! said it) around me, and/or alcohol :p. this makes interacting with new people in an unknown territory a lot of work! i will also state the fact that i did try out a couple other crossfit gyms, of which, i had friends at, until i found cbcf. justly so, the atmosphere makes this place, like so many have said before. i was content with getting in, doing the work out and leaving. now i get there early, shoot the shit during, and hate leaving after. i've never had that feeling at any other gym in my life! it's just something you have to come and feel for yourself. feel them vibes! wod (work out of the day): a different hour long adventure every day! very rare to do something twice in a month, except for weightlifting, but they differ in set and reps each week. here's honest for you... it won't be easy at first, crossfits a whole different workout, but you'll make it through and be damn proud of it! they've also recently added new classes such as crossfit 101 & 102, olympic lifting, and running endurance & mobility. there's whisper of a yoga class being added too! people: do you know how hard it is to be cordial at 5 in the morning? would you believe me if i told you i was warmly welcomed at 5am? do i need to expand more on the people/community of this place? how often have you competed against friends who are cheering for you before, during, and after? people who challenge you to get one more rep? or add 5 more pounds on the bar? who want to see you grow into the person you dream of being physically and mentally? and as the days and months go on i continue to become friends with more and more old and new members alike here. coaches: i have had the privilege of being trained by matt, dom, and rob, but will not forget to mention brady. all of whom are constantly improving everyone's form on lifts and movements alike, as well as motivating people to their next plateaus. they truly know what they are talking about and rightfully so given the title coach. remember that atmosphere i was talking about? the coaches here are the driving factor behind it and have earned respect, not asked for it. you won't come into this place and be forgotten about! price: can't beat it! at least for a crossfit membership. yes, i do know, i count shit for a living, and it was a big factor when i initially chose cbcf. $115 for an individual. discounted to $100 for military (thank you btw) and students. $200 for 2 family members. why i chose camelback crossfit: see above"
5-star,1,love this gym. used to be at a box in chandler and these guys do it better for less cost. great location and awesome facility. they have me excited to work out again. would recommend to anyone looking to find an affordable crossfit in scottsdale or just trying to get involved with xfit. beginner classes are very friendly and informative. been crossfitting for a year and and am learning new things here every day. best gym in the area.
5-star,1,"do yourself a favor and hit up this gym! the coaches, workouts and overall community are the best in the city. you'll thank me later!"
5-star,1,"i love this community!! when i started 4 years ago i was out of shape and overweight(no one told me this at the time!). today, with the help of all the great coaches, i feel like the sky is the limit! if you're looking for a change form the same ol' boring gym workout, there is no better place than camelback crossfit!"
5-star,1,"camelback crossfit is a world class functional fitness gym located in south scottsdale, or sosco, if you're that guy. it's safe to say that these gyms all have the same stuff in them, but cbcf has one thing, that no other gym does- coach matt. coach matt is a tremendous fitness expert who provides quality instruction and training to all the members of the gym. coach matt is super encouraging, positive, and highly knowledgeable in all things fitness. in addition to knowing his stuff, coach matt also fosters a positive environment throughout the entire gym, so that none of the typical gym douchiness or cliques are a factor. all the other athletes at cbcf are very helpful and encouraging. cbcf has competitive athletes, regular people, newbies, and people like me who are clueless. regardless of what group you align with, you will find a comfortable fit at cbcf! everyone is welcome, and the veterans there are super helpful and supportive. i can not recommend this gym highly enough. if you're ready to change your life- stop your search and get started. coach matt and cbcf can help you reach all your fitness goals. if you are ready for an amazing experience, where you will work hard, and reap the benefits, then check it out. why not you?"
5-star,1,this is an amazing gym! i had never done jiu jitsu and after 6 months practicing here i am addicted. the instructors are wonderful!.i love watching the kids class because they all look like they are having so much fun. and as for myself i am 42. all ages welcome!! everyone at this gym is so inviting. you will feel right at home.
5-star,1,"i had a really nice visit here, everyone was very nice and they had a lot of very accomplished jiujitsu fighters on the mat. the team camaraderie was excellent, even the parents were very involved and welcoming. i had the opportunity to see the professor when gold at nationals, and it was awesome to see the whole gym there cheering him on and taking big group pics together. if you are looking for a happy jiujitsu home i'd recommend this gym to anyone."
5-star,1,great place to train in henderson. clean gym with a family feel. very knowledgeable instructors and awesome kids program!
5-star,1,"i have trained many styles of martial arts and i have attended several schools. i have to say that carlson gracie henderson has been the most enjoyable and informative by far. the master, romulo caiado, is at every class. no excuses. we have instruction every day. he is on the mat helping all levels. if you're a beginner, he helps you understand and practice the move. if you're a higher level belt, he really focuses on your technique. in a short period of time, the team has developed a brotherhood and it's always a positive feeling at school. i recommend this school to all levels. come by and try a class and you will see there is truth to this post."
5-star,1,"my family has been training with the carlson gracie team for 3 years now and in large part under romulo's and bryan's tutelage. their jiu jitsu instruction is high level and they have a good way of teaching it to adults and kids alike. their dedication to the gentle art is unparalleled, showing up for all classes and all tournaments to teach, coach, mentor. so their track record of consistency is proven and makes it easy for my family to continue our training with them at their new gym: carlson gracie henderson. the gym atmosphere is very up-to-date and clean, and i've seen the mats being cleaned multiple times a day to ensure all students safety. two clean bathrooms and two changing rooms with plenty of space for your gear. there's also a huge seating area for parents to watch their kids at close proximity so they can see how quickly they progress. teammates and training partners are all beasts and will smash on every roll, but in a good way because they will also help correct mistakes right after, improving upon each other's techniques. egos are checked at the door and the mantra here is ""not about being better than anyone but being better than you were yesterday."" the class structure is a simple warmup, then straight to jiu jitsu specific drills so that students time isn't wasted doing calisthenics they can do at home. the jiu jitsu specific drills will leave you ""dying"" and thinking ""i'm good for the day"", yet you push yourself because you know it will pay dividends in your bjj game. after the jiu jitsu drills and movements is the technique part of the class. a technique is demonstrated, then some variations of that technique along with various entry ways to get into that position to be able to execute the technique. this is drilled week long, along with defenses and counters. the instructors ensure partners are adequately switched around for all students to ensure enough repetitions, and also varying body types and what works for various body types and what adjustments need to be made for others. after the technique portion of the class come the live rolls, where you get to roll with partners of all skill levels from white belt all the way up to black belt. there's plenty of time to get in enough rolls to have you limping into and out of your car post training after a good hard workout. the kids classes are run in the same fashion, ensuring kids get plenty of jiujitsu specific movement/cardio, and repetitions for the drills and techniques, and building endurance and confidence up along the way. romulo and bryan are very mindful of mistakes made during live rolls and will correct them quickly. they also roll with the kids in a way that allows the kids to work on their base and balance, to try the technique and to learn what works and what doesn't as they put their training to the test. they will also incorporate games at the end of kids class that encourage jiujitsu movements while also making it fun for the kids, which helps keeps the kids engaged for the long haul. this place is a true team where strong bonds are forged through tough training and battles on the mats and in competition. you can expect blood, sweat, and tears here, but all in a good and positive way. wins and losses are shared as a team, as all teammates help each other get better everyday. if you're looking for top quality jiu jitsu from genuine human beings, without all the gym politics of where else you can and can't train, this is a great place to start your training, supplement your existing training, or to continue your martial arts journey. oss..."
5-star,1,"honestly, i don't write much reviews but i have to give props to charlotte rips in the area. when i first came here, i was hesitant to start due to being out of shape. i hadn't worked out in over 2 years, i ate pizza for breakfast and worked at an office job.... being mobile really wasn't my thing. after getting a physical where my blood pressure and cholesterol put me at risk for some health issues, i decided to make a change. i didn't know where to start but i decided to try charlotte rips. right away, vito was very knowledgable and helped me feel comfortable by walking me through the process of what to expect and what was expected of me to see results. i've never been a gym rat but this is a place that i truly enjoy. it's only been about a month but already my overall health has improved and i'm starting to see results. if you want to be in a workout environment that strives to empower you to work towards your goals whatever they may be, as well as start your journey towards a healthier lifestyle then i would recommend this place. don't be fooled though, you have to put in the work. my trainer is andre and he always provides one on one specialized training to work towards my goals. all of the trainers are dedicated towards helping their clients become better and they help you learn how to eat better and adopt fitness as a lifestyle.this place is affordable and for the level of service provided, i highly recommend."
5-star,1,i have been working out with charlotte rips for almost two years now- and i can't get enough!! the facilities are great but the knowledge and support of all the trainers are even better! i am so thankful for this team and what they've done for me and the fitness goals i've achieved.
5-star,1,"march 19,2014 i sat down with vito to do my fitness assessment/consultation weighing 193 lbs, needing to purchase size 14/16s & xls, & completely out of shape. april 2014 i started my journey not able to complete a push up but wanting to lose weight, get in shape, and be able to look ""good"" wearing a bikini. as a cancer survivor i truly just wanted to be healthy! from april 2014-present (yep, i'm still a faithful client with new fitness goals) i have watched my body transform! i'm still in shock by with my new body. i have lost over 30 lbs, inches, body fat %, & insecurities while gaining muscle, a new love for my ""physically"" fit body, education on the proper nutrition and fitness, that it will take to maintain my results, and an addiction to a fit lifestyle. in august i was able to purchase 5 bikinis to celebrate my 35th birthday & show off my new body in jamaica! replaced my entire wardrobe with my new size sm/med and 4/6s! in september 2015, updated my goals to body building! i never expected anything less because i knew i was training with the best!"
5-star,1,i have been working out with zack scott for almost 2 months. i love the results i am seeing. thank you for keeping me on track. zack you are the best!
5-star,1,"zack scott is my trainer and i almost didn't want to write a review because everyone will want to train with him and leave no space for me! kidding of course, but he is great. when i see him, it is for 30 minutes twice a week and sometimes more depending on my schedule. he even made up a meal plan for me. i was training to go overseas and play lacrosse this past spring and he made me feel very in shape and ready to play. he is attentive and very cautious to what you would like to work on. i am personally not trying to become super muscular but i want to be in shape and healthy. he makes sure to work on specifics based on what i tell him i would like to do while also explaining why we do certain workouts in order to reach the goal i would like."
5-star,1,i've been training with zack for about 10 months & the results i've achieved have been nothing short of amazing! they provide an initial assessment which allows you to express your concerns (in my case to be toned but not bulky). zack has helped me take my results to the next level & allow this mommy to wear a bikini again!
3-star,0,"i tried mansfield yesterday after getting a 5 day guest pass. the service is great, the gym is huge. for me it's a a bit too inconvenient to work out there regularly since i don't live or work downtown, however for those who do it's a really good option. there's lots of machines for both cardio and weight training. i don't particularly like the fact that it's a 6 level gym.....primarily since it's a converted theater so you have the different layers of the balcony sections and the main level and the stage. access to the different levels and areas is also a bit restricted and and you really have to know where to go. there's a studio on the 3rd floor that is accessible only by a small elevator which is a bit odd. the studio has only 1 punching bag....1, which seems ridiculous for a facility the size of mansfield. locker rooms are quite large as well, lots of towels, a sitting area with tv to relax, steam room, sauna, coat room, etc. pricing seems very reasonable for a nice gym smack in the middle of downtown, it's not cheap but i thought it would be more. the size of the facility is a bit overwhelming and it wasn't very busy for such a huge space, but overall a good downtown workout option and there's a restaurant on site that closes really early (also very odd)."
1-star,0,"this place is either the best example of how to launder money or the worst example of how to run a business. here is the executive summary: the good: the equipment (at least until recently) the equipments are top of the line brand names, at least until recently, when they started to remove them for trendy apparatus that no one uses, but would make the manager the highest amount of commission. the bad: well where to start? the locker rooms are filthy and a contagious disease waiting to happen, this is more evident specially during the weekends. and this is not due to lack of staff. in this place even the assistants have assistants. but no one seems to work in this place no matter which department. whether its custodial, cleaning or accounting. most likely because this place changes more manager than banana republics change presidents and none of them seem to have any business or managerial training. there are seldom a trainer on duty during the weekends as it should be. whatever you do, do not give them your cc number! they would charge you for anything and everything that they think of. of course they would reverse the charges when you confront them but at the cost of your precious time and sanity. the trainers are there for one reason and one reason only to push expensive training sessions on clients. it's a shame because the gym used to be very good one, but it has gone down year after year. i used to be a member for 5 years but could not take it anymore. do yourself a favor and check out other gyms in the area they are all better whether its quality wise or price wise!"
1-star,0,the absolute worst gym in montreal. staff walks around and think they are king shit on minimum wage. horrible energy and place. you just want to leave the moment you walk in. so you charge higher prices and that makes you better? idiots at large in here.
1-star,0,"beware! my locker was broken into at 6pm on a weekday, yet nobody saw or reported anything. i've been going to gyms around the world for 30 years and this is the first time somebody took a large lock cutter (i had a solid masterlock in place) and stole my expensive watch, bracelet and iphone. management was sympathetic but wasn't willing to put up a sign (""anybody see or hear anything suspicious..."") and told me i should have left valuables in the small lockers at the entrance. furthermore, i was told this happens from time to time and i should have known better...well never happened to me in toronto, nyc, vancouver, london, tokyo. there was a video of someone going into and out of the locker suspiciously while i was working out, but they weren't willing to challenge him and try to recover my valuables. they let me cancel my membership, but i still feel violated and hate montreal and its dishonesty. i think of it every day... wonder if it was an inside job?"
5-star,1,"amazing gym. good equipment, high ceiling and friendly staff. haven't been to any classes yet but i heard good feedback."
1-star,0,sent me to collections for 600$ for not continuing with my membership. if you sign for a year you're pretty much stuck with it..only ever went 5 times
5-star,1,"i have been a member at mansfield for 4 years. there are 3 locations. downtown, west island and brossard. it is expensive however the gym is everything you could hope for minus a pool. the staff and trainers are always very pleasant to deal with."
1-star,0,after confirmed via phone that they accept crossfit drop ins they refused to sign me up since i couldn't tell them the name of the person i spoke to. they value their bonus more than letting you actually work out....
1-star,0,"people with money generally have it because they do not waste it. $130+ a month (for 1-year signup factoring in initiation fee) for a membership at this place is laughable. yes, that's right, $130+/mo for a gym membership. there is absolutely nothing at this facility that would make me contemplate that type of membership cost. they are not even open 24 hours. they are not even open before 6am? don't you think people with the means to consider paying your ridiculous membership rates have busy careers and would need flexible gym hours?? the whole membership age-related scale is also extremely offensive. under 30 you pay one price, 30-34 another, over 35+ yet another price.in my opinion this amounts to age discrimination. but i could put up with all of that if i actually thought it was worth it, but for this price no sane person would cough up $130+/mo for a pretty looking gym when there are comparable options in the area."
5-star,1,"oh juste wouahou!!!!! quel luxe! quelle place! quelle service! tout est mis en place pour qu'on s'y sente bien et que l'on n'ait aucun inconvénient! plusieurs choix de machines de cardio ou de musculation, un très grands espaces (il s'agit d'un ancien théâtre), un bistrot pour se rassassier avant ou après sa séance de sport (peut-être plutôt après), des pommes proposés à la réception pour donner un petit coup de fouet pour aller se défouler sur les machines, une plage horaire remplie de cours de fitness, yoga, spinning... des vestiaires très propres, des piles de serviettes de bain mises à disposition, des sèches-cheveux et des lisseurs accessibles à tout le monde, sauna et jaccuzi inclus, de grands casiers pour y mettre aisément ses affaires... tout est mis en place pour rendre la séance de sport agréable! le slogan de ce gym que je proposerais serait:""quand faire du sport est un plaisir""!"
5-star,1,"w-o-w, i am somewhat surprised and very confused about these two reviews below! i'm sad that jim j. came across such an awful employee. i understand these two men completely, but so far my experience has been totally different. here is my experience, i walked in for the first time and i was greeted i suppose nicely since i don't remember anything out of the ordinary... i asked the reception if i could have a tour or look around and the head trainer happened to be near me. he grabbed me and eagerly said sure. so after we chatted and looked at the training areas, he explained to me that i had to make an appointment with the sales guy and i did conveniently for the following day. the appointment with the sales guy was shorter then usual b/c i had already seen most of the facility the day before. i enjoyed talking with him, at first it was like a lifestyle interview and i told him why i was there. i was very impressed with the whole place. the women's dressing room is not smelly. there are fresheners everywhere. the showers, when i am there, are very clean. there's not even hair caught in the drain, which is something i can barely tolerate. 98% of the time i get the exact cardio machine i want. there are tv's with cable connected to most of the machines, requiring you to just plug in your earphones and you can watch tv while you workout. my one irk :: these tv's do not always work and this is annoying. i am there 4 times a week for about 1.5 hours each visit. it is very expensive, i pay a permanent $86 and some cents / month for my membership - my rate will never go up. however, your towels - they provide them and there are always plenty. there is not one, but two hot sauna rooms available in the shower area. of cosmetic items they provide (and is included in the membership per month): - q-tips, cotton balls; - body & hand cream; - hair gel & spray; - at least 8 hair-dryers (there is usually always one available for me to use when i need it after a shower); - shaving cream (& disposable razors, by request); - shampoo & conditioner (in the shower stalls); so in the end i thought it was worth it although i haven't needed to cancel anything yet. ;-)"
1-star,0,"bravo b**ch at frontdesk with sh*** attitude!! thanks to you, mansfield has lost one (or perhaps just another) potential client. i was just there to quickly take another look at this place as i had to take a decision between there and another gym. well she made my decision unbelievably easy and i thank her for that. in an amazing demonstration of rudeness and attitude, that girl at front desk on november 11 at about 2:30pm had me literally running to maa where i signed in on the spot. i quote ""this is a private club, we don't let people walk around""...she said i had to sit down again with a sales rep and go thru the same questionnaire-filling bs. all this with her mouth full of the lunch she was eating right at front desk... oh ok, so that's how you handle your prospective clients?i don't even wanna start imagining how you treat actual clients, lmfao! i guess i was lucky it was made so blatant for me to see..i actually feel for those getting ripped off day in and day out. besides...a weight room without even a basic pulley system, smelly locker rooms, charging $90/mth plus fees? kidding right?"
5-star,1,"we have 3 boys ages 3,6,9 all in the program. what a difference 6 months has made. we love that they first drill and then are able to spar and practice in a real situation what they just learned. we love the student to instructor ratio. there are many instructors to teach and to watch and correct the kids form. our 3 year old is getting a solid foundational skills that will help him when he advances to the older kids class."
5-star,1,"great place to train in las vegas. the mat space is very large with mats covering the walls. it is also very well maintained, since i've been training here i have yet to hear of someone getting staph or ring worm. also note, what seems like the front door is really the back door. the front door is on the other side of the building. that got me when i first entered the gym. the training and instruction is top notch here. professor hector is a very knowledgeable black belt under cobrinha. he focuses on all his student on and off the mat, as well as helping visitors learn the techniques. he encourages students to ask questions on the technique of the day or just any technique the student has in mind. another cool thing about this gym is that a lot of famous jiu jitsu practitioners come here to visit. just to name a few cobrinha (obviously), miyao, denilson pimenta, bruno malfacine. the jiu jitsu itself is amazing. this was not the gym i started my jiu jitsu journey, but how my game has evolved since i started training here is baffling. come here and roll to see for yourself!"
5-star,1,"my two sons and i started with cobrinha in july (2017). since the start, i've been impressed by the skill and caliber of the students and instructors. it's unquestionably among the best i've seen. in the first few weeks i saw improvements in my sons' and i, and we have been building on that regularly. my sons have competed in tournaments and have grown through those experiences, thanks to cobrinha. not only is it a great school to improve your bjj it's an academy with great families who are welcoming and kind. all of the the coaches/instructors are top notch and caring. for example, coach robert for the 7 am class is experienced and passionate. coach ryan in the kids class is always encouraging my sons and giving guidance on improvements. i am regularly impressed by professor hector (owner). he challenges the students to become the best version of ourselves both mentally and physically; he takes opportunities to challenge students to become better people in their everyday lives. if you're goal is to learn a self defense, healthy living, improve your bjj, or even compete in bjj, cobrinha las vegas is the academy for you."
5-star,1,"we brought our daughter to cobrinha from another bjj academy here in vegas because we kept hearing the whispers that the kids program was second to none...and were blown away. we signed up the same day. hector vasquez personally teaches the classes and is on the mat with the kids the entire class (along with a minimum of 5 other instructors). the instruction and training is unmatched. safety is always a top priority and every child is very closely monitored. it is very fitting that his slogan is ""evolve your game"" because that's exactly what happens when you train here!! our daughter has not only grown leaps and bounds technically, but her self confidence has skyrocketed! i think what makes all the difference is professor vasquez's passion for what he does. he cares so deeply about every one of his students. we are so glad we found this place!"
5-star,1,"visiting from mn, i was made to feel like family the second i walked in. great family oritented atmosphere, but their bjj is all business. no ego, no arrogance, and hector learned from a living legend, cobrinha himself. go here, visitor or resident of lv. you won't regret it."
5-star,1,"the best jiu jitsu academy in las vegas! i stopped by here while in vegas for a few days. hector is a thorough and precise instructor and it shows in the success of his students. the environment of the academy is awesome, everyone is friendly and the training is second to none. whether you live in or near vegas, or are visiting and looking to cross train; this academy should be your first stop."
5-star,1,"i cannot say enough great things about this place and professor hector. i've been around for over a year now and finally got around to writing a long-overdue review. it's worth a read for anyone who wants to learn more about this academy. below i thoroughly highlight areas worth discussing about the academy. kids program professor hector is amazing with the kids, and it shows with the continuous growth in enrollment. parents rely on him to ensure their child(ren) learn not only the sport, but discipline and hard work. his kids class put in serious work. it's crazy to see how he seamlessly manages 40+/- kids on the mat. he knows just how to handle the kids, regardless of their personalities and ages. just watch a class, and you will see how much the kids respect professor and the assistant coaches. bjj all levels this is the class with mostly adults and some kids/teens. what's interesting is seeing the growth in parents who are now taking part in their children's lifestyle. couples, too, are joining together. it doesn't matter what belt color or fitness level you're at, professor will make it work for you. community it's a family environment, which means anyone is welcome. even if you don't practice bjj and have a family member or partner that does it, you'd still be drawn in. professor hector for someone who sees about 50-100+ people daily, he knows every single member's name, and to me that says a lot about how sincere and passionate he is. he's not just there to do a job. he gets to know you and your weaknesses and strengths and helps you to develop an efficient way of training. during technique drills, he goes around the class and really pays attention to details and will ensure you have the proper form. as a white belt, i think that's important and he helps explain the mechanics/use of the move. of significance to me is how accommodating he is -- when i was pregnant, he provided a safe training environment that enabled me to train up until i gave birth. because i continued to train, i was able to stay flexible and thus had an easy birth. i came back, over a month later, and he continues to encourage and challenge me to get back to a more consistent/hard training. in addition to teaching, professor also makes it a point to impart some words of wisdom or inspiration at the end of class sometimes. it serves to motivate us lest we become complacent. that's the kind of mentor/coach you want; not someone who easily dismisses the class after teaching. he cares--a lot. many people look to a leader who's obviously good at what they teach. so whether it's scholastics or sports, we all want to learn from champions, professionals, and highly decorated athletes. there's a difference between being the best at something and being able to teach it. so, one thing to keep is mind is -- ""but how well can they teach?"" professor hector exemplifies both the expertise in the sport and in teaching it. so whether you're serious about bjj or simply want to learn and be part of the community, this is the place to be."
5-star,1,"came to las vegas and decided to train at cobrinha brazilian jiu jitsu while i was in town. professor hector is welcoming, friendly, and an outstanding instructor. the other students were friendly and helpful on the mat. no egos and you can sense the passion everyone has for jiu jitsu. the academy is also very clean. i highly recommend cobrinha brazilian jiu jitsu."
5-star,1,"very competitive, a lot of skilled kids to help yours grow. my daughter is 10 with a gray belt and in her group she goes against mostly gray belts and yellow belts which helps her develop skills. coaches are always there watching and giving feedback. the kids are constantly learning new moves. hector is amazing with the kids and motivates them. the gym itself is full of trophies from the kids tournaments. i can go on and on. basically i've been here for 2.5 months now and my daughter has learned more during this time than in 1.5 years at a gym down the street. i pay more here, yes. but it's all worth it. i can safely say that every penny spent at this other gym was money in the garbage. here no, i am very willing to pay more because i get what i pay for, and more!"
5-star,1,"when we came to cobrinha my son had been practicing bjj for 4 months. we were very unhappy with his previous gym so with a recommendation from a friend we reluctantly tried cobrinha bjj. however, the moment we stepped into the gym we were warmly greeted by professor hector and his staff. he explained to us his philosophies and gave us a brief background of his bjj education and accomplishments. following our meeting my son participated in a trial class and it soon became apparent that his first 4 months of training was a joke. in the first day at cobrinha, he learned techniques and verbiage that he had never learned previously. professor, the other coaches and the kids were very patient and willing to help him throughout the session. i couldn't believe the amount of unity and willingness to help that everyone has. after leaving we knew that this was the place that we need our son to train. it has been 7 months now and my son has participated in 3 tournaments and has won all 3 (including pan kids 2017). his growth and accomplishments are all because cobrinha bjj has given him the tools he needs to be an amazing fighter and person. because at cobrinha, professor's philosophies of bjj are not only applicable on the mat but off as well. we are a true family at cobrinha bjj. so if you want your child to grow as a fighter and really grasp the concept of bjj come to cobrinha. you will not regret it, we don't! cobrinha bjj!!!"
5-star,1,professor hector was very welcoming and instantly made my kids feel comfortable and like part of the group! great atmosphere and family environment! glad i brought my kids here
5-star,1,"i had started training jiu jitsu in 2011, but i eventually stopped going 1. because of my work schedule and 2. because the school i was at focused most of their attention on the higher belts and getting them ready for their next competition and not so much on the beginners. i felt like every time i went to class, i was pretty much just a sparring dummy for the higher belts, who weren't interested in teaching me and just interested in smashing me and submitting me. when i decided to look for a school recently to get back into jiu jitsu, and also for my girlfriend to join, i actually went back to my old school to observe a class... and it was still the same. higher belts on one side of the room and the beginners left to themselves on the other side of the room. another big thing was the lead instructor was not present... that same night, i went to observe a class at cobrinha. the first person i met was hector vasquez. he asked me right then and there if i wanted to put on a gi and participate in the class. i said i would like to just watch for now. the class starts off with hector teaching the whole class a move/technique, and the class pairs up and drills the move. this is the warmup. no carrying your partner on your back across the room and back, forward rolling across the room, backward rolling across the room, shrimping across the room, etc., so that by the time you start to teach, everyone is already tired. while the students are drilling, hector is walking around, observing each student, and making corrections/adjustments as needed. after the drilling/warmup, there is sparring. throughout the class, the higher belts are mixing it up and working with lower belts and helping them. after the class was done, hector talked to me some more, and told me that he makes it a point to be the one teaching every single class. even if there are higher belts present, he will still be the one teaching. and by teaching, he is actually teaching, not messing around on his phone and letting people do whatever and potentially hurt themselves or the people they are rolling with. this sold me. i brought my girlfriend the next morning, and we both signed up after participating in the class. i am so glad we found this school. it really is a family atmosphere where every one wants to help each other get better. you can really tell that hector is dedicated and passionate about teaching. whether you are just starting out, or you are looking to maybe change schools, come check out cobrinha and decide for yourself. i thought when you're just starting out, it doesn't matter much which school you go to, because they are all the same in teaching the basics. that is completely incorrect. i feel like i have learned and progressed infinitely more in the 3 months that i have been at cobrinha, than i did in the 8 months that i trained at the other school. and i enjoy coming to class so much more here! they are about to start adding an additional early morning class to accommodate more people's schedules. so come check out the school. i'm glad i did!"
5-star,1,"from the moment my sons and i walked in we felt ""at home""! the warm welcome along with beautiful smiles from professor hector, coaches, and students assured me that this is the place i want to introduce jui jitsu to my sons, nathan (8) and hayden(7). i was recommended by my good friend, ron mortel, who's son, jaden, also trains at cobrinha. professor hector is great and respectful. i admire his warrior mentality while teaching all students the value of teamwork. no matter how long a student has been in the field, the humbleness and openness to all possibilities for a new student is welcomed with open arms. the energy and blessings of each spirit that is part of cobrinha bjj las vegas is remarkable. my sons are so happy they finally get to utilize their strengths and energy while learning discipline, commitment, respect, and responsibility. we have alot of work ahead of us and i am confident that professor hector and all the coaches are always 100% present and ready to support, and make sure nate and hayden are progressing. helen is a huge part of the establishment! so welcoming and informative. you provide all your concerns and needs, she will make sure they are met! tonight i had the honor of attending the strength and conditioning class and i enjoyed it eventhough i had my ""can i do this?!"" moments! after 10 years of not working out and feeling hopeless with my fitness abilities, i am confident that i will get back in shape by signing up for the strength and conditioning class! slowly but surely!!! thank you, cobrinha bjj las vegas for all that you do! so excited for this journey and what we get to learn from all of you!!!"
5-star,1,"we started hunting for a bjj place for our daughter sometime around june 2016. the goal was to find a place that would help her build confidence, further develop respect for self and others, and to keep her active. all the technique and skill she picked up would've just been extra. we've seriously got all that and a whole lot more. it all starts with professor hector and helen. they were very welcoming on her first class, no pressure. just to see if it something she'd be interested. she has gone from a reluctant, shy girl to loving everything about jiu jitsu and being more confident in herself. everything about this place is second to none, from the way the coaches handle the kids' classes to the how hector pushes you to get the best out of yourself. they keep it real and i've seen many kids get better in the 4 months we've been here. we started out with an average class of 15 kids in july and now i sometimes see 45 kids on back-to-back days. most of parents i've spoken to have been in the bjj game for a long time, have transferred here, and they all say ""this is the place to be."" it shows with the attendance and low turnover. many kids come, not many leave. our daughter has been in soccer for a year more than bjj, but if given only one choice, we definitely would stay with hector and cobrinha for as long as we're allowed to. highly recommend. world class teachers. world class family."
5-star,1,"had the pleasure of training the last time i was in vegas for work. great team, great rolls, and hector is a great instructor. $20.00 mat fee but well worth it."
5-star,1,"you are never too young or too old to learn jiu jitsu. professor hector and his partner helen, along with their entire staff, were so welcoming to my family and i. my daughter tried out for their 3 to 5 year old 30 minute class which she enjoyed very much. upon leaving at the end of the night, my daughter proclaimed to me that she could not wait to come back! we came back two days later and she enjoyed it. hector works very well with children and their tournament results prove it! i'd recommend to enroll your kids here in a heart beat. the strength and confidence your child acquires and the technical skills to defend themselves could all be attained here. the sense of belonging in a very safe and family-oriented atmosphere makes this place better than any other gym in the valley! i also took the opportunity for a free trial class. i was provided with a gi to try on and, as a total newbie to the jiu jitsu world, i worked one on one with one of the students prior to the 7pm class to learn some basics. the drills were excellent and the next hour of rolling was very humbling. i was paired with someone much larger than me who i told not to hold back and i realized how much i still needed (and wanted) to learn. rolling is a full body workout, but it is also sharpening yourself mentally. despite how far this gym is to where i live, i chose this place for a few reasons: 1) the staff is very motivated and passionate about their work. they love what they do. 2) their kids jiu jitsu program is excellent. 3) professor hector is a five time world champion. to be the best you first learn from the best. his modern jiu jitsu keeps you ahead of the curve. 4) their customer service is top notch! very important. in a city so saturated with jiu jitsu gyms, the ones who show they actually care about their customer is the gym i want to be a part of. their facility is very clean with lockers and showers, two viewing rooms where families can hang out, refrigerators to keep your food in while you train, and they seem to continue to upgrade the facility with additional sofas i noticed up front today. soon, they'll have to knock down the walls and get a second mat! i've referred quite a few people already (and their kids) and i hope to bring them by soon. i will continue to give them my highest recommendation and my family is looking forward to learning the conbrinha way!"
5-star,1,"let me start by saying i have complete and utter respect for the las vegas cobrinha academy. we were invited by the fonacier family to attend a seminar taught by their kids this past friday. now being that we were out of towers and representing #ufc torrance, hector vasquez and the cobrinha family treated my two boys and my family like they belonged and one of their own. i even forgot to pack my youngest sons pants and they stepped in and loaned us a pair! the coaches were absolutely top notch, energized and helpful which was evident why this academy is one of the best in the world. even though i work for ufc i'm also a huge believer of bjj and as a practitioner ""great is great"" and i can say if you live remotely close to summerlin enroll yourself and kids with hector vasquez and the cobrinha academy las vegas. i give this place a 5 star rating if i lived here we would also be students here! #cobrinhabjj"
5-star,1,"my daughter and husband started doing bjj about 2 years ago, here in las vegas at another gym. my husband got injured after training for a few months, while our daughter continued. she found a passion in competing in tournaments, however, the team that she was with did not focus on tournaments, leaving my daughter stagnant with her bjj technique and not progressing in competition. we started to see a group of coaches in bow ties at tournaments.. not only did their professional attire stand out, but their passion for the sport and the kids on the mat. my family and i watched this team of coaches support their students, win or lose. each competitor from the team always had a coach by their side, something that we were unfamiliar with. a few days later, we walked in to cobrinha bjj academy las vegas, and we were immediately greeted by professor hector. he welcomed us with open arms, and our daughter felt comfortable trying a class with his students. the team graciously accepted my daughter and made her feel that she was a part of their family. we quickly made the decision to change gyms and train with professor hector. his business partner helen, helped make our gym transition smooth and painless. it has been three months now, and we have seen a drastic improvement in our daughter. she has evolved both physically and mentally since being at this academy. my husband has even decided to go back to training, after seeing the family environment that the academy provides. everyone is there to help you, not hurt you, and there are no ego's in the adult classes or the kids classes. we definitely made the right choice when we changed gyms. we encourage everyone to come see the difference in their kids that we have seen in ours. thank you to professor hector, helen, coaches, and the rest of the cobrinha team, who continue to challenge, inspire, and support us."
5-star,1,"awesome atmosphere and all around great place for the family!! if you're looking high level jiu jitsu, this is it. all the coaches and staff made my daughter (who's 12) feel right at home. thank you so much!"
5-star,1,incredible! everyone is extremely down to earth. you won't find inflated egos at this school. everyone helps everyone and the mass amount of talent is incredible. i'm proud and blessed to be part of such and amazing team.
5-star,1,"my son is a brazilian jiu jitsu student at twisted fitness in madison, wisconsin, an alliance gym. when we planned our trip to california for the ibjjf pan tournament, we decided to go by way of las vegas. (no judging... please). my son had a great desire to receive training from an alliance academy. he was more than excited when he found that hector vasquez had a bjj academy in las vegas. he visited the gym and loved it so much that we change our travel plans to allow him more time to train with hector. training for my son with hector and his students was an awesome experience. he can't wait to go back to las vegas (very soon) to do it again. the students were welcoming and demonstrated the hospitality that was obviously handed down by example of their professor - hector. my experience as a parent was outstanding. helen shelby (director of marketing) was so friendly and welcoming to both me and my son. i felt immediately at home with helen, hector, and the students. i couldn't wait to get back to the gym just to spend a little more time with these exceptional people. i genuinely miss them already and i've only been home to wisconsin for a couple of days. we will be returning to las vegas just as soon as we possibly can for some excellent bjj training and to visit our new and treasured friends, hector, helen, and the students. thank you hector, helen, and all the students who made our travels complete with training, friendship, and a bond with the las vegas alliance brotherhood/sisterhood that we love so much. please take your kids, teenagers, parents, grand-parents or anyone else who is looking for some great physical activity, self-defense training, and first-rate brazillian jiu jitsu to hector and helen at cobrinha brazilian jiu jitsu academy las vegas or call them at (702) 527-5122 for more information and the best training and genuine hospitality."
5-star,1,"i found them on instagram, contacted them and was invited in. i was greeted by everyone and felt welcomed right from the gate. i've trained in numerous gyms on both coasts and i can highly recommend this gym for anyone trying to improve there jiujitsu game, for pro fighters or for regular fitness or self defense. it's for everyone!"
5-star,1,world class instruction! you will not find another gym in the vegas area as good as this one. hector will take your jiujitsu game to a whole new level. this is the gym and this is the team you want standing with you and pushing you to smash through your jiujitsu goals!! cobrinha is the place to train!!
5-star,1,"when i found out that they take 3 year olds to start training in jiu-jitsu with no hesitation, i wanted to sign up my little one. and went she actually tried the class, she had so much fun. i'm so impress with the amount of patience the coaches have in teaching this age group. now the entire family trains at this gym. and the best thing about this gym is that, everyone is family."
5-star,1,"in a town full of ""mma"" gyms, i was able to find a place to train jiujitsu that epitomizes the true spirit of martial arts...i came to train while i was in town and saw a cobrinha gym had just opened up. hector is warm and welcoming as a person and attentive as well as passionate as an instructor (that's not even touching on his championship pedigree). his ethic and attitude are well reflected in his students as they are all courteous with serious jiujitsu chops. helen also contributed to the positive atmosphere of the gym. i've trained martial arts my whole life and still coach at my own gym in the bay area. there aren't many places like this...and it's refreshing to see that martial arts is still alive and well. do yourself a favor...if you're going to train-make this place the place for you and your family."
5-star,1,"we live across town from this school but it is worth the commute. my son really enjoyed the trial class, so much that i signed him up at the next class. you are treated like family from the moment you walk in. he's been to 3 classes so far and has absorbed the technique very well. he enjoys it to the point that he doesn't want to leave when the class is over. i highly recommend cobrinha. once you take the trial class and you'll be hooked."
5-star,1,"when i heard professor takes young students as young as 3 years old, it was a not a hard decision to make to join the cobrinha team/family. professor hector and helen has done wonders for my girls and provided the keys needed to live a healthy jiu jitsu lifestyle. in just less than 2 months my oldest daughter (8 years old) has change so much and change all her bad junk food habit to healthy habits. i know my girls are in good hands when they are under the guidance of professor hector and helen. i to am a student and i never seen such a big improvement in my game under this system. the thing i love most about this gym is it is really a family environment gym. everyone treats everyone the same no matter if you a student a worker. i would recommend cobrinah to anyone if they want a real family environment to evolve your jiu jitsu game. almogela ohana"
5-star,1,hector and i have only met at tournaments when his kids team would compete against mine. his students were always the hardest to compete with because of their awesome technique due to hectors coaching. las vegas has a new sherriff in town with this academy. if you have a kid that wants to be great this is the place to be. this is coming from a different school owner with no affiliation with this academy. that alone says a lot and speaks volumes this is the place to be.
5-star,1,"cory is a great guy and a great fitness instructor. he really cares about his clients and works to modify any exercise as needed. i attended daily group 'boot camp' classes and loved every one. there are so many different time options you are bound to find one that fits your schedule. the gym has an intimate vibe and is full of positive energy. don't be fooled by 'boot' camp, its more of a circuit where you work to your level at each station. i definitely recommend cory and core fitness!"
5-star,1,"look i went to these guys two years ago. i was searching for a place to get back in shape and get motivated about my health. i met with alex, a personal trainer at core. he showed me some simple thing so could do that will not hurt me or bring further stress into my life. 2 years later, it took me that long yes, part of it was all negativity from failed workouts beforehand. it's been two weeks and i love the boot camp i'm in. i'm doing things that i thought i wouldn't be able to do otherwise, being ex collegiate athlete in the football arena. seriously though, if you're looking for the place to get started the right way and learn how to exercise and like it or if you need to find your inner athlete...you just found the place. 5 star and thanks core fitness."
5-star,1,"first of all i want to say that these guys are phenomenally talented at what they do. if you're unsure about starting a new fitness routine with a personal trainer, i strongly suggest you try out these guys at core fitness; you will not be disappointed. i've trained with many private personal fitness trainers in the past, and was often left disappointed and frustrated. core fitness is definitely a very different atmosphere that made me enjoy working out. i immediately felt the positive energy the very first time i stepped into the studio! they will help you achieve your goals very quickly! - assuming you do your part as a client, of course! my trainer (spencer) is a very patient and kind man. he made an effort to go the extra mile and guide me through the workout routines in a way that i always understood. he never hesitated to re-explain himself if i was ever unsure. even though i had my moments (like being stubborn or late showing up to my sessions!) he never lost his cool and was always a gentleman about it. core fitness is a great place to train and improve your life. thank you cory & your awesome staff for helping me get this far and i look forward to moving ahead with you guys!"
5-star,1,"simply the best bootcamp to attend, personal attention was given to me to improve my workout and i loved the group of worman who keep me motivated! i highly recommend core fitness!"
5-star,1,"core fitness is small studio gym with group classes and personal training sessions. what i love about core fitness is that it is never, ever crowded (group classes cap at 5 people), and you get a lot of personal attention for the trainers. i'm a bit self-conscious (i think everyone trying to lose weight is!) so it's great to know there aren't people looking at you or anyone intimidating around. the trainers are kind, knowledgeable, helpful, and never pressure you to do anything you're not comfortable with. they are willing to work with your schedule and have lots of different programs and specials. 5 stars!"
5-star,1,"i came, i saw, i sweet and i lost (weight). thanks cory! i could have never done this without the commitment of a trainer. going it alone would have been fruitless as always."
5-star,1,i have been training with core fitness for several years. cory is professional knowledgable and very positive in meeting the goals and expectations of his clients. i highly recommend him. he has transformed my physique and i couldn't be happier with the results. thank you cory!
5-star,1,"i appreciate how cory allows for my unique physical, family and professional circumstances in developing a fitness plan that works for me. in addition to his excellent environment and technical approach, he is always enjoyable to work with. i recommend giving cory a try. you will be happy you did. i am."
3-star,0,not many people using the gym. there are six courts set up and still have vacancy. suttons and racquets are supplied for players. the drawback is the floor is slippery.
4-star,1,"usually packed on weekends and after 7, which sucks if you are working. limited machines and racks, so if you are planning on squat day, make sure to do it in the mornings or just a bit before it's closing. no complaint about the staff. they are always helpful and friendly. the price here is way too much. closes before 10 on weekdays (mon to thurs). if you are looking for a fitness centre, look somewhere else unless it's walking distance from your house (which for me it is). they do have other facilities that are included but the price is not worth it."
4-star,1,"i've been a member at cornell cc for 3 months now. of all the markham ccs, i would say this one is the best. the fitness facilities are clean, bright (lots of windows) and this is the only cc in markham that has a large enough stretch/open space area for self-directed/mat work outs. the changing room is, for the most part, clean however the bathrooms are hit and miss. there have been a number of times where it was not well maintained, or toilet paper/soap had run out. the staff members are friendly. i usually go during weekday evenings between 6-7 and it's never packed. i haven't had to wait for a cardio machine or equipment so far. overall, i'm a fan of this place. it beats a lot of those chain gyms like goodlife or fit for less that are packed and humid during peak hours. i am on the flexible plan (month to month) and it costs me the same as gl or ffl. parking is never an issue and easy."
4-star,1,"nice clean facilities!! lots of wide open space. they could use more seating area near the pool viewing area, but they have the seating in the upper level. coffee/snack shop available!! nice touch. lots of parking in the parking garage. some spots are tight due to some drivers who have problems parking."
3-star,0,"lovely community centre. very modern, bright and spacious building. i typically use the library, pool and children's programs. i took points off for the following reasons: the pool decks are not always as clean as the could be. i come here with my kids for swimming, as do many families, and i'm not sure how often the change areas are cleaned. the snack bar in the building is not the greatest. i've only ever tried their baked goods but those always taste stale to me. have not yet tried their prepared food. parking is free if you get your ticket validated indoors, which is easy to do. overall it's a nice place and a beloved addition to our community!"
4-star,1,"cornell is one of the prettiest and best community centres in markham! (not biased, because i do take shifts there on occasion) this community centre is huge and definitely screams 'community'. it's located right beside the hospital and that creates the worst part of the centre - the parking. ugh! the parking is a nightmare on weekends and when there's a swim meet in the pool. there is simply not enough space in the little lot and if you have to park on the street, you'll get a ticket. i've actually been late for my shifts because i had to park in the residential areas ... are you kidding? also, the parking lot is a 'paid' lot, as in you have to get a ticket and you pay on the way out at the front desk. (you pay after a few hours) the pool is lovely. it's huge, bright and spacious. the pool has a nice slide and a therapeutic pool- which a lot of pools don't have. it's definitely a 'hot tub' and it's a nice relaxing area after your swim. the pool is never really 'busy' as many of the markham pools are, and it's at a nice temperature so you can get a good endurance swim in. the viewing gallery is built for swim meets so it's huge, with a large overlook of the pool. the gym is a bit small, with not a lot of room for barbell lifting. i've only worked out there once, and the ventilation is not great. had to stop running after awhile because i couldn't breathe well. i love the fact they have a running track. indoor running tracks are just amazing. the facility also has a huge empty gym area for drop in sports (basketball, volleyball etc) and an indoor playground for kids. the library is very modern (the outside looks like burberry lol) and the inside is organized and it just seems like a great place to study. cornell is also getting a new cafe, which is a nice change from the other city of markham pools, which have nothing or a small dingy snack bar that's rarely open. this community centre is super spacious and very nice. i like to work here and i like to visit, even if i live on the other side of markham."
5-star,1,great service when booking and having my son's birthday party in the playgym. the party room is big and everyone complimented the cleanliness and location
4-star,1,"cornell community centre is definitely a welcome addition to the neighbourhood. with the increase of population in the new subdivisions, this is about time city of markham adds more facilities for the residents in the area. full fitness centre (requires membership), group fitness room (city sponsored fitness classes), swimming pool, running track, multi use gymnastic area that have drop in sport programs for all ages, children playground and group and even a special area for older adults. the only thing missing maybe is a skating rink, but there are markham cc, angus glen cc if you want to go leisure skate. the building is nicely design and just need some finishing touches. ample parking at least for now, i have to wait till everything running then i will know."
5-star,1,"great environment and great people to be around. both carson and liz are very knowledgeable and do a tremendous job of welcoming people with open arms. they support each individual and their goals. they make the workouts enjoyable with variety of movements and changing up the pace from day to day, week to week. i look forward to coming back to the gym when i move back this fall."
5-star,1,"i've been going to crossfit fsi for just about a year and cannot say enough great things about this gym! all of the trainers are so nice, knowledgeable, and make you feel comfortable in your own skin. i've never done a move or been put in a position where i thought i was going to get hurt and i've never felt bad about my skill level as compared to someone else. the atmosphere here is so welcoming and the small class sizes make you feel like you have a personal trainer who is watching your every move and making sure you doing the exercises correctly. in addition to great coaches, the community of people here is unlike anything else! i can have the worst day at work or be really stressed out and as soon as i walk through those doors, my mood completely changes and i'm laughing within minutes. i'm so grateful to have this gym and these people in my life and i'm proud to say that i'm the healthiest i've ever been and in the best shape of my life! i would highly recommend this gym to anyone regardless of your skill level, age, or goals. carson, dallas, liz, and stefan have all been amazing to me and i don't have plans of stopping anytime soon!"
5-star,1,"after touring all of the crossfit gyms in the area, i chose crossfit fsi and i'm so happy i did! carson and liz took the time to get to know me and my fitness goals. the other gyms i visited only offered a 30 minute introductory class to teach me all of the crossfit moves, which i knew wasn't right for me. at crossfit fsi, they structured a program to get me get me up to speed over time, where i could learn the moves and improve my fitness at my own pace. now i regularly attend classes and feel like i am making real progress on my fitness journey. carson and liz make the classes fun and challenging, and for the first time in my life i look forward to working out. couldn't be happier with my choice of crossfit gym and would recommend fsi to anyone."
5-star,1,"carson, stefan, liz and dallas are the most knowledgeable, professional trainers as well as some of the coolest and kindest group of people you would ever want to meet.they always make me feel welcome and encourage my progress. i started seeing carson a year and a half ago. when i came in i was still recovering from a broken back and spent a year of being stagnant while learning to walk again. now i have lost 35 pounds while adding muscle and my back has never been stronger, i have no pain at all and i can now squat near 300lbs. my health has never been better and through their nutritional counseling i went from a serious high risk diabetic to complete remission. in the past i've been to other trainers who insisted on driving me so hard i would spend days recovering. at crossfit fsi all the trainers know about my medical history and never to put me in situations where i would hurt myself or re-injure my back. they are very knowledgeable and always explain the science and benefits of the exercises in a way i can understand. starting at basic movement and correct form they built me up from the ground up. i have boundless energy and my quality of life is amazing. they are teachers who love what they do and are always expanding their knowledge in both technique and extra certifications. they even follow up with with me after tough sessions to check in and see how i'm feeling. you couldn't ask for a better experience with some of the best group of people i know. other clients i've meet are fun to be around and i've made some great friendships. i look forward to both my classes and my personal training sessions with carson...that is no small feat for me:-) i completely trust them in both their skill and my well being. their prices are great, the results are remarkable and i cannot give them enough praise."
5-star,1,"crossfit fsi is the ultimate fitness experience- just the right combination of cardio, strength, flexibility and mobility training while having fun with certified trainers and motivated clients. no two workouts are ever identical so you never get bored. the trainers provide guidance on stretching before and after workouts so you can perform at your best and get results. their fitness programs help you look and feel fantastic. i've worked out with many trainers over the years and crossfit fsi trainers are by far the best."
5-star,1,"i love carson and all the amazing trainers at fsi. carson has kept my husband motivated in his workouts for the past several years. his attention to mechanics and flexibility prevents injury and maximizes results. my son, a high school athlete, trains here with several of his teammates. fsi does a great job of motivating them, tracking their progress and preparing them for the season. my daughter and i have also found a place to belong at fsi-- we take the yoga classes on tuesday and thursday evenings. it is a completely non-intimidating environment where people of many different levels can practice together and truly feel comfortable. i guess what i like best about fsi is the way i always feel comfortable when i'm there. i never feel like i'm being judged. instead, i feel like carson and his friends have an incredible belief in my potential and they're eager to encourage me along the way. you will love the fun and highly qualified staff at crossfit fsi !"
5-star,1,"i really like this gym. i have only been training here for a couple of months but have seen great results. this gym takes it back to the basics which i enjoy--squats, lunges, jump ropes, stretching etc. i also like how they don't nickel and dime you for every service. you are able to try things out and find out what works best for you. the gym is ran by 2 families and you can usually meet all of them if you are there. they care a lot about their gym and are happy to help you. i have met a couple different clients while working out and loved the stories. one man was told he would be in a wheel chair in 6 month due to his medical condition. this particular man started training/stretching here and 6 years later he is walking--with a cane, but still walking. many more stories like this one.. just ask carson :)"
5-star,1,"everyone needs to check out this gym!! unbelievable repor with their clients!! they will motivate with the most positive attitudes!!!! always achieving major results that you desire! this is a must have in your life!! get a membership now before they blow up so big, you'll never be able to get a trainer. oh and not mention.... the stretching they do, is life changing!!! oh man!!!! the best!!!!"
5-star,1,"well this is my gym and of course i love it! lots of different training no one way for anyone. want to workout have a good time workout on making your self more fit this might be a great place for you or of you are hurt they train lots of prevention and mobility, stability training and technique. or if you just want to get stronger there is a weightlifting club as well!"
5-star,1,my girlfriend and i dropped in from san antonio. this box has a friendly feel. it's large and has the equipment needed to get a great workout. coach rob is a blast. he put us through a great warmup and challenging wod. he's super knowledgeable as well. you can't go wrong if you're on vacation and need a place to get a great workout.
1-star,0,iam very disappointed with this place and with its owner. he wasted my time once when he didn't show up for my first appointment and nobody knew that i had an appointment that they. then a day later he contacted me and we reschedule the appointment but again the night before the appointment he cancelled me. for those reasons i consider this place is very informal.not professional and not recommendable at all.
5-star,1,this was a great experience. very welcoming coaches. clean well equipped gym. i took an uber ride from the strip where i was staying and i went twice. very reasonably priced and a high value. i would go again when visiting vegas.
5-star,1,"saw the add in facebook about a 6 weeks challenge and decided to give it a try. i was very upfront, all i care about is to get great looking body, not sport just ""body"". i came after another bootcamp, where i have stopped seeing results and was super exhausted by going 5 days a week. what i like about las vegas crossfit that their program built on lyfting. so if you want to explore in world of fitness, i would definetly recomend it. they start step by step, watch your posture, always making sure you do things correct way. there are bunch of people who is not hard core in sport like me, and i feel like las crossfit is only one place that gives a chance to try what is all about. trainers. beside the great energy vibe, understanding, they have an amazing knowledge of what they are doing and experience. everyone is fitness trainer our day, the reason i trusted myselft to las vegas crossfit, because they are real professionlas. i cant stress enought about jason and allison. i think they take evrything what they do personally, and thats what makes people, even like me to go back."
5-star,1,"we were vacationing for the week with family and wanted to keep up with our training. our box in socal is crossfit saga but cflv made us feel right at home. the wife and i took the early class after signing up and paying the drop in fee online. we trained with four other members and they were really nice. the staff was great, the place was clean, and plenty of bars/ weights for everyone. we look forward to visiting again when we take our quarterly trips to vegas."
5-star,1,"my 100th review will go to my 2nd home and 2nd family-- crossfit las vegas! i know, i know, there's a crazy stigma around the word and the brand ""crossfit"" that scares people off just from hearing it. i'll admit, i've heard some things prior to my decision to come here but i was tired of the normal routines at the local gyms n not having access to the equipment when i needed it. ever run into that issue? ever run into the issue of being intimidated by ""dying"" or ""getting killed"" or (insert some injury here) at cf gym? well... i've been here now for 1.5 years n am still alive and breathing fine. just stronger, faster, healthier, n am enjoying life a little more n excited to take on new adventures and sports. what makes this particular gym unique from the other 40+ in the las vegas area? because some of the movements can be technical, they start u off working 1 on 1 with an experienced knowledgeable coach to take u through the movements and for myself, some of the most basic human movements that i've lost touch with especially a normal, plain air squat! love the community that i'm a part of and love the challenges i face in the gym that gives me the focus outside of the gym to make my life even better! especially love having showers to use if i have plans to go out or before i go into work! not a lot of gyms offer this to members! there's even a noonie goonie potluck (12pm class) every 1st thursday of the month, they have grass fed beef, whole milk & eggs delivered for pick up, organic produce, geez! i don't wanna give away all the perks without u guys checking em out! cheers to more years to come!!! and if u inquire, let me know butterz (my aka here!) sent ya!"
1-star,0,"i've never attended this box, nor would i ever. and maybe it's a bit unfair to judge the entire gym off of my experience with one coach, but i am about to be in vegas for week long conference and was looking to drop into a box while traveling. crossfit las vegas had been the first result in my search so i browsed the website to find more information about what to do when visiting. as stated, they ask that you complete an online waiver, as well as create an account to register for the classes. the information they obtained was the general name, number etc. as well as which coach you'd like to train with which of course i have no idea as i've never been. a little while later, i had received a voice mail from joe telling me that he saw that i had registered online and was interested in getting started with crossfit las vegas. had then returned his call and got his voice mail in return, yet let him know that i would only be visiting and would love to hear more information about what was needed to drop in as a visitor. a few hours pass and i had missed a call from joe yet again (this was during the day while i was at work), and proceeded to immediately call him back. when he picked up the phone i said something along the lines of hey this is brandy, i had inquired about coming to cflv while in town, and he said oooh yeah, i didn't mean to call you the second time, i dialed the wrong number..... (what i took from that, sorry, was never going to call once you said you weren't signing up for a membership). afterwards, it was almost like pulling teeth to get the information i had initially wanted, and could tell he thought he had better things to do with his time. maybe it was an off day for him? maybe they don't like visitors? either way, in my experience, crossfit encompasses so many things. it's a business but it's also a community, and i'd rather not waste my time or money being somewhere that doesn't make you feel wanted."
4-star,1,worked out at the 6am class while in vegas for work. it was great to be able to wod while traveling. everyone in the class was very nice and i got a great workout. the gym is co-located with another gym / weightlifting facility. at the time i visited 8/2014 the front room / lobby area was under construction.
4-star,1,"good place for a heck of a workout. not really into cross fit but its good for cross training if done right. i enjoy the fast paced, push your self workouts though and you will definetly get pushed. check it out but go with an actual understanding of what cross fit really is."
5-star,1,"okay. i have been a member of cflv for almost 6 months now and should have written the kind of review that it deserves months ago. it is the continued outstanding leadership of the owner and the relationships that i have formed with the other members that has compelled me to finally write this review. so here it goes: i moved to vegas in january 2013 and didn't know a single person in this city. i had been doing crossfit for a little over a year and knew that my first step (before purchasing a bed or ya know, finding a job) was to find what would be my next cfit gym. i simply google'd 'crossfit las vegas' and whataya know. cflv was the first to pop up on my search. i didn't even look around the site, research yelp reviews or anything - just needed to find the hours of operation and a contact. i sent the owner (joe) an email and he told me to drop-in the next day during his class. (10am). now, as outgoing and fearless as i am, i was really nervous. to the point that i almost didn't go. it took the encouragement of the coaches from my previous gym and texts from all of my friends to convince me to actually show up. the 10am class that day was pretty small, about 7-10 people (3 of which ended up becoming my best friends). everyone was super friendly and inviting and the wod was killer. joe asked my thoughts when it was over and i told him that i was pretty convinced cflv would be my new box. he encouraged me to try some other places, making sure i knew that there were gyms much closer to me..and that's when i knew this gym was unlike any other. joe wasn't worried about another dollar sign coming through the door, he genuinely cared about the people and making sure they got what they needed out of crossfit. two weeks went by and i still hadn't found a job so i hadn't returned to sign up and pay my first month of membership. i had to use what little money i had on things like food and gas (so annoying) and i felt crossfit calling out to me every morning when my alarm went off and i knew i should be heading to 6am class. one afternoon i got an email from joe, asking if i had been able to find a gym and how my transition to vegas was going. that's when i was sold. not only did this place care about me in regards to crossfit, i was clearly valued as a person as well. i emailed back and told him he'd be seeing my bright, smiling face the very next day because even though i hadn't visited any other gyms, i felt confident i was making the right decision. i took a trip to coinstar that night and showed up for his 10am class the next day. over the last few months as my jobs and schedule have changed, i am no longer able to make joe's 10am classes. i bounced back and forth between 830am and 6am before finally settling on the suicide hour of 6. michael ty became my regular coach and this guy seriously knows his stuff. he's tough and he may play country music to irritate you, but his athletic and coaching ability are unmatched by any other gym that i've ever been to. the quality of training seen at cflv in general is unlike any other that i've experienced. it's simply, elite. a few months ago i injured myself and my cfit career hasn't been the same since. i continued to push and keep up my 4-5x/week regimen before my body threw up the white flag. i have since taken the last 2 months off but kept my membership going in hopes that one day i would magically wake up healed. no such miracle has occurred yet, but i digress. money became an issue and i was seriously considering putting my membership on hold as it was no use to me. joe got wind of this and immediately reached out to me. he has since become an integral part of my rehab and re-dedication to crossfit and i couldn't be more grateful. he has proven yet again that he cares about every single one of his members. whether you're just in town to visit, new to town, or a vegas native - consider stopping by crossfit las vegas. it is full of friendly people who are always looking to expand their family of friends. (and give you a good ass-kicking in the process)!"
2-star,0,"was visiting and my buddies from home wanted me pick to them up a crossfit las vegas shirt. plus i grew up in vegas, so i wanted to find a gym that i could send my local friends to. i don't remember the guys name but he was not helpful at all. he seemed super unfriendly and didn't really care about selling me a shirt. he was teaching a class so i can understand him being pre-occupied but that doesn't mean you can be rude. i fell in love with crossfit because of the environment and the people. in my opinion that atmosphere is a reflection of the owner/trainers. i didn't get a shirt"
5-star,1,"i dropped in as a visitor with my boyfriend last friday for the 9am class. vili checked us in at the front and got us ready to go. he was also our trainer for the class. i loved that there was only 5 of us taking the class. 9am is pretty early for las vegas. the space was big, they also had a lot of equipment. the wod involved tabata. it was a great work out, high intensity. vili was a great trainer and coached me one on one when he had the chance. he was also encouraging towards everyone. since my boyfriend and i have a house in vegas we will definitely be back!"
5-star,1,"crossfit hurts so good! we have a love/hate relationship and i couldn't be happier. this is a long review. sorry. but it truly reflects on just how awesome this gym is. if you have any reservations, please read and consider my words. if you're looking to really get into shape and make a life change, this is the place for you! let me start by saying i wasn't stoked to join crossfit in the beginning. my fiancé talked me into it and i went in with a completely open-mind. my mindset beforehand was that it would be your typical douchebag gym (sorry, just being real) and that there would be your stereotypical gym rats, girls wearing makeup with their hair down trolling dudes and ditto for the jock type dudes trolling girls. ya know, kind of like lvac. they also placed a lot of emphasis on community, so that worried me, as i'm there to get my workout on, not to make friends. how wrong i was..... i'm still a newbie and just entered my third week of on ramp - which is basically a class that meets three days a week for the first month you join. it assists in teaching you each and every lift so that you've mastered it before jumping into the real classes. i've learned so much and my form is getting better and better. mind you, i've never been a lifter. i've always been in ballet, gymnastics, running and yoga. so this is all very new to me. i appreciate this class so much as it really teaches you how to master these lifts. this is vital as it will avoid future injury, and, well, you'll know what you're doing. makes sense, eh? the coaches are incredible! in the past, i've participated in several boot camp classes around the vegas area and am used to having some jerk screaming at me. it never really bothered me, but it would've been nice to have some encouragement in the midst of all the yelling. i mean, i wasn't joining the marines, but it kinda felt like i was with all the confrontational yelling. also, my previous boot camp instructors never really taught us exactly how to perform a move, whether it be lifting, crawling on the floors.. whatever. it was all about banging it out, which could result in injuries later in life. the coaches at crossfit are completely opposite. they pay close attention to what you're doing and mastering your form in each lift. and it's not just lifting weights.. it's pull ups, sit ups, jump ropes, stretching, etc..etc.. they're very encouraging and have played a vital role in motivating myself and all of the other members in my current class. i honestly look forward to working out. i'm currently in the 7am class. and let me just say, i am not a morning person. honestly, watching the sun rise to me is overrated. i hate mornings. i. hate. mornings. but the workouts kick a** and are an excellent way to start off the day. oh, and, again the coaches play a big role in that. so getting up at 6am to work out ain't bad at all. they have a ton of classes available to work with your schedule. for on ramp (your beginner month) their earliest class is at 7am but they offer other time slots. once you hit the real classes and are done with your initial training month, they have classes that start as early as 6am but also have a zillion other time slots available. another thing, is that they teach you on healthy eating habits. they're pretty content with the paleo diet, however, i'm not a big meat eater and i'm a lover of cheese. don't get me wrong, that's a personal preference, but i've heard rave reviews in regard to the paleo diet, so it's definitely something to consider. i plan on taking any additional healthy habits that they teach me. to me, it will be all about moderation and making healthy foodie choices. oh, and the gym is a gym. straight up. no bells and whistles. it's large, open and clean. i must repeat, if you're looking to really get into shape and make a life change,this is the place for you! they have free open classes on saturdays for people to come and give it go. you don't have to sign up, but it will give you a taste of what crossfit and the coaches have to offer. i repeat: you don't have to sign up. the coaches allow you to make this decision, they don't pressure you into doing something you're not 100% in agreeance with. there were a few people in my first free saturday class that didn't join and the coaches were like, ""cool! come back any time and have a great day!"" give them a call, ask for joe marsh, he's a cool dude (or any coach) and they'll be happy to get you in for a free saturday class. you are also welcome to email them. they are usually very quick to respond. believe me, you won't regret it. worst case scenario, you get a good workout in, meet some nice people and that's that. no harm done."
5-star,1,"what can i say, this place is like a second home. i've been a cflv member for 2 years now and i am in the best shape of my life. the coaches are amazing and highly motivating. you always feel like you're part of a team, yet the competitive element of crossfit keeps you challenging yourself to work harder. everyone encourages each other to do well and that makes each and every workout feel great, no matter how hard it is. the gym itself is huge. the workouts are scaled to your level so that anyone can do them. when i started, i couldn't do one pull-up, and now i can bust them out like i'm gsp. i highly encourage anyone to give it a try. i guarantee you will be hooked."
5-star,1,"$10 visitor drop in rate if your coach emails them to let them know you're dropping by... overall one of the largest and most spacious crossfit boxes in the country that i've ever seen... if you're looking for a great workout to squeeze all those toxins out from a night in sin city, then crossfit las vegas is a good place to do so."
5-star,1,"i had the lucky chance to score a living social voucher to attend crossfit las vegas's on ramp introductory session. it is definitely introductory, but the wods are still pretty intense and you get a pretty good work out. my onramp buddies were pretty lucky because our group got joe marsh as our instructor. he definitely knows his crossfit! he was able to teach us all of the right form and techniques for the majority of the crossfit exercises as well as any progressions if we could not physically do the exercise yet. he even taught us different ways of stretching to help the tense muscles you get from crossfit work outs. he likes to quiz the class to ensure that everyone knows the answers and he has a way of getting everyone in the class involved and pumped to get a good work out. i definitely enjoyed the onramp session and plan to join crossfit las vegas on my next paycheck. crossfit is not your normal workout regimen, it's definitely going to be a change of lifestyle and i can't wait to begin that journey with crossfit las vegas!"
5-star,1,"joe marsh is doing a great job in explaining all of the movments and keeping us from injuring ourselves. i'm in the on ramp course which is an intro to cross fit and helps establish proper form for the movements. the end of each day is a highly intense workout which always kicks my butt, but its totally worth the whooping to feel stronger! i highly recommend at least the on ramp (that's all i have experience with) for anyone who either has or will have fitness and strength training as a part of their life!"
5-star,1,"i had the pleasure of visiting cf lv while on vacation last week and although i didn't workout there (stomach virus yuck) joe did take time out of his day to talk to me and answer quite a long list of questions i had about his gym. if you're in the vegas area and you are looking for a gym that is professional and welcoming with a very strong and supportive community, then you can't do any better than crossfit las vegas. -great space -variety of classes -trainers were at one point gym members who then wanted to become coaches so they're passionate and committed -family fun events (bbqs, batting cages, bowling) -a welcoming place for all types of people regardless of previous experience or athletic/fitness goals"
5-star,1,"i've been working out at cflv for almost 2.5 years now and couldn't imagine going anywhere else! the workouts are programmed to promote overall health, fitness, and results. the coaches encourage their athletes throughout the work out and even through community outreach! the classes are programmed to accommodate all skill levels and with the new location/management they are even offering a barbell class (weight training). not only are the coaches amazing, but so are all the members. i consider many of them amongst my closest friends and love being able to workout with them every week! bottom line: this gym is amazing!"
5-star,1,"i have been working out at crossfit las vegas for almost a full year now and absolutely love this crossfit community. the gym is in a huge space with lots of equipment and a variety of different coaching techniques. whether you want to get fit, lose some weight, work on your gymnastics skills, your olympic weightlifting skills, or get stronger, they have something for everyone. the best part about cflv to me is the community that comes with it. the gym has wonderful trainers who actually care about your well being and are there to answer anything you'd like them to. not only are the trainers wonderful people but the members there have helped to push me to do things i never thought possible. i am fitter than i've ever been in my life and it is all thanks to my friends over at cflv. keep up the good work guys!"
2-star,0,"great open floor plan. this gym is huge for a crossfit gym. but every time i drop in there for a work out it gets more and more of a lvac atmosphere. the instruction is good if you get the right trainer. some wont notice you if they don't know you, where as others are right on top of you making sure that every technical move you make is correct. the classes can be kinda big but they have enough equipment to support larger classes. so if you get in on the right day at the right time you could be getting great instruction and a great workout. but for the price i would expect a more steady level of instruction and not just the trainers helping their friends. but for a drop in from time to time its not too bad."
5-star,1,"this is the best work out experience i have ever had! i am starting from scratch and these guys are helping like no other workout facility has. it is hard and they expect a lot of you....but they are motivators and the other members are so helpful. no matter the skill or fitness level, everyone seems to want others to succeed. they cheer you on and stop to help without hesitation! i am achieving gains in fitness i ahve dreamed of for decades!"
5-star,1,"whooo!!! i love this place!!!!!! it is amazing! everyone is great fun to be around, the trainers are skilled and knowledgeable!! i place is small but functional! well laid out, and plenty of equipment! they also like to take the workouts outside weather permitting! they play tag sometimes too! they always are making the work out fun but challenging!! they do a share the pain every month were you can come on in and see what goes on around the gym and if you like it then you can decide to join it! just check out their website for all that information. crossfitlasvegas.com"
5-star,1,"hate nothing. dislike availability of sessions throughout the week. workout music is hardly updated. like the simple layout and size of the gym. love the motivational, highly skilled trainers. the various workouts of the day (wods). movements are scalable to any weight, disability or fitness level. sense of community among its members. ability to keep track of progress through actual whiteboard or beyond the whiteboard computer program. availability of a microwave and refrigerator for pre- and post-workout nutrition."
4-star,1,"great folks that know the crossfit techniques and have an enormous amount of tolerance for new people. the folks that work out at the gym are great. no egos and all are very encouraging. if you are looking to get in the best shape of your life in the shortest time, you must sign up at crossfit las vegas!"
5-star,1,"if you are a crossfitter in sin city avoid the buffets, and hit up cflv. they have an amazing facility just south of the strip (walking distance from mandalay bay area) with great coaches. its a crossfitters nightmare to go on vacation and not have a good box to get a wod in. cflv has you covered!"
5-star,1,"it is very rare you come across a gym that has both an exceedingly caring and knowledgeable staff as well as a true sense of community amongst its members. don't be fooled, this place will kick your ass. but for that ass-kicking, you will not find a better equipped and better staffed crossfit gym in las vegas."
5-star,1,"i can't say enough about this place. i have been going to crossfit las vegas for just over a month and already my body has changed. i feel stronger, look stronger, am losing fat, gaining muscle, and i have so much more energy throughout the day. i just feel healthier. joe and zach are awesome; they really help you learn correct form and will nail you if you aren't doing an exercise correctly. :) workouts are scaled to your ability- but joe and zach push you to do your best and work hard. i leave the gym feeling like i have accomplished something and pushed myself beyond what i thought i could do. and to top it off, the camaraderie at the gym is like nothing else i have experienced in vegas. everyone is awesome, inspiring, and unlike most gyms around here, it's great to actually get to know the people you are working out next to! if you are looking for something to really get yourself into shape, and aren't afraid of a little hard work, then crossfit las vegas is your place. :)"
5-star,1,"i dropped in today to crossfit phx... what a great place... awesome people and very inviting. if your in town and looking for a drop in, do yourself a favor and go to phx!"
5-star,1,"i stopped by crossfit phx during a trip to scottsdale. the gym, it's coaches, and it's members were great. i highly recommend this box!"
4-star,1,crossfit phx is an excellent gym with great staff and an even more amazing community. i think crossfit phx really helped me step into crossfit with ease and knowing that i could ask the coaches questions at anytime was great. i'd for sure recommend crossfit phx to any one of my friends.
5-star,1,i've been to a lot of crossfit gyms. this might be the best one. coaches are top notch. instruction is on point. community is great. i had purchased a groupon for another crossfit in the area and ended up moving to this gym because it was so good. if only all crossfit gyms could be like this! i will be back.
5-star,1,excellent gym. my wife and i have been going here for almost 5 years. coaches are extremely patient and attentive. the community is like family to us.
5-star,1,"i joined 2 month's ago and couldn't be happier. i'm already in better shape than i've ever been in my life, and i really owe it all to the amazing coaches at phx. i'd heard a lot about crossfit over the years but never gave it a chance. finally, with some free time this fall and on the recommendation of a close friend, i gave phx a shot. i was hooked after my first class. the family is so tight knit and yet they immediately welcomed me as one of their own. they have all been patient as i've slowly developed my technique, and yet always push me to push myself further every class. everyone is friendly and encouraging, and there to help. the free weekly passes over at core power yoga are just icing on the cake, and much needed recovery after a tough wod. i highly recommend you check out this gym, you won't be disappointed."
5-star,1,i travel often for work and have to find places to drop in. this is one of the best gyms i have dropped into! great programming that is challenging and you feel like you got plenty of out of the hour class. super friendly and welcoming box. i can tell they have a great community and still welcoming to newbies. i suggest anyone looking to drop in come here!
5-star,1,"i am new to crossfit but have an athletic background. i did trials of many different crossfit boxes in gilbert and mesa and was not impressed with the coaching and the competition at the boxes that i tried out. at crossfit phx i have received one on one attention to my form and have gained strength in the two months that i have been attending. additionally, i have constantly pushed by my fellow crossfit athletes as the experience level ranges from beginner to advanced. other details that i noticed and appreciate are: large box, 20 racks and pull up bars, new equipment and plenty of chalk. additionally, although i am not there yet, they have 4 rings from the ceiling and 3 ropes from the ceiling. i am personally greeted by every coach every time i went into to class. they make you feel welcome and valued. i was not sure that crossfit was with the money but crossfit phx is worth it to me."
5-star,1,"me and my wife are from out of town and needed a box to drop in for a workout. so we used the crossfit affiliate tracker and checked out reviews and found phx to be the best one in and the area and after going there and meeting some of the staff we understand now why it's rated so well! the staff was very friendly and helpful, if we're ever back in the area we will absolutely be dropping back in here. i highly recommended this box!"
5-star,1,i was visiting phoenix for the holidays and dropped into this box twice while i was in town. the coaching and community were amazing. everyone was super welcoming and it felt like home. thanks for letting me drop in. this will definitely be my go to place next time i'm in town!!
5-star,1,"this place is a second home to me when i come into town!! mikal is as cool as they come and the other trainers are right in line. the atmosphere is top notch, and with their expansion, the possibilities are endless here! the workouts always kick my azz! i recommend anyone who is looking for a gym to definitely give this place a visit, you wont be disappointed. thanks again to the staff there at crossfit phx, ill see ya guys soon!"
5-star,1,"for mind, body and emotions. this literally refreshes and rejuvenates it all. helped me kick coffee and energy drinks. i'm told it helps kick smoking. treats arthritis and any inflammation you have. this location inside of a cross fit building is the best one in az. i've been to a few others in az, even one closer to my home, this one is my go to spot."
5-star,1,"i spent a lot of time looking at the different boxes in the area, and ultimately decided on crossfit phx due to the wod. and i'm glad i did! as i walked through the door, i was instantly greeted by one of the coaches who led me through the registration process, and the owner greeted me as soon as he was finished with his workout. the layout of the gym impressed me the most. everything was organized and accessible, and there were enough platforms for everyone to work on with plenty of space (my box only has one platform). the owner also ended up teaching my class, and he walked us through the movements of the day, making sure our movements were proper and that we don't hurt ourselves. the actual wod itself was much more intense than the programming that i'm used to, but the community around me definitely helped pushed me to my limits. and after the wod, all the regulars came by one-by-one congratulating me on a good job. i travel regularly to the area for work, and i've found my box that i'll feel comfortable dropping in every time!"
5-star,1,came for a one day drop in and i was treated like i've been a member since they opened! mycal was a great coach and awesome motivator. workout was killer. will definitely come back! they even let me pick the music!
5-star,1,"such a great gym! we came in from out of town to do one of the crossfit open work outs and mycal was super welcoming. he is a fabulous coach and gave us great pointers and advice. all the members were equally welcoming, we will definitely be back the next time we are in pheonix!"
5-star,1,"dropped in for a workout while visiting from ohio. mycal, his staff, the other out of towners and the regulars were all extremely warm and welcoming. as someone who is pretty new to crossfit, this was a very positive and encouraging experience for me. thank you to mycal and everyone at crossfit phx for a great wod and overall fun morning of fitness!"
5-star,1,dropped in from cincinnati this morning. awesome spot! the members were all very friendly and upbeat and got some helpful feedback on lifting form from the coach. he was welcoming from the second i walked in. super easy to find. they also had a great wod programmed for the day. if you're in the area i would definitely recommend stopping in!
5-star,1,"crossfit phx is the best crossfit box that i have ever been to. the coaches are always engaged and encouraging in every person's wod regardless of size of the class. anyone looking for competition will find it at crossfit phx - there is a wide range of skill and experience represented at the gym, but i am never made to feel inferior regardless of my performance on a wod. the gym is clean, well organized, equipped with the latest equipment, and to top it all off has excellent qualified staff. mycal anders, the head coach and owner, is extremely passionate about crossfit, an excellent wod programmer, and takes personal interest in all of the people in his gym. even as one of the youngest crossfitters there - i started when i was 17 - i still have always been treated the same way as the most experienced participants in the gym. if you want to enter a new era of fitness in your life, whether you are a seasoned crossfitter or a newbie, crossfit phx is the place for you! you will not be dissapointed."
5-star,1,"i've been consistently going to classes for a month now. i have not only noticed an incredible change in my body, but an excitement to workout which i hadn't found at many other places. the coaches are down to earth and willing to help at any skill. the environment is welcoming and high energy!"
5-star,1,"let me begin by saying i converted from bodybuilding to crossfit. now that i've been in this crossfit community for a few months i can give an honest review. when i began looking for crossfit boxes to train, i ran across ~15 different locations in the area. what set crossfit phx apart was the website! from a design layout it was amazing! full of information for beginners such as, equipment, shoes, workouts etc. you name it crossfit phx had you covered. so i shot an email to the owner coach mycal anders and received a response in less than 15 minutes! i set up my workout for the next day ready to rock. you can't beat amazing customer service! now let me get into the meat of this review coaches: the coaches here are absolutely amazing! derz, caleb, thatcher, laura, & caitlin are all extremely knowledgeable and caring. they take the time to teach everyone the proper way of doing things instead of throwing you to the wolves. emphasizing technique, form, and safety above all else. this is huge and greatly appreciated. these coaches are the absolute best in the entire valley! community: the community at crossfit phx is fantastic! these people have changed my life and continue to amaze me everyday. so much positivity and energy in this gym! you're constantly surrounded by people who care about your success and improvement. i haven't experienced an atmosphere like this since my high school/college football days. do yourself a favor and drop in, you have to experience it first hand! experience: overall, my experience has far surpassed what i could ever imagine. derz (owner mycal anders) has done a tremendous job in building a family environment at crossfit phx. when crossfit phx says family - intensity -team they mean it! greatest experience of my life! make the choice to raise your standard and come check this place out! connect with me on social media: snapchat: iamjeffthornton periscope: iamjeffthornton | jeff thornton twitter: @iamjeffthornton | twitter.com/iamjeffthornton instagram: @iamjeffthornton | instagram.com/iamjeffthornton facebook: facebook.com/gojefft facebook (like page): facebook.com/iamjeffthornton"
5-star,1,"so there i was, in my mid-30s, feeling a bit past my prime and lacking motivation to get off of the couch for the past couple of years. i was looking for a way to get into great shape but i needed something that would provide structure, motivation and added confidence (coaching!!!) that i was on the right path. i tend to be a bit of a non-conformist by nature and not one to follow the trend -so natually i was skeptical about crossfit which had frequented my facebook newsfeed over the years. then a good friend talked me into giving it a try. now the search was on. i had checked out some other local gyms but they felt a little bit ""commercialized"" and some looked a bit crowded. then i walked into crossfit phx and met head coach mycal anders. this gym just had a different feel about it...a different character that appealed more to me than some of the others...so i gave it a test run, and now i am hooked. initially i was nervous and intimidated; feeling overwhelmed with the thought of the intensity of a crossfit routine. ""what if i get hurt?"" but the outstanding coaching staff and supportive community at crossfit phx calmed my nerves and before i knew it, i am through my first 4 weeks and already feeling a huge improvement in my fitness levels. most importantly, the staff here really focuses on utilizing correct technique and not pushing things too quickly for the beginner. they provide that extra ""individualized"" coaching attention i need that really pushes my comfort level through the roof. like they say, ""check your ego at the door"". i truly buy-in that they can scale and fit the routine to any and all fitness levels whether old or young, big or small. the people who work out here have also been incredibly welcoming, supportive and encouraging. it is like a family. in my opinion there is not a better value for your dollar than crossfit phx for fitness. this place is addicting."
5-star,1,love this gym! i just moved here from jersey and took the last year and half off from crossfit! i was super nervous to go back! the coaches and athletes were so nice and helpful! i'm so happy to be back super stoked to find this gym! thank you!!!!
5-star,1,i have never been to a place with so many knowledgeable trainers and coaches. these guys really focus on technique and ensuring that your gains continue to improve. everyone feels like family here. i recommend this place to all my friends.
5-star,1,"crossfit phx is always growing with the latest in technology to track your workouts and process. mycal anders, head coach and owner, is an extremely passionate and enthusiastic about life and that translates into his programming and coaching. the entire staff and members are extremely welcoming and treat all members of all skill levels as family. coach anders ""derz"" pushes himself and his staff to continue in formal education and certificate not only in crossfit, but also olympic lifting, mobility, yoga, and nutrition. this staff is well organized, personable, and dedicated to ensuring any member who commits to putting in the work gets the results they want to achieve. amazing gym and incredible people to be around. -mike vega"
5-star,1,"first class facility and trainers, methodically sound workouts enabling their athletes to achieve every possible goal. highly recommend this box above all others."
5-star,1,"i dragged my sister into crossfit phx to get her to try it for the first time. mycal was so welcoming as well as the rest of the class. my sister is sold, the facility was excellent, the workout was awesome. i didn't have any of my wraps and stuff, and one of the guys lent them to me. thanks guys!! definently well recommended."
5-star,1,"i recently joined crossfit phx after switching from a box i belonged to for almost a year. from the minute i stepped into the box i was treated like family. the members and staff are so friendly, making your first day, drop in or transition welcoming! what stood out the most to me was the passion the coaches have for what they are doing. whether you're there for a daily workout or training to become a competitive athlete, these coaches are there for you every step of the way. they are incredibly knowledgeable about what they are teaching and demonstrate the drive and support for getting you through the workouts along with running a smooth and organized class! so happy i gave this box and try and would definitely recommend and encourage others to do so!"
5-star,1,"best box in scottsdale! great atmosphere and great coaches. i've been to a few different boxes in the phoenix/scottsdale area, and the level of coaching is by far the best. highly recommend!"
5-star,1,"crossfit phx is a fantastic box! i have been to several crossfit boxes and this is by far one of the best ones i have ever been to. it is very spacious with plenty of equipment for everyone. from rowers, boxes, pull-up bars, ropes, to kettlebells and med balls and jump ropes - they have it all. coach mycal anders knows what he is doing...he challenges you with a great workout, but also makes sure that you have proper form and technique the whole way through. he has an energy that will motivate you to push through the wod, even when you are ready to just throw in the towel. he isn't just ""another crossfit coach""...he has tons of experience in the exercise field, both academically and professionally, which shines through when he coaches. i highly recommend crossfit phx to anyone looking to crossfit, whether you are a rookie or a vet, i promise you will love this place. there is a sense of community that flows throughout, which makes everyone who walks through the door feel welcome. i promise you, by the end of your workout, you will be hooked! i was!!"
5-star,1,"amazing coaching! whether you are a novice or a seasoned athlete you will see results at crossfit phx. i'm not just another member, but rather a part of a community. i actually know other members by name unlike my old gym!"
1-star,0,"canceled my membership in january and as of june i continue to be charged $130 a month. i stopped in there twice and they have ensured it was canceled and would not be charged anymore, however i'm still dealing with this. i have called, text, emailed and not once received a response. the business side is run terribly and not worth your time, go elsewhere."
5-star,1,"ever had your butt kicked in a workout but still managed to keep a smile on your face? me either until i walked into crossfit blur. justin and jake (the owners) have the very best and challenging programming in the valley, as well as the greatest personalities to keep you smiling and laughing throughout your workout! your age doesn't matter and either does your fitness abilities. come check them out and don't let all the abs scare you, everyone is incredibly down to earth and kind! the only reason you would be disappointed is because you didn't give crossfit blur a try sooner!!"
5-star,1,hands down the best workout! jake and justin create a fun/challenging environment. great for all fitness levels. tell them your goals and they will help you achieve them.
5-star,1,"i really didn't want to like crossfit - but i love blur! the coaches are all super supportive and fun. i started in the ""newbies"" class to learn the terminology and movements. they worked with me to scale moves that i couldn't quite do yet and gave me great tips to improve the things i could. i moved up to the regular classes after about a month and though i'm still not doing handstand pushups or anything crazy - i've found i can push myself much harder than i thought with proper coaching. highly recommend, especially to those that think crossfit isn't for them."
5-star,1,great atmosphere. great coaches and members. the work outs are legit and will make you strong af. stop being a lazy f$#k and get your blur booty pump on.
5-star,1,"we have dropped in several times to crossfit blur while we enjoy spring training and time in both scottsdale and tempe. justin, jake, and trevor have always made us feel more than welcome and are extremely accommodating given that every time we seem to drop in it is because we are away from our home gym during the crossfit open and need to do one of the events. they are always more than helpful and are amazing coaches giving us several tips and pointers while attending. i highly recommend either of their locations if you ever find yourself in the scottsdale or tempe area! great gym!!!"
5-star,1,"after two years of doing crossfit, i have never met more knowledgeable, patient, and supportive trainers. no matter your fitness level i would recommend crossfit blur to anyone. for the beginner or the experience you will have a great workout."
5-star,1,justin welcomed us into his box and it felt just like home. great location.. very clean and well laid out. his coaching was awesome and everyone was very friendly. definitely recommend stopping by if you're in the area.
5-star,1,great box ! justin was very welcoming on our visit and the place was clean and well laid out. his coaching was insightful and the wod was challenging! we will definitely be back!
5-star,1,"i've been working out on a one on one basis with jacob, co-owner, and he is truly amazing. i've worked out most my adult life, but i can honestly and still surprisingly say that i have never seen my body change and my strength and endurance increase so much in such a short amount of time. the environment is always a blast, and i always look forward to working out. jake works with our schedules and makes sure to stay on our butts when we are slacking. i've already referred multiple of my friends to this gym, highly recommend it!"
5-star,1,"i was probably like a ton of you out there...mid-30's, married, 2 small kids, high stress career and no real time to exercise. i have a smaller frame so i wasn't fat, but i was absolutely and completely out of shape...hadn't run a mile since hs 20 years ago and found myself checking email more than exercising when i was a member at lifetime fitness. all i knew of crossfit was what memes and cliches told me. then i found blur... justin and jake welcomed me in to the blur family and i've now been going 5x/week for 7 months. i look better, feel better and eat healthier than i ever have in my life. i was never a morning person and now i can't wait to see the 6am crew m-f. justin and jake will guide you to achieve whatever it is that you want out of fitness...they build badass athletes and better people. they achieve this by fostering a culture of camaraderie and commitment, along with elite fitness programming. if you want to find out how strong mentally and physically you can be; come join the blur family. i'm grateful i did..."
5-star,1,"i'm new to the crossfit world, and let me just tell you i was very intimidated but this year i told myself i wanted to join and be a badass! justin welcomed me in and helped me out straight away, i didn't feel out of place (even though i'm definitely a beginner) everyone else in the group was so supportive and helpful, glad i found the perfect gym."
5-star,1,"so i am a mid 40's guy who was kind of lost in the fitness game. i love to weight train and i have done the marathon thing. i was fresh out of residency and in a new town. having let my fitness slip a little during residency i was looking for something different. globo gym stuff was just not exciting me to get fit anymore. my buddy had been doing crossfit for over a year at crossfitblur and told me i should give it a shot. i dropped in one night during a competition and it took me less than 2 seconds to realize crossfit was what i wanted to do. now i'm not writing this to convince you to try crossfit because if you have made it this far you have already decided to give this a shot. i'm 2.5 years deep. every single day is different, exciting and challenging. classes run every hour on the hour from 6am to 7pm with a small mid day 11-1 break. hands down the best schedule in the city. there is not one hour of the day that i don't know a member to crush the workout with. i have never in my life been a part of a group of athletes that push me every day, and i played competitive sports for years. the vibe in this gym is so electric every hour. the coaching you will get from jake and justin (owners and regional qualifying athletes) is unparalleled. i have made personal gains and seen changes in my body by just showing up 3-5 days a week. it's the most addictive environment in any crossfit gym in the city. you will be pushed outside of your comfort zone and it will make you the best version of yourself. we are truly a family and my wife and i spend time with a ton of members outside the gym. i'm in the most ridiculous shape of my life and it's only getting better. i live for this gym! there is no other crossfit gym for me other than crossfit blur. come play, you won't regret it! as we say peace, love, blur"
5-star,1,"after being a part of the blur family for little over 2 years i can truly and honestly say we are a family! there is no other gym like blur the atmosphere is always electric and fun. jake and justin are two of the best coaches and athletes i have ever been around and it rubs off on the rest of the gym. i have been to many gyms around and fallow a lot of them on social media and i can say with full confidence no ones programming is as good as there's. day in and day out they will push you to your personal limits, but also encourage you through it all. i my self joined blur coming off of shoulder surgery, they helped me get my mobility and strength back plus more. as a former baseball player who's carrier was ended due to a injury i never thought i would have that competitive edge again. but blur has showed me that again day in and day out. blur has all ranges of athletes, from former college athletes, to the everyday soccer mom. no matter what your goals are, weather they are to be the to get your competitive drive back or to maybe lose weight. i promise you what ever goal you have they will provide the tools to hit all of them, and you will have a blast doing it! blur is not a just a gym it's a family and a life style!"
5-star,1,"i started off doing a ten-class package, only going on saturdays. i was scared of the hard work commitment and i lived an hour away. jake and justin made me feel so welcome to the pack, along with everyone else. they never singled me out for not fully being a member (or for being a weakling). they always gave me the same attention any member would get. they were great at really coaching me, and scaling things. they were always there to help me get to the next level when i was ready. it's always been about the passion to help people reach their fitness goals than to run a corp. i love that personal feel they bring to our gym. it's been over two years with the blur gang and i can't imagine life without them! i love this place! i have made awesome friends here. honestly, i can't decide if the trainers, the people, or the fitness is my favorite part of blur! the trainers are caring, fun, super savvy, and just have the best personalities ever! if you give this place a try, like i did, you'll never want to leave."
5-star,1,"you will have a lot of fun and you will get fit! the atmosphere of the gym helps and everyone works hard. don't let that scare you though, it's a very nice and caring population of people. they like to have fun with each other and everyone is helpful. they are family and they will welcome you with open arms. give it a try!"
5-star,1,"i can't say enough good things about this place. i am a 48 year old guy who never did crossfit but was intrigued. i joined blur about 8 weeks ago. i quickly learned the difference between thinking that i was in shape and understanding what being in crossfit shape really is. i am not there yet, but i have quickly noticed results. i moved 2 notches on my belt line and have gotten stronger and faster. every class is different which keeps your body guessing and keeps things interesting. blur runs classes every hour on the hour, so i never worry about being late out of work because i know i can jump in the next available class. you don't need to register for a class in advance - just show up and work! i am on the older side for this place, but that said, there are members in there of my vintage and i felt welcome by everyone. jake and justin, the guys who run the place, are knowledgeable and helpful. they are also bring the perfect mix of midwestern niceness and crass juvenile humor to every workout. update - 10/10/15 well, now i have been at it for four months or so, and continue to see positive results. i had to have my dress pants altered because my waistline got smaller. i was going to blur 5-6 times a week, but my body can't handle that as well as i would like, so now i am down to 4 times a week and i swim twice a week. i initially lost about 5 lbs since joining blur, but i put the weight back on in muscle. i recently had my body fat percentage measured, and i am down to 17%. i am getting stronger and faster. i can do kip pull ups, and i can do a few double unders, but i still need to improve on the toes to bar. my speed has improved on runs as well, but i do need to make peace with the fact that i am not going to turn back the clock 20 years. friends have noticed a change in my physique, so hopefully i will be at a point soon that i can have my shirt off at the beach and feel good about myself."
5-star,1,"been going here about a year. as intense as you want it. convenient, classes all day. friendly, knowledgeable trainers and members. energetic classes, fun workouts. well equipped. all you need in a gym."
5-star,1,"how's your plan working for you? your gym: * some corporation in another state that's more interested in your direct deposit than your fitness * people who hog 3 machines/benches at one time; ""dude, i'm super setting!"" * someone resting for 10 minutes on the equipment you want to use * broken equipment for 2+ weeks * people who read magazines/papers on the equipment * people who wear cologne/perfume * the mirror poser * that person who is always talking on their cell phone * that naked dude that's always in the locker room * those scottstitutes... * the cast of jersey shore and real housewives of scottsdale * the 10lbs (actually 15lbs) that you've tried losing for 2.5 years now as many reasons as possible (amrap) to join crossfit blur * awesome trainers who teach and coach at all levels * scheduled classes nearly all day long * new routine daily, never the same old exercises * full body workouts; show off your strengths; work on your weaknesses * average workout time is about 30-40 minutes, but you'll know you worked out! * awesome members that support, encourage, and celebrate your success * build real muscle not steroid puffy * burn fat, lose weight, eat more - look great! * if you decide crossfit is not for you that's cool; all the things you hated about your old gym will be there when you return"
5-star,1,"been here for almost 6 months now and i love it! i tried several other boxes in the area before finding blur and i knew by the end of the first week that i'd be staying at this one. the coaches are great people and really knowledgeable. i'm a big stickler about form, so i definitely wanted to be somewhere where the coaches paid attention to technique and safety, and all of them do at blur. the workouts are definitely challenging, but the coaches are more than willing to scale whatever is needed. everyone has a lot of fun and are very encouraging of each other. awesome gym for anyone from a newbie to a seasoned crossfitter."
5-star,1,"i've been here for over 2 years now and decided to update my review to emphasize the aspects of what makes their gym the best for anybody else looking, rather than just tooting my own ""this is my gym, its the best!"" horn. if you're looking for getting into crossfit or just a fitness plan in general, look no further. the great things this place offers is: - an investment in their members and their gym they constantly put money and effort into providing the gym and its members with new equipment, new setups, supplements, apparel, and cleanliness. they recently took a member survey and genuinely took the input and immediately made some changes to how they run the day to day (all for the better!) - best scheduling around every hour, on the hour. first class at 6am, last class at 7pm (they take a lunch break from (11am-1pm). schedules this flexible and easy to orient and plan around are hard to find. - straightforward pricing with good intro deal it's on their website. they offer an introductory deal so it's low commitment up front if you want to try it out first. after that, no contract and everything is unlimited use. - dedicated trainers/owners the owners are the trainers. they're also the best athletes in the gym, which really goes to prove that their programming is effective and efficient. if you follow crossfit, you can see that the trainers and the gym produces regional level athletes, which is a solid benchmark. - positive and supportive environment whether you're looking to be competitive or just in it to be healthier and look better naked, either way you'll find it here. both the community and the trainers here are supportive of everyone and very fun to be around. beyond all this, i don't know what else you'd need to look for!"
5-star,1,"i looked at a lot of crossfit boxes across the valley. i got the free sessions, and free trials. none of them felt right, either it was too pricey, too limited on classes, or unwelcoming. i finally found crossfit blur through word of mouth. i emailed them, and got the tour. i came in and justin, who gave me the tour, was all smiles. he was patient and friendly, and wasn't pushy. i didn't feel like i was buying a car like at the other boxes. he explained the price, which was among the cheaper prices of the other boxes. there was no contract, and no limit on how many classes you can attend. i worked out there for a week. i got to meet the other owner, jake, who is also all smiles. both are very helpful and help make the new experience less intimidating. 4 months later, my girlfriend and i are both members, and i am down 35lbs and in the best shape of my life. why this gym/box over the others? the owners, the members, and the atmosphere. i feel welcomed, encouraged, and committed. i don't dread waking up and having to workout, i look forward to it."
5-star,1,"crossfit blur is an energy filled environment that kicks your booty into gear! when i initially met the trainers, i felt very comfortable and at ease with my fitness goals in their hands. the gym is unlike global gyms. it has a very open concept and simple equipment. they have little challenges within the gym that really motivate you to workout more in order to achieve your personal fitness goals. i have been a member of la fitness and used to watch all the muscle heads walk around there. crossfit blur peeps are very easy going and everyone is welcoming of new members. we all remember our first day and it's great to see new people come so far doing crossfit. i highly recommend trying the gym out and bring a friend. i have been a member for 7 months now (they've been open for 9) and am not interested in looking anywhere else. they have free classes on saturday! here's their website: http://www.crossfitblur.com/#!home|mainpage like them on facebook! :)"
5-star,1,"i died, came back to life and wanted to do it all over again. and it only took 10 minutes. when i first started with crossfit blur i was completely out of shape. as i've gotten older it's something that's increasingly been on my mind and seemingly harder to do. the thing is, i haven't found something that i can really stick with on a long-term basis at crossfit blur with zero commitment and a free week to see what all the hype was about, how could i not sign up and give it a shot. the gym itself is a big open concrete room with various weights, ropes, and torture devices ... ahem i mean exercise tools. i was nervous, excited and a bit confused since this was all new to me. i was quickly greeted by jake who showed me around and introduced me to people stretching or waiting to start their workout. after a quick warm up session he set up a ""nice' workout for me: 500 m row, 40 squats, 30 push ups, 20 sit ups, and 10 jump pulls ups. sounds easy, right? well by the end my arms were buckling underneath me, my breathing was strangled and i felt like jumping in the air would literally kill me. but then it was over. i laid on the floor too weak to move except to take a few gulps from my water bottle and day one was over. six months later i have become a real crossfit junkie and at this point i can't imagine missing a day. so far i have lost 25 lbs, i am down 4 sizes and have gained endurance, strength, and a family of fellow cross fitters who encourage and really push me to push myself. i'd encourage anyone and everyone to give this a try... the amount of camaraderie and commitment demanded of such a physically grueling program really knocks you out of that boring gym routine and into a world where exercise is exciting. brutal, but exciting. if you are wanting serious results and ready to change your life crossfit blur is the place for you."
5-star,1,"best gym ever. best trainers ever. i have worked out with 5 personal trainers in my life....and these guys are the best. and crossfit workouts are the best workouts out there. i joined because i needed to mix up my routine, get more effective workouts, and not work out with some lame trainer at mountainside or la fitness that just has me do machines while he texts his girlfriend and watches the clock. the trainers at crossfit blur are extremely knowledgeable and actually care about us members .... they are so nice and give everyone tons of personal attention. i love how they make sure our form is perfect and safe.....that is one of the most important things to me! crossfit blur is perfect for people of any fitness level. i am probably the slowest, weakest girl there right now (i am pretty new) but i still love it!! i leave every day feeling like i just had the hardest workout of my life...in a fabulously addicting and good way! every session is different. i totally look forward to going every day. worth every penny."
5-star,1,"shoutout to kate whose an amazing trainer and knows exactly how to push you to your limits. i've been going a few weeks now and i always try to get my sessions with her. she doesn't baby you, which is good, it's what i pay for. i'm a pretty weak person emotionally and physically and cfc is really helping me change that. the student discount is generous too compared to other gyms."
5-star,1,great place to drop in when visiting the toronto area. very friendly staff and coaches. the coaches were very knowledgeable. i was very impressed when they discuss the purpose of the workout and how we could achieve that with modifications and scaling options. definitely would visit again.
5-star,1,"i joined cfc in jan 2013. i was scared at first because of all the stories of the workouts i heard from others. a friend and i signed up for the assessment and met paul the owner and one of the instructors. the space was clean, large with very high ceilings.after the assessment, he showed us a list of prices and told us if we were interested, to drop in any class. no pressure. his classes are from 6am to 7pm- every hour on the hour! basically, when you arrive you do a set to stretches to warm up . then each month,there is a different skill to practice. for example this month is kettle bells. then the evil wod......at midnight, paul's ""dog"" leonidas posts the wod for the next day. i don't recommend reading it. you may not go. so be surprised! anyway, he demonstrates each part of the wod and checks that all participates perform the moves properly. it's either an amrap- as many reps as possible or rft -rounds for time. paul has a great sense of humor, makes you not intimidated even to ask dumb questions and incorporates safety into the routine. finally, you write your name on a whiteboard with your time or # of reps. i'm usually the last one but it doesn't matter. paul encourages individual goals. it's really helped make me stronger. before leaving, we stretch again!! i also like all the other instructors working there, namely irena!"
5-star,1,"i've been going to crossfit colosseum for about 2 years now. i first visited on their 1 year anniversary friends & family bbq. i met a bunch of people who worked out there and spoke enthusiastically about crossfit and its benefits. what struck me was how engaged people were when they spoke about the program and their personal goals. crossfit at crossfit colosseum takes many aspects of your life and rolls it up into a fun lifestyle. they taught me about eating right, and why which food is better for you. i was able to get physical therapy or a sport massage (included in my membership). i was encouraged to take rest days and workout days. and when i workout they push me to my limits, every time. crossfit isn't a day at the spa - you have to be hungry for it. when you do people around you gravitate toward your goals. don't be afraid to ask lots of questions. there is too much to know to think you are going to do it all fast. i love that i can get what i need whenever i need it. the trainers are amazing and paul, the owner, is in regular attendance and ready to help. over these 2 years i've lost 10 belt sizes and feel great physically and mentally. crossfit is a place you can go and forget everything else and just feel the intensity of a fun workout. i'm 42 years old and i never though i'd do things like rope climbing, pull ups, double unders - i didn't think i had it in me. but i chipped away with the guidance of the trainers scaling every workout until i achieved some of my goals. i'm still working at creating and getting goals and i know this process will never end - it's part of what makes going to this gym awesome. i'll tell you what i tell prospective clients that walk through the door looking for information - ""just try it - it's addictive and you'll love it"". i definitely give crossfit colosseum 5 stars."
1-star,0,"i called on a friday to book an intro appointment on sunday. when i showed up, nobody had any record of my appointment (great start!). so i guess they scrambled to accomodate me. the owner/coach was obviously incredibly distracted by whatever else was going on in the gym that day- ran me through the broad strokes of crossfit so quickly that he sounded like the micro machines guy. though he took the time to tell me about his half-marathon time and his own fitness achievements, he didn't ask me one single question about my goals, my fitness experience, my motivations or my expectations. i did my baseline workout (which he was only half watching), and when i finished he told me that he thought i had ""a little left in the tank"", and handed me a sheet of paper with their prices (which are not cheap, btw). he told me he'd email me with a breakdown of my baseline workout, and i've yet to receive anything three days later. there's no doubt that they're serious about fitness there, but i didn't get the feeling that they were serious about my fitness. if this is how they treat a potential client, i don't have high hopes that the treatment will improve once they have my money, so they will not be getting it. i was really excited about trying crossfit before my session on sunday, as i had heard so many good things about it from my friends. i left the session feeling as though i had imposed upon the owner's time and trespassed into his club. i'm still motivated to try crossfit, but i'll be finding somewhere else to invest my time, my sweat and my money. liked: the facility looked impressive disliked: the dismissive treatment i received"
5-star,1,"crossfit is a bit of a cult, but a good cult. for those who haven't tried it, crossfit is a very high intensity form of workout where people work out with a mixture of weights and cardio in a group setting. there a number of crossfit gyms in toronto. i have tried two of them, and, for me, this is the best. as i said, this gym can seem a bit cultish at first. however, there is a real sense of community here, and people are friendly, so if it is a cult, at least the people are nice. for people used to a conventional gym, this can seem a bit offputing: who are these people and why are they talking to me? although it seems a little strange at first, it is worth a try if you live in the area, are hoping to try something different and meet some new people."
5-star,1,"i was a regular here for nearly 2 years before moving overseas. i was new to crossfit before coming, but have tried many other forms of exercise, like boxing, weights, cycling, sports teams, etc. the style of workout a quantum is a nice mix of typical weights, with the punishing (but mercifully short) workout of the day. from my understanding of other gyms i'd say this is more of a ""sport"" crossfit gym than a ""pure"" or traditional one. less emphasis on dangerous lifts with heavy weight, but rather a focus on using your body weight and moving with correct form. it has a very social atmosphere and is very inclusive. simple decore in a rather drab area, but easy to drive to and lots of free parking. bottom line is that you have way more motivation to attend, you work harder, and you have more fun than any other fitness routine i've tried. highly recommended."
5-star,1,"would recommend to anyone regardless of fitness level or experience. i stared coming here 3 years ago with absolutely no past sports or gym/weights experience of any kind. the trainers were amazing at teaching me the proper lifting skills at low weights (empty bar even) to make sure i would learn proper technique first before even thinking about adding weight. there is no ego here, or pressure to do weights or workouts before you are ready for them, from either the coaches or other gym members. everyone is very friendly and supportive and you will see a big range of fitness levels working out side by side and never feel intimidated or embarrassed. the only person i've ever competed with is myself, just working to improve myself every time. i'm the fittest and healthiest i've been in my life and wouldn't consider going anywhere else other than quantum."
5-star,1,"whether you've tried crossfit before and are looking for a new box or you're new to the sport, you should definitely give this ""box"" a try. i've been to several in the city and within north america and these guys really have a good thing going. crossfit has gained a lot of popularity & attention over the last few years. it's an intense and amazing sport combining gymnastics, powerlifting and well, just about anything goes which is why i love it. it's a sport, that if not done correctly, you can injure yourself...like anything else. now that's where quantum crossfit really sets itself apart from the pack. their programs are specific, their coaches pay very close attention to the detail & quality of what you're doing and they can tailor anything you need depending on your performance level, whether you have an injury, etc. the one on one coaching is second to none. their coaches are not only well versed in crossfit specifics but they also know their olympic lifting techniques. what i really appreciated when i first started over a year ago was my first couple of visits were free - to see how i liked the place & for the coaches to have a chance to evaluate my fitness level in order to ensure i had the fundamentals down before getting into the more technical stuff. it is a small facility but i think that's what makes it so brilliant. you really do get a chance to connect with other people and the sense of community is fantastic. crossfit is really all about community so you'll want to pick a place where you feel comfortable. for me, that's quantum crossfit."
1-star,0,"look elsewhere. quantum cancelled my class two hours before i was scheduled to arrive. if i hadn't contacted them, they wouldn't have even told me. if you call them, they never pick up. their ""trainers"" literally don't know how to use email. there are many worthwhile crossfit facilities in the west end of the city. i suggest you look there. also, this review is coming from an actual person who was interested in crossfit -- not by one of their trainers who write very long and very glowing reviews. read the lengthy reviews with a grain of salt. question who wrote them in the first place. good luck finding a facility that can help you reach your fitness goals."
4-star,1,"this was the second box i checked out in search of the ""one"" for me. i forget his name but the young man that was the trainer when i went in was awesome. very attentive, scaled the wod, knowledgable and super friendly. group seemed a bit snarky (had a few women raise eyebrows etc when my tiny 2 year veteren cf-er sister said she didn't need a band for pullups) but overall, it was an enjoyable experience. location was an issue for me, which was why i decided to keep looking :t i would reccomend this box to anyone who didn't fid the location to be an issue :)"
5-star,1,"firstly, crossfit rocks. a fitness routine that incorporates a dynamic range of movements from burpees to pull ups to olympic weightlifting movements to sprinting. it pretty much encapsulates various aspects of fitness and tightly packs it into 1 hr classes. if you're really looking to jump start your health, physique and overall athletic ability, you should look no further than crossfit. hmm i sound a little brainwashed don't i? well try it and you'll get brainwashed too. just to let you a bit of my background pertaining to this, fitness is an important part of my life. i make it mandatory to exercise frequently and a lot of my extra curricular activities are physical (volleyball, dragon boat, adventure racing). i've gone through a whole 90 days with p90x and saw some decent results but i want to push it further and crossfit seemed like a perfect fit. location: what attracted me most was the location of this gym. most of the crossfit gyms are downtown but this one is the only one i've found that is more uptown. that alone, makes this gym a solid choice for those looking to try it out but don't live downtown facilities: like most crossfit gyms, the main elements required empty spaces with pull up bars on the wall, rings hanging from the ceiling, olympic barbells/dumbells, and medicine balls. this gym is not fully equipped like a goodlife with elliptical machines or exercise machines because that's not really what the sport entails. there is one washroom (no shower) and individual change room that are very well maintained. overall, the gym is very clean despite having that garage gym feel which is super cool. you can tell how much a gym owner cares by how well they maintain the facilities and it's pristine(yes, as a crossfit tradition, you're supposed to collapse to the floor after workout and this floor is very clean). it's a bit small in comparison to the likes of crossfitto, but is okay for the average class size (5-8). classes/membership: this gym runs on the instructional class methodology with room for specialized programs once you've become familiar with proper form. like any sport, there are skills that need to be taught properly to avoid injury and ensure proper muscle development. i can't count the number of times i've seen people in the gym lifting big weights but with really bad form. sure, it's an ego thing and i was like that too but no more. having instructional classes allow for injury prevention and proper muscle development. as classes are typically not that large (5-8 people per hour), the trainer is able to assist everyone. classes usually are composed of a strength development component and a metabolic conditioning part (more cardio-esque but with weights sometimes) and last about an hour.(no more of that 2.5 hours at the gym nonsense) everyone tries to motivate each other during the workouts and the trainers are always being vocal and pushing you along. these classes are ideal for those who don't have much time for the gym but want a workout that is short but high intensity. trust me, you don't want to work out anymore after just 1 hr here...unless you're crazy. trainers: couldn't ask for better bunch of people. they pay attention to your specific needs and suggest things. they scale/modify workouts to your own abilities. they provide you with nutritional advice. they are constantly taking courses to better their understanding of fitness and mobility. they definitely challenge you but don't make you feel like you don't belong. the culture fostered in this gym is definitely one where you can make friends and have social gatherings if you feel so inclined. overall: just a great facility overall. as i'll update with a link in the future, this gym was voted best fitness gym in toronto by the now magazine readers! will post link when available. that alone is a statement in itself. please don't be hesitant to try it out because you think you're not fit enough. like i said before, the trainers pay specific attention to everyone and will appropriate workouts according to your own abilities so that you still feel challenged but not pushed over the edge. you have to start somewhere and when you do, this gym will help you see improvements like you've never imagined."
5-star,1,this is a great gym with friendly coaches and members. the workouts are challenging but fun and everyone is very supportive of each other. the facilities and equipment are also excellent. i'd highly recommend this gym. you will feel at home here.
5-star,1,"been crossfitting for three years. finally decided to take the plunge and drop-in to a gym for a workout, while in the road. was able to get two wods in the week that i was there. the facility was too notch, the members were welcoming and i found the coaches (aaron & billy) to be friendly, knowledgeable and very engaging. all the above made for an exceptional experience. this will definitely not be my last visit. if you find yourself in madison and in need a place to throw down, i would definitely recommend crossfit recursive!"
5-star,1,"in town for epic conference and was happy to find cf recursive just a mile from my hotel. nicole was incredibly responsive to email inquires and they make it easy to register for classes. classes span from 530am all the way through 830pm so you can make it work. coaches were fabulous with a lot of explanation, a significant time for mobility, and workouts were challenging. members made me feel at home welcoming me from the second i walked in the door. will definitely be back next time i'm in town for epic. thanks cf recursive for welcoming me!"
5-star,1,"i walked in here two years ago - a woman in my 40s who had never tried crossfit or even had a gym membership before - and immediately felt welcomed. i keep coming back because each time is a challenge, but with constant variety so i never get bored like i used to with my cardio-focused walking/biking/running. i love how i'm always meeting new people here, and at the same time can look forward to seeing my regular morning workout buddies when i come in. all of the coaches have taught me so much - like i never would have tried olympic lifts on my own (and shouldn't!), but with their patient instruction and personalized feedback - even within group sessions - i've actually started to be able to handle some heavier-for-me weights. i've finally increased my upper body strength to where i can now have fun with body weight movements that were an utter chore before (i no longer need to swear under my breath to get through push-ups! i can do rope climbs!). and what's also crucial is that when i'm not feeling 100%, or a movement is just beyond me, it has always been okay to scale back and modify as necessary, or do a lighter weight for that day, and the coaches always respect that and have great advice for how to approach scaling."
5-star,1,"great crossfit gym in madison! i dropped in for a free trial class and it was great. the building is very nice and well-kept. high ceilings and plenty of rig space for pull-up and other forms of torture ;). the trainers were great. vivian lead my class and was super helpful. the programming of the class i attended was very well-rounded with lifting and met-con plus mobility work. the location is great too, within walking distance of the capitol building downtown. lots of restaurants nearby too in case you want to earn some dinner during the wod."
5-star,1,"these guys are great! just started crossfit this week because a group of co-workers of mine swear by it. i can see why they love it! after just three one hour classes i feel better/tighter/more energized. my co-workers and i took class with both nikole and dirk and they were both excellent! being that i am a complete newbie to crossfit they took extra time to explain terminology and how to safely execute every exercise. i was afraid of crossfit before now but i can hardly wait to take my next class! it is challenging but i feel results already!! crossfit combined with a better diet are bound to get me where i want to be with my personal physical fitness goals. i'm a big guy (6 foot 4, 260 lbs) and i managed to survive class! my ultimate goal is to tone back up and trim back down to about 220...i'm confident the combination of exercises & cardio/weight training done in crossfit will get me there. oh - and i am a huge dog lover...it was so much fun having a huge, beautiful, sweet dog greet me when i first walked into the studio! madison is lucky to have this studio here."
5-star,1,"nikole and dirk run a fantastic crossfit gym. it's fun, supportive of whatever your goal is, and it will kick your butt. they have a ton of room to work out, lots of new equipment, and they're just steps from the capital city trail."
5-star,1,"i originally went to crossfit recursive to get into better shape for my wedding and stayed because of the incredible community that dirk and nikole built. when i started i wasn't very strong and had very little knowledge about the movements; however, that didn't matter. the coaches worked with me to make sure that i learned the important points of each lift while also emphasizing the safest way to do it. not only is there a good focus on the correct technique, but there is a always a section of mobility work to help prepare your body for the type of workout you'll be doing that day which further reduces risk of injury. the value placed on safety makes me feel like they truly care for the well-being of their members. on top of all that, i've achieved my goals and have set more that i didn't think i would ever be capable of thanks to the crossfit recursive. there are other boxes that are closer to where i live but i prefer to drive to this one--it's a great gym with awesome members and i highly recommend it.!"
5-star,1,"i dropped in at crossfit recursive in may 2014, and was coached by dirk. i was excited for the workout, which involved tire flips, as my home gym doesn't have the outdoor space for them. dirk was friendly and helpful, as were several other members who went out of their way to introduce themselves. from my brief visit, i got the impression that the community at this gym is tight-knit and a lot of fun."
5-star,1,"easily the best box in the downtown / east side area. the community is very welcoming and the coaching is fantastic. all skill levels are fully represented with a plethora of class options. from running to traditional crossfit to boot camp to oly training, sixth city does it all. adam, cscs head coach, has a very strong ability to make individual connections with members, even in large class scenarios. he has single handedly raised and pushed me to become a better athlete, worker, and overall person, as well as many others. without a good coach and gym, crossfit is just word. sixth city brings everything together in full circle."
5-star,1,"as a runner, i've always been intimidated by crossfit but knew it was something i needed. i really appreciate the kindness and patience the coaches have shown me while i learn all of the ins and outs of all the workouts and movements. i haven't been this sore in a long time. i am getting stronger, more confident, and more fit with each workout."
5-star,1,"my husband and i dropped in during a weekend trip to cleveland. we attended the cityfit class, which was crossfit-esque but without a barbell and more focused on endurance. we loved it and got a great workout! we emailed in advance about dropping in and received a very fast response, which hasn't always been my experience when emailing cf gyms. the gym is nice and big and also super clean! i'd definitely drop in again if we're in town."
5-star,1,"i joined csc about a year ago. because of my job, i never got a chance to consistently workout. sometimes it would be weeks before i drop back into the box. despite that, i saw good results over the year with a couple of prs along the way. i worked with the coaches jeff, adam, and sometimes megan. they were all awesome and attentive! the coaches are always giving me pointers, pushing me for better form and strength, and certainly welcomed my questions. i certainly feel that i have improved in my techniques over the year despite my sporadic visits! their hours are great too. when i moved to cleveland, i looked through many of the boxes' schedules and csc was the one with the latest/earliest classes. program wise, we had a good range of cardio and strength building. they started an endurance class too but i never got to participate in that. overall, i think this gym would be a great place for anyone interested in crossfit, newbies or veterans. while many of the members seems to have done crossfit for some time, the atmosphere and environment are not intimidating for someone new to it. each time i go, i leave as if my entire being has been broken down and reconstructed into something better. it's my therapy session. amusing fact: you can also occasional get a whiff of the coffee being roasted from the company next door."
5-star,1,"i started crossfit almost 4 years ago. i have been members of numerous gyms within the cleveland area and csc is the best box in cleveland. csc has some of the best coaching around. every class starts with a warm-up that includes intentional stretches to focus on the main muscles that will be utilized later in the wod. not all gyms do a great job of warming-up their athletes, but csc places a lot of time on proper warm-ups and cool downs. from their programming, to excellent coaching, to their welcoming community, csc has it all. beautiful and large facility right in the heart of downtown cleveland. if you are looking for a new ""home"" gym in cleveland or looking for a great place to drop-in while out-of-town, crossfit sixth city is your place!"
5-star,1,"i've visited many, many crossfit affiliates throughout the country as a drop-in visitor. crossfit sixth city was certainly the most welcoming and accommodating i've been to. the workout was fun too. definitely stop by if you're in cleveland."
5-star,1,"i moved to cleveland last year. i look for others gyms but crossfit sixth city was the one i choose as my new ""home"". didn't notice but has been more than 4 months i started. coach adam and jeff know what they are talking about, every time you have a question they are ready to answer and help. they can scaled the word or just change the exercise that's right for you. for sure i recommend for everybody! even my husband started crossfit here!"
5-star,1,"i'm in town for work for two weeks and i'm not even a week into my drop-in, but i couldn't wait any longer to share how great a box this is! leading up to my arrival in cleveland, adam was always quick to respond to my emails (both about crossfit but also on his recs on a deep tissue massage therapist in the area, etc.) i've had both jeff and adam as coaches and they are both wonderful. attention to detail, helpful cues that really made sense to me, and good advice about both scaling and mobility. if i were a local to cleveland, this would absolutely be my home box. and aside from the welcoming members and coaches, they have a clean, large facility complete with all the crossfit staples (wall balls, barbells, kbs, dumbbells, plenty of rig space, rowers, airdyne, tons of mobility equipment, bands, towels) and if i've missed something, it's because they have everything and then more--even an inversion table! ha. definitely go here. the area is fine. i'm a white female wearing lululemon and i don't feel in danger when walking to and from downtown. but even so, jeff suggested i cut over to superior to walk and avoid any seediness, which was nice of him. ok. i've raved all over the place now. get thee to crossfit sixth city!"
5-star,1,"awesome box, old school crossfit! great coaching and community. did a really fun wod and got my ass kicked by liz, totally jacked. can't wait to go back."
5-star,1,"i travel a lot for work and am always dropping in various gyms across the country. sixth city is, by far, the best. the trainers know what they're doing. they tailor their coaching to each individual athlete. they care about everyone improving - from the best athlete to the newest member. when i travel it always opens my eyes to how great the members and coaching is at sixth city."
5-star,1,"summary: i've been doing crossfit for a while and i have to say that i love this box as an athlete, a woman, and most importantly, as a customer. personally, i feel safe, i find the trainers to be friendly and engaging, and i experience a great deal of personal growth at this crossfit box. location: i've not once felt unsafe or that my personal property is at risk. cars get broken into all over this city--it's a fact of life out here. i've seen break-ins happen in decent looking cleveland neighborhoods, i've seen it happen a couple blocks up at crossfit cle, i've seen it happen on weekend nights in the warehouse district, and i've seen it happen out in cleveland heights and lakewood. that doesn't mean we're not safe. it means lock your doors and don't leave tempting things out in the open for criminals to see. not just at this location, but everywhere you go in the city. and if something happens, make sure you tell the business owner right away. even so, i've never had my car broken into and i've been here since the day this box opened its doors (i never had a problem when i was a member at cle up the street either). i'm here five to six days a week at various hours and i've never once had a problem with my car or the surrounding public. actually, the people i've encountered on the street are all quite nice and some even cheer us on when we're outside running. hours: the hours are great. many crossfit boxes in the cleveland metro area do not have these kind of hours. i'm able to get a workout in any day of the week regardless of my schedule. i especially like that sundays are essentially free. trainers: the trainers here are great. they are super friendly, hands-on, and engaged in every class i attend. they always help me when i have questions. actually, they even help me when i don't have questions. this crew watches us closely and makes sure we're doing things safe and correctly. they also do a great job and finding weak spots in form and help me fix problems. and when i feel like i need some extra training, they have no problem programming additional work that day for me without any extra cost. i especially love that, on days where i'm not feeling ready to attack a workout full force, they don't let anyone hide in the corner. they make sure everyone is doing their best work each and every time. i love these trainers! programming: i like the change of pace i get through the programming at this box. you get your full hours' worth, that's for sure. we generally run through a strength or olympic lifting session, then we work on accessory movements that help us further improve strength and skills, then we do a wod. a couple days a week we only focus on longer wods. i've seen major improvements over the past six months of this programming. i'm hitting personal records all the time thanks to this programming. extras: once a week a chiropractor/massage therapist drops by to help with the aches and pains a serious athlete might encounter for $20 a session. on sundays, the gym provides $5 yoga. a yoga instructor comes in and we all get a great hour-long yoga session. the gym also runs beach workouts and various activities out in the city as a great way to experience crossfit in a different setting. cost: crossfit isn't cheap, but that's because you receive hands-on training and programming meant to help you see real gains and achieve goals. other gyms might might be cheaper, but if you're not actually seeing any other: i'm a woman and i lift weights via crossfit. i lift heavy weights. i didn't get huge muscles nor do i look like a man. women, i urge you to come to this gym and lift heavy weights and get stronger. you won't get huge/big. you'll get strong and tone. you'll lose body fat and belly flab. you'll have good lean muscle that allow you to eat all the fun foods without gaining fatty weight. lifting weights won't make you some massive man-looking lunk. it takes a ton of work to reach those bodybuilder levels. what we do here will make you feel good and look good!"
5-star,1,"i have been doing crossfit for 3 years and have been to many of the local cle gyms and a few around the country and crossfit sixth city has 3 of the best trainers (1 female and 2 males) around. they are very knowledgeable and go out of their way to teach all the movements and make sure everyone has good form and technique. great gym for non-crossfitters and crossfitters of all levels. the members are all very welcoming and it's a great, fun group of business professionals of all ages. it is one of the bigger gyms in the area with pleanty of room and equipment even w a larger class. multiple bathrooms and showers and it is about 30 seconds off the freeway exit."
5-star,1,"i started doing crossfit three years ago. it's been great. while this is a new gym, the trainers are all quite experienced. and it's more than just a crossfit gym. there's an olympic lifting program too. if you want crossfit, they got it. if you want an oly or strength program, they got it. what i especially like about this crossfit program is that they do more than just the regular workout of the day. there's a big focus on other exercises and movements that ultimately help me get stronger and more capable when handling the workouts. in the end, my favorite thing about crossfit is that it forces me to focus on what my body can do, not what my body looks like. by changing the focus, i'm reaping the benefits in appearance, for sure. crossfit is the only workout program that's actually done something for me. i see real gains both in my strength and endurance, and in how i look and feel. it's also enabled me to be more focused on setting and achieving goals. i love this gym and i would recommend it to anyone, regardless of their ability. shoot, when i started crossfit, i was heavier and i couldn't do much at all in terms of fitness. this place is awesome!"
5-star,1,"i started crossfit 2 years ago. from being a couch potato to working out 3-4 times per week, it's been a big change. it has made a positive difference in my lifestyle, eat healthy, work out regularly. no work out is easy, everyday you leave with your butt being kicked and realizing how much more there is to achieve. the facility is excellent, coaches are well versed in crossfit. the emphasis is on ensuring you do it right. the programming led by jeff, adam & katie is adaptive and helps address your shortcomings. so if you want to get fit, improve your strength & conditioning - crossfit sixth city is the place to be at. i endorse csc without any reservations. addendum: 6/14 csc has added weekly yoga classes. these are held every thursday, led by a certified yoga instructor. i find them very complimentary to crossfit especially with mobility. the yoga classes are open to all & cost $5/session."
1-star,0,"watch out, members. crunch just charged my bank 19.95 instead of the 9.95 i have been paying for years. no permission to do it. notice was posted in the gym!!! i have to sign to get it switched back but they didn't have to get a signature to charge more? check your statements!"
4-star,1,"my only wish would be for another squat rack (they only have one so if someone's on it, you'll end up waiting forever) and better wi-fi. other than that, i love my gym. they have a good selection of machines and multiple sets of free weights around the gym. it's clean and the staff members are friendly."
4-star,1,"can only speak for the lunch-time/mid-day crowd, but it's definitely a great value for what you pay. staff is friendly (so much so that it's clearly a ""rule"" that they acknowledge when you enter/leave), there's always people cleaning, and the equipment is generally in working order. it's small, so sometimes it can be a struggle to get the squat rack or to do bench presses, but that can be said of almost any gym. lots of reviews on here are of the people -- and that's not something the gym can really control. yes, there's some interesting characters at a $10/mo gym in the waterfront, but that doesn't reflect on the facility in any way. i will say there's some questions about some of the gym ""rules."" lots of signs up about no deadlifts if not done on squat rack or smith, but no one seems to enforce it. there have also been many occasions where the shows don't have soap in the dispensers - bring your own, i get it, but it's still an annoyance that's easily fixable"
5-star,1,"i love crunch because it offers me plenty of choices---from free weights to machines to exercise classes all for $25/month. this gym is like a melting pot which is my favorite thing about it; you'll find young, older, beginners, experienced, and so much more here. plus it's conveniently located in the waterfront so it's easy to tack on a shopping or grocery trip before or after hitting the gym."
5-star,1,"i've been to la fitness, i was a member at planet fitness and they were okay, but i'm glad i finally joined crunch. first off, what really made me join is the location. the location is so convenient located right in the waterfront(homestead). i really enjoy coming to crunch, i like the atmosphere of the gym and there are tons of machines to choose from. it's never where i'm waiting around for a machine i want to do. i don't feel judged using this gym and that was a big factor for me. most of the staff is friendly, but some of the staff aren't at all. they are a little standoffish. the manager is super friendly and is who signed me up for my membership. she gave me a ton of guest passes to give to friends/family that wanted to try the gym out. they have 2 or 3 tanning beds and a hydromassage table. there are 3 different types of memberships you can sign up for starting at $10 and goes up to $30. there is a yearly maintenance fee but it still is a great price for a gym membership. they have group classes that you can join in on but that is if you're a second tier membership. overall, crunch is a great gym and i recommend it to everyone!"
1-star,0,"crunch fitness at the water front is the worst gym i've ever been to.the staff and manly manager are the worst.they used to have a great staff and i loved comming there but now it's all new staff and they are terrible.the other day i was not allowed to tan unless i bought a pair of eye were from them.""wow"" in the years i've been going there this is the first time i have ever heard that role."
1-star,0,my entire life i have been very attractive. so when i went to work out in front of a mirror and grunt loudly while i do it i want to see hot girls in yoga pants watch me in amazment. this was not that kind of gym. and ill explain it all from the beginning. i start my rountine buy chugging a monster and redlining my moms honda accord to get the juices flowing. when i walked in this place i was amazed to not see any other fellow brosefs. which i dont mind more gym women for me. the lady at the counter looked more like a librarian than a gym lady. strike one. i normally start with my pecks than abs then chest again and i need 3 machines at once because i crossfit. some little skinny kid tried telling me that i cant sit on my phone and upload pics of me shredding to instagram and not use the machines (little guy doesnt even know crossfit). boy was i not in the mood i told that preteen to eat more protein so that my knuckles wont bleed when i pound his face in. he ran like the girl that i called fat in high school. puny punk boy strike two. my brah chad called me and asked me what i was doing. i told my brah to come spot me lifting. so chad came in but because he wasnt a member he wasnt allowed in. i tried to explain to the librarian that my brah is just gunna spot me. she told me to leave because im sure she was jelly of my abs and because i called her a landwhale. brah thats strike three. i took all my sweat and rubbed in on the all the equipment and went in the bathroom and left an upper decker. last time i go there 1 star
3-star,0,"i love this gym! it's usually never packed and always has the tanning beds open. the one thing i don't really understand is i've been tanning there since i got my membership last year, tonight was the first night an employee asked me about wearing goggles in the bed. i've been tanning here for at least 12 months or more, and i've never been asked that before. she made me pay for eye shields that i don't use or i wouldn't have been able to go in the bed. i just think if that's a rule they should really address it to the other employees that let me go without goggles all the rest of the times i've been here. other than that it's a pretty nice gym."
3-star,0,"i've been a member since this crunch location opened last year. it's fine for cardio and lifting, and i've never had to wait for a machine. i only give it 3 stars because of the lack of class selection (bring back evening barre or early am yoga, please!) but for $10 a month, i'm keeping my membership."
1-star,0,"you get what you pay for!! very cheap, no towels, and staff isn't on top of cleanliness or what is happening in locker rooms. no hot water in women's locker room for months. doesn't compare to the crunch fitness in nyc or florida. classes are very mediocre. owner doesn't care about members...lives out of state. not a wow at all."
5-star,1,"this gym is perfect for those who are intimidated by larger gyms, which are typically busier. you never have to wait to use a machine, and the staff at the front are always very friendly. it's also totally new, which makes it seem much cleaner than other gyms."
4-star,1,"i find this gym meets all my needs, but i don't think it has a wow factor. i gave it an extra star for classes and low price. it's smaller than other gyms and i don't particularly like the layout of it with the classes right in the front with a glass sliding garage-type door. that's just a preference thing and not really a horrible thing on their part. they do have a variety of classes and enough options for the person who is mostly available to attend in the evenings. trx classes and availability of kettlebells are a plus for me. their women's locker room is a good size and has counter space to get ready after a shower. i wish the showers had a bit more privacy to be able to change/get dressed right there after a shower versus out in the open. again, a preference thing. i like how they have a filtered water fountain right outside of the lockers where you can fill up your water bottle. convenient and easy. i haven't had a run-in with any of their staff (like trainers) outside of the front desk individuals who have always been friendly to me. some of the instructors for the classes aren't my favorite in how they conduct their class, but i just try different classes if i don't like an instructor. i will continue to go here out of convenience and price!"
4-star,1,"i like crunch... i've been a member for over three months now. while this was not a prime location for me... it's a bit out of my way. i was looking for 3 things 1 exercise classes, 2 more diverse workout equipment and 3 low price. i signed up after opening specials but before the last deals closed. so i get classes and a base membership for 10$ per month. and roughly 39.99$ in yearly dues for value that really cannot be beat. my old gym didn't offer classes, was over crowded and had some pretty banged up equipment for that same price. i have never had any issues with the front desk staff or class instructors everyone is nice and friendly. it's a pretty clean gym, modern new equipment and holy kettle-bells batman! i was so happy to be able to include a routine with yoga balls, medicine balls and kettle bells. in short equipment wise there is something for everyone here. i do wish there was a bit more space, but you can use the class room when classes are not running for workouts and stretching you just cannot bring outside equipment from elsewhere in the gym into that room. a little sad but there are bosu balls yoga mats, small free weights and trx straps in there. the classes and instructors vary in my opinion, the zumba is very popular and belly butt and thighs boot camp, are tough, so is bosu boot camp. i really like the trx class, yoga is so so. i have tried going different times as there are instructors i prefer that will vary based on your tastes. i have never had a problem with overcrowding here. lots of different types of people working out here also. i was hesitant about this gym due some mixed reviews but after diving into my membership i have no concerns."
1-star,0,"of you are used to the crunches in nyc, prepare to be disappointed. small comparatively and limited services- showers but they don't even offer towels. strength section section very minimal, no wifi, outdated cardio machines that don't work well. i sure hope this gym doesn't cost as much as joining crunch in nyc- not worth more than 30$/month."
5-star,1,"clearly... a gym is necessary for all of my restaurant ventures... lol. i am so glad i became a member. i became a member during their grand opening, so i received my ""peak"" membership for $20 per month. the basic package was offered for $10. the peak includes classes, hydro-massage spa, and tanning (i don't need it, but its nice to know it is there). the staff and trainers are very nice, and willing to offer a helping hand when needed. they offer personal training, supplements/shakes, and other very cool perks. the space is very clean, and i see the staff cleaning the machines often. the gym has all of the amenities for the average gym heads!"
5-star,1,"when i discovered that crunch gym was about to open in the waterfront, i immediately signed up for a membership and cancelled my membership at planet fitness. crunch is much closer to where i live which is a big deal since i don't like to spend a lot of time driving just to go to the gym. initially i thought crunch would comprise of the bottom and top floors of the old filenes basement. however, crunch is on the top floor and a men's clothing store will be on the bottom floor. the gym is actually smaller than other gyms i've been to but it is still spacious and even has a large fitness studio for the various classes that are offered such as pilates and zumba. the women's locker room is nice. it has a grey and purple color scheme going on. there are plenty of lockers, a scale, five bathroom stalls, three showers and an area where there are sinks as well as an extra counter to do your hair and make up. there are no paper towels, only two hand dryers. the only thing i don't like about the locker room is that there are no changing stalls. there are plenty of options available to have a fun and effective workout. if you are a cardio queen or king, there are an estimated 30 treadmills, around a dozen or more elliptical machines, and a handful of stairstep machines. the weightlifting area is my favorite. there are plenty of free weights and weight machines (plate and pin) to tone or build up your muscles. if you prefer to stretch before you work out, there is an area in the front of the facility that provides mats. also in that same area are kettle bells and exercise balls. fitness classes are also offered at crunch. i haven't participated in one yet but retro-tonics sounds fun. to see what classes are being offered and at what time, you can visit crunch's website. i have the peak membership that permits me access to the hydro-massage bed and tanning booths. after my workout i absolutely have to go on the hydro-massage bed. o. m. g. this massage bed is awesome! it's like having a hundred hot tub jet streams massaging your body! you can program the hydro-massage bed to give you a full body massage or to just massage specific areas. the massage lasts for ten minutes. if you decide to use it during peak hours you will have to wait a while as it's quite popular. there are two tanning booths if you prefer to tan instead of waiting for the hydro-massage bed. crunch gym is clean and new and the staff is pleasant. there is a diverse group of people who utilize crunch, which i really like! gym membership is also affordable at $10 for a base membership and $20 for peak. so far i love working out here!"
5-star,1,"this gym just opened last week in the waterfront area in homestead pa. membership signup: my wife and i signed up some time ago before they opened so i assume we got the best deal they'll have. the deal was pretty straight forward. $10 and a $30 once a year fee. if you've ever been a planet fitness member you'll recognize the fee structure. the manager whom we signed up with was pleasent and personable. i lost my little key tag thing between the time i signed up in january and when they opened. they kindly replaced this at no charge. all in all signup was a 5/5. how would i describe this place? it is a hybrid of a gym like planet fitness with lower prices and ""no judgement"" slogans and a more mainstream gym like la fitness as they do have some classes and proper weights but not spinning, sauna or a pool. sadly, this is not a 24 hour gym. which would make it perfect for me. the facility: the facility used to be the top floor of a store i never went into but underwent a complete remodel. it's all new so what can i say other then the space is as good as it will ever be. it is clean and i did see a few staff doing their best to keep it that way already by cleaning. a good sign. the fitness studio for classes is a good sized room. there is an area with kettlebells and weighted balls, an area with cardio machines and the weights area. also i think there is some tanning and some hydrotherapy thing. i don't know about that stuff as i will never use it. the changing rooms are nice and roomy. no paper towels so slobs will have to try harder to make a mess. good idea crunch people. all in all 5/5 the equipment: everything is brand new and works as it should. i did find one treadmill out of level, which if you are walking is no biggie but if you are running it can get pretty annoying. there are no tv's on the cardio equipment, they're handing from the ceiling. they do have a really good mix if stuff. a couple rowers, lots of threadmills, those forever stair things that are great along with elliptical etc. all in all not bad. the weights area looks like they opened a catalog and just ordered one of everything and a few spare flat benches. really this is not a bad strategy at all. the only thing missing is a on old school straight bar pull up bar.bolted to the wall. why gyms refuse to install this $40 piece of equipment i will never get. good variety of weights with dumbells up to 90lbs. no signs reminding people to rerack their weights. 4.5/5 unlevel treadmill on day three of business gets them a minor ding. the staff: the staff i have met have so far been personable and accommodating. i asked for a pilates ball, they showed me where they keep them. i asked that they turn on closed caption on the tv's, they did so. no muss, no fuss so far. also, there isn't at least so far any pushy personal training pitch. really this is a wonder and i hope they keep this up. i don't need it and not being upsold constantly would be a real plus. so far so good. staff gets a 5/5 classes: i'll try one when they get a schedule setup. so far not applicable the other patrons: so far it seems about like a nice mix of just regular folks. it has not been too crowded but i have gone at off peak times. as i go back will update my review. the verdict: for $150 a year if they can keep it clean, the equipment/space from getting to beat up i'd say this place will make a welcomed addition to the area. only time will tell."
5-star,1,"i have been going here for about 10 months now and it's great. the coaches are knowledgeable and very supportive. equipment is all up to date. it's far more expensive than a regular gym but we'll worth it to have workouts programmed for you and caring coaches to make sure you are doing the movements right and scaling things to your appropriate level so you are not injured and can get the most out of your workout. the members are also very friendly and supportive, and they sometimes host workshops on a variety of fitness related topics that i have also found very helpful."
5-star,1,dropped in for a couple sessions while in town on business. great box. great instruction and i really enjoyed it. i try to cleveland often and will make this box my regular stop to stay in shape when traveling.
5-star,1,"great coaches and solid programming. they're always looking for ways to offer programs that suit the needs of their athletes. ctown is the place to go, if you're looking to ditch your boring routine. your mindset will change entirely. i walked in worrying about my physique and now all i care about is getting stronger every single day. it's not a bro fest though, there's people every shape and size. the community is great."
5-star,1,"this review is long overdue. i recently moved to and them from cleveland, spending only nine months in the city. the decision to join ctown was the best thing to happen to me in my time there. i had not done crossfit before and had been a lifelong in and out of the gym kind of guy. never fully committing for longer than a few months at a time. from the minute i walked in and met larry the owner, i knew my life was about to change. ctown focuses on form first and foremost and under the leadership of head coach r.e. has built a solid reputation and family like atmosphere that was more welcoming than i could ever imagine. the group sizes varied, but even at its largest of 15 you still got individualized attention from the coaches throughout the workout. being new, i was worried about not being able to keep up with the workouts, but scalability is also important to ctown. the coaches offered modifications for almost every workout, still pushing you to try and complete it as prescribed. i was only there for a few months, but got into the best shape of my life and was driven by not only the coaches, but my fellow athletes. yes, you do truly feel like an athlete, no matter how you look. there's no egos at ctown, everyone is in it together and you build a great comradery that is driven by the caring personalities of the coaches who drive and inspire you as you go. i met lifelong friends in only a few months, got into the best shape of my life and never felt like i was part of a ""cult"" like atmosphere like some skeptics of crossfit would say. i owe r.e., larry and the team at ctown much gratitude for taking in a new kid in town and turning out a dedicated, more motivated and better individual in the end. if you are thinking of starting crossfit or looking for a new box to join, i could not recommend a better place and better people to be with. whether downtown or in fairview park, ctown is the best in cleveland hands down."
5-star,1,"i started crossfit at ctown west about 9 months ago and it has changed my life in a positive way. i had previously spent the 8 years prior going to a typical fitness gym for strength training and cardio. it eventually became repetitive and mundane, causing me to lose interest. i needed something more challenging and exciting, so i decided to try crossfit. the folks at ctown were immediately helpful in not only explaining crossfit, but also explaining how their club operates. when i signed up, i was welcomed in by all of the coaches as well as the crossfitters. after the initial phase of learning the moves and building the core strength that i did not have from conventional strength training, my confidence began to boost and i started to notice real results. i was sleeping better and had more energy during the day. i also started to shed body fat. also, the coaches at ctown are top notch. they are well-trained, enthusiastic, and generally care about helping you get better and improve. i highly recommend ctown to anyone who wants to get into the best shape of their life in a fun and supportive environment."
5-star,1,"awesome new crossfit box! the coaches here know what they are talking about! they don't care about how heavy you are lifting, they are more concerned about proper form and not hurting yourself, yet still giving it all you got! the community here is unreal. everyone is so friendly!!! you will seriously feel like family when you get here! i know they will be working on getting more class times for the morning, afternoon, and evenings! they will also be getting child care if members will utilize it! i highly urge you to come and check us out!!"
5-star,1,"temporarily closed due to complaints of excessive loud music...? this business was approved to operate in said location and if noise was an issue, the city would not have approved operations there... right? i am confused and disheartened. note - never been here, so giving 5 stars for now because i was really excited to dance zumba here. this would've been the perfect location for me."
5-star,1,fun studio! zumba with eva and marcel are a blast. fun choreography. keeps you sweating...way more fun than running on the treadmill at the gym! prices are extremely reasonable. lots of options depending on how often you plan to take classes. the packages end up working out to less than $5 a class. glad to find this place!
5-star,1,i tried out the zumba class under eva and i must say that eva knows what she is doing. you can see her passion for dance in the way she moves and her facial expressions just give life to it! she is one of the best zumba instructors in vegas
5-star,1,"ez fitness is where they make fitness fun! with amazing instructors and amazing environment, it is the place to be if you want to experience zumba fitness in las vegas! want strength and tone? check out eva's power flow class! a full body workout in only 45 minutes!"
5-star,1,"zumba at ez fitness is no joke! you will bust a hard sweat! amazing cardio workout with the amazing eva! she rocks the party, has fun and gets it in! i love how she invites others on stage and she also gets down and dirty with class when she joins us on the floor! total mi familia style! it's fun and great people! great spirit as soon as you walk in, you definitely feel welcomed. you feel like you are at a club on the strip getting your party on without that snobbishness!!! fun! fun! fun!"
5-star,1,ez fitness the place to be!! i love the classes and the energy the atmosphere and the instructors!!! best workout i've ever actually enjoyed doing and look forward too!!
5-star,1,"i was so excited to see that my favorite zumba fitness instructor opened up her own studio! eva is extremely talented, and makes everyone feel welcome. the studio looks great! love the instagram frame for selfies! mirrors made it feel nice and open, and the flooring was great. there was also plenty of parking, and it was easy to get too, just off the 215. before relocating to las vegas, i was a zumba instructor, and have attended several zin conventions, with instructors from around the world. eva ranks right up there with the very best. she is both an incredible dancer, and an incredible instructor. her non-verbal cues are outstanding, and i find she is extremely easy to follow. her extensive dance background shows through with choreography embracing world music of all genres. whether you are a local, or visiting from out of town, if you take one zumba class this year - make sure it's here!"
5-star,1,zumba with eva is not just an exercise class...:. it's an experience!! you are missing out if you have not been to see her!!!
5-star,1,"you have got to come check out eva at the ez spot. she is the best zumba instructor out there. she is kind, talented beyond belief, and is extremely passionate about life, fitness, and making people happy through dance. the classes are fun, high energy, and are my favorite hour of the day. i have been taking classes with eva for years and she truly is the best. check out the studio, one time you will be hooked!!"
5-star,1,100% best place in town to zumba with the best instructor eva valdes!! i never liked working out until i found her and zumba! it's like a party every class! so much fun. i lost 50 pounds doing zumba and healthy eating. i'm forever grateful to eva for her help! you must check out the ez spot!!
5-star,1,amazing place for zumba!! eva is a great instructor and everyone involved has great energy!! you have to check this place out!! you get a great workout and have fun all at the same time!!! #breathelovedance
5-star,1,such and amazing place with great energy! i've been working out with eva for a few months and of course with some healthy eating i've lost 24lbs! it's always a party and the hr goes by fast which leaves you wanting more! it's a must to come and checkout her studio!!
5-star,1,what an amazing and fun class by eva. i would recommend it to everyone. come and shake it and have fun! and at the same time burn lots of calories. class is over and you leave wanting more. check it out!!
2-star,0,"the staff was very friendly and helpful, but the facilities leave a lot to be desired. everything is cramped and small; there is no indoor pool or hot tub in the ""off season - won't open until april when i'll be going back home to minnesota. the y i go to there has indoor pool, hot tub, and wet sauna open all year, so i was surprised that it is ""too expensive"" to keep an indoor pool and hot tub available here open. even the senior rv resort i'm staying at has an outdoor pool and spa (although small) open year around."
1-star,0,"if i could give 0 stars i would. i have been a ymca member for 5 years in colorado and thought i'd transfer my membership here. from day 1 i've had nothing but problems. they don't return calls at all. ross farnsworth is a great facility if you are single, elderly or can work around their crazy hours. i tried using their childwatch facility but the kids that worked for them have no experience with children. they want to sit on chairs and engage their coworkers not the children. the cardio area half the machines are out of service. the weight area is unattended so people abuse the equipment due to lack of instruction on use. one young man there is incredible, his name is steve. he is the best person in that facility. he will be the only person we miss. i truly hope he goes far in life. avoid this facility at all cost. there are too many options here to settle for meridiocracy."
1-star,0,"i sent my child to camp edwards through the redlands ymca as a cit (counselor in training). while at the camp a staff member provided my child, an underage minor, with alcohol. my child was sent home a day early from camp. i had to drive out to big bear to pick him up from the camp location. after making several inquiries without a response, terry a director for the ymca contacted me 7 days later. i told him a wanted a written report of what transpired with my child and he refused to provide me any information in writing what so ever. it is appalling to me as a teacher that an organization that is so entrenched in our society would allow such a thing to occur and then to flat out refuse to provide us with any information of the situation. i would not recommend anyone to take their child to this ymca. clearly, this is a place where children should never be taken to."
1-star,0,worst summer camp ever! my son was completely miserable and literally still cries if we talk about it. they have extremely poor communication with parents. even when paying $1000 a month to attend they charge an additional $5 for a snowcone but never tell you when its snowcone day so just the kids that always bring money get to enjoy a treat while the other kids watch! they took a field trip to skate-land and i specifically asked about getting my child a walker because he wasn't great at skating. i was told it wasn't necessary to provide extra money because they give them to the ymca kids for free. wrong! my son came home with sore and bruised knees and elbows because he was told it cost extra and he has already spent his money on food and drink. which he also came home with a diet coke they allowed him to purchase there. *he contracted a skin virus from the pool which resulted in a year of dermatology visits and painful removal to stop it from spreading *they charged me twice one week and when they refunded the money it was $10 short and i was told it was a processing fee for the refund of their mistake. the corporate manager was extremely rude about refunding the money and didn't care about any of my complaints. we will never return!
5-star,1,awesome gym for a great family price. also includes great day care right on site for the kiddos while at the gym. pool is also nice when it is open and will be opening on 3/1/2016!
1-star,0,"this review isn't against the facility itself, but is against the organization, business, and insurance provider (the redwood group), mostly against the insurance company. my son was there for a scheduled basketball practice on a monday night about a month ago while a storm was coming through. a mesquite tree had fallen on his car causing quite a bit a damage and broken pieces on his car. after filling out an accident report inside. it was communicated to me that their insurance company (the redwood group) won't cover anything as it was deemed an act of nature. not only was this incident on their property, it was by a mesquite tree planted by the y in their parking. as a matter of fact there were multiple other mesquite trees that had fallen, split or otherwise collapsed. planting this sort of vegetation, that is almost guaranteed to split when there is any amount of rain, is beyond me and should be considered a liability. after spending a substantial amount of money to ymca over the course of 4-5 years for my two boys to play in the competitive basketball league in almost every season, this is horrible way to treat their customers. their insurance company (the redwood group) is now directing the ymca to not even offer to pay a little bit as it would be considered a fault in their business practices. considering my sons car is older, we didn't put comprehensive coverage on it, so we can't even open a claim with our insurance provider. this specific occurance should be considered negligence on the ymca's part for having a tree with a trunk that was growing at a 45 degree angle over the parking lot. in doing research this specific mesquite tree has the softest wood, so when it gets wet, the wood get softer and the leave capture most of the moisture. thus increasing the weight at the top, then it's just a matter of time of when it will split, not if. at this point, just a little consideration from the insurance company (the redwood group) and/or the ymca to help with the damage that incurred on their property would be the right thing to do. again, not only was my son there for a practice the ymca scheduled, otherwise he wouldn't have been there, it was their property, and a by a mesquite tree that wasn't properly maintained. i'm writing this review not becuase i'm looking for a hand out, but am wanting the ymca and the redwood group to take responsibility and do the right thing. especially after all of the money i've paid them for my boys to have memberships there and to play basketball."
3-star,0,"the place itself is pretty clean. not a lot of machine variety. plus the hours are not great because they close pretty early. good for families, but not much else."
4-star,1,"so i've been coming here for about 2.5 years...i decided to join 24 hour fitness to find something that suited my schedule more and i guess its always greener on the other side. ymca blew away the 24 hour fitness i went to in regards to cleanliness, new equipment and availability of equipment. i apologize ymca! i cancelled my 24 hour fitness membership after 72 hours and am now back to the y for good. so what if i can't play basketball here...after tearing my acl/mcl.lateral meniscus here - i think it's time to hang up the laces anyway."
4-star,1,"i like working out here. i go to school right next door, so it's easy to stay a little later after my day is over to work out. at first i didn't like that i would see my schoolmates and it felt awkward, but after going several times and feeling like a regular i'm happy to see people and say hi to them. i guess it was just a confidence thing. i like using the machines - make sure you are engaging the muscles the machine is meant for, engage your abs, and keep your back straight. classes are fun! i tried zumba and boot camp and got a lot out of both of them! as with all gyms, some teachers are better than others so try multiple times that work in your schedule find your favorite!"
4-star,1,"atsu students have membership to the ymca included in our tuition so i'm very grateful for its convenient location right next to campus. it's never too busy, i can always find an open treadmill or elliptical machine (and i go to the y almost everyday, at all times of the day - 5 pm, 7 pm, 8 pm, 9 pm). there's cable tv on every unit, and an ipod charger. they always keep the temperature just right, not too hot nor cold (where it's hard to move your muscles). staff is super friendly too! the classes are great! i've tried yoga (not the best workout, but if you want a relaxing stretching hour, it's great) and body pump (if it's your first body pump class, make sure to use the lightest weights!) the only downside is that on weekends they have limited open hours (12 - 5 pm)."
2-star,0,"if you have a family with a lot of little kids, are absolutely happy with your body, and only want to leave your house to change your scenery, this is your place. if you are looking for a great workout, this is not your place. the hours are pretty bad and you have to plan your schedule around them. the cardio machines are good. the variety of weights is okay but they are all over the place. they have a suggestion box, but they don't take them seriously. the classes used to be good, but now the quality has gone down. the zumba class used to be my favorite, but not so much anymore. they should have different levels, but there is only one and it is slow. there are kids all over the place. i dont understand what parent would want their 6 year old girl learning to shake her butt, but i can't judge, i don't have a kid. maybe when i have one i would want her to learn to dance low and shake it, so she can be asked to go on mtv. the majority of the classes are in the middle of the day, which is great if you dont have a job or anything to do with your time. yoga? there were a couple good instructors, but they are not there anymore. what do you guys do to your instructors? why do they run away? why do you make it hard to get a good workout? i dont think i am asking for much here, just a place that i can get a good workout."
4-star,1,"stressed out? burn off some steam @ the y! the east valley branch is mainly infiltrated with a.t. still students (med, dental, pa, audiology, pt students) since its the building right next door. i've taken cycling classes and yoga classes. i mainly come here for cardio and weight training. the only down fall is that its not open past 10pm, and closes early on weekends. i've posted the hours since i've come here one too many times when it was closed. hours monday - thursday 5:30am to 10:00pm friday 5:30am to 8:00pm saturday 7:00am to 5:00pm sunday 12:00pm to 5:00pm"

5-star,1,"el jefe crossfit is the kind of place that you walk into and immediately feel welcomed. there is an amazing energy through out the gym. they offer so many different options when it comes to your preferred type of workout. whether it be crossfit, power lifting, olympic lifting, strongman, competitor, ocr training, endurance, gymnastics, teen athletics, kids classes, or even yoga, this gym has it all, and has an amazing coach to teach it."
5-star,1,i have been a member here for about 2 weeks and i am loving it so far! there are so many classes to choose from. every coach will push you to be the best athlete that you can be. the other members have been nothing but welcoming and helpful. there's even classes for kids and kid care!
5-star,1,"i started el jefe about a month ago and i was definitely a little intimidated despite having worked out regularly for the last year. however i quickly felt at home from all the amazing el jefe family members. to anyone who has ever wanted to be pushed to the next level or try anything from crossfit, powerlifting, weight training to my favorite strongman and more this is the gym for you! they are not just a crossfit gym but a community of amazing people who really want to help you take it to the next level. stop by and try out a class, you have nothing to lose!"
5-star,1,"el jefe is great environment for working out. the coaches will shape your workout around your physical limitations. after having both my hips replaced, i was concerned about how much i could workout. i am always given options that fit my abilities and still achieve the desired results. during my time at el jefe i have been able to strengthen my joints while increasing my abilities. the staff is always welcoming and encouraging."
1-star,0,"this place is a joke and a half. jovann, or josey, or whatever his name is has no problems playing bs legal games and trying to smear/ruin someone's business and reputation. and simone, will backstab you talk ish behind your back, and do everything she can to undermine you if you don't play along and toe the line. the place is infested with insects, ranging from mosquitoes to scorpions. they have no equipment to offer really, other than cross fit stuff. they kicked our entire crew out based on the lie of that we were stealing or ""poaching"" clients and only gave us a two hour window to move everything. lies, jealousy, and pettiness is what you'll find here. even if you just want to do cross fit, you could do better. i'm honestly surprised they're still in business."
1-star,0,"at first i was excited to be a part of this great community and amazing gym they play out to be. however in time i realized that is not what el jefe is all about. if you seek drama and poor business etiquette, el jefe is right for you. they have no problem being fake to get a dollar, that's for sure. i tried to cancel my membership due to falling on hard times and unable to afford it. the owner would not respond to my emails or requests, purposely ignoring the fact because a 30 day notice was needed. once she responded, instead of understanding, she tried to decrease the package i originally signed up for to keep my membership active after i specifically made it clear that i needed to cancel. same thing happened with many of my other friends who went there. you think they are your friends? after i cancelled, it was like the friendship never existed. the owners are greedy scum and don't care unless you are putting money in their pockets. i will never give el jefe my business and i hope you decide not to also. there are better gyms out there that actually care about their members health and fitness."
5-star,1,"this gym has become my second home! the owners somone & jovan are incredible! they have created something special between the walls of this gym. i started as a 6 week challenger and i now practically live at this gym 3 months later... i have met personal weight loss goals, strength goals, and much much more. stop into el jefe, you won't regret it!"
5-star,1,"this place is all heart. it's more than a typical crossfit, it's family too. the coaches are patient, caring, kind, but also push you to be the best athlete you can be. i'm so glad i made this positive change in my life and meet the jefe family."
5-star,1,el jefe crossfit is the best! this is our second crossfit gym and can't say enough good things about it. the owners are so personable and professional. they treat all of their members with respect. they have so many great classes and coaches it's hard not to spend everyday all day there! programming is awesome and i'm stronger then ever! my husband and boys also go and love it! whether your an elite athlete or a mom looking to stay in shape the coaches at el jefe will help you meet your goals!
5-star,1,"amazing! introduced to el jefe through a friend and fell in love with my first class. if you're looking to challenge yourself this is the place to go. the coaches are encouraging and give you the drive to want to finish the workouts. i've done things i never imagined i was strong enough to do. just started on the journey with them and they have me more than excited for the results. it's truly for any fitness level, they teach you the workouts and work with you. everyone there has been incredible and so nice."
5-star,1,"extremely friendly, knowledgeable coaches who really care about your individual needs and goals. it is a family atmosphere where you will have fun and get in great shape, accomplishing things you may not have thought you could! ! highly recommend!"
5-star,1,"i absolutely love this place! it really is my home away from home! the coaches are the best! it's very rare too find coaches that actually know every members names and makes sure that every single athlete is feeling ok after the workouts. they also make sure that the way we lift is correct too hello keep us from getting injuries! they offer more than just crossfit! they offer weightlifting, powerlifting, strongman and combat training classes. they have it all! when you walk through the doors at el jefe every member welcomes you with open arms! you have to come in and check it out for yourself. you won't regret it!"
5-star,1,"the coaches at el jefe crossfit go above and beyond to meet your health and fitness goals!!! whatever you like to do...weightlifting, powerlifting, strongman, crossfit wods...they have it! all levels of athletes are welcome into this supportive and growth oriented community!!! come on out and give it a try!!!"
5-star,1,"definitely a box that stands out and goes above and beyond! fantastic weightlifting programming, coaching, as well as powerlifting, endurance, and strongman. crossfit classes are never too large and all ""egos"" are checked at the door,great coaching from top to bottom giving everyone a good workout. such an inviting atmosphere and group of people. gym is clean, equipment is fantastic, but the community is what will keep you coming back. best box in the west valley hands down!"
5-star,1,"there is no better gym in the area (or anywhere). the perfect place for athletes of all abilities wanting to improve their fitness and have fun while doing it. the coaches and members create an amazingly supportive environment that keeps people coming back every single day. they also have the best programming of any box i have been to. the first class is free so if you are on the fence about trying crossfit or weightlifting, then you should definitely try out el jefe. you'll be hooked!"
5-star,1,"where to start... the atmosphere is incredible! one of the big reasons my husband and i started crossfit was to experience the community of it. along with getting a great, challenging and safe workout we are supported by a community of fantastic and encouraging people. i always look forward to going to el jefe for the workout but even more so for the el jefe ""family"" the coaching staff is by far the best i've experienced. being a little older then the average crossfitter i have a couple old injuries. the staff modifies my workout so i still get a great workout while being aware not to aggravate an injury. always looking out for our safety :) if you've ever even had a thought to try crossfit this is the place! just the best!"
5-star,1,michael and melissa are very understanding and helpful! i've attended one of their boot camp classes and it definitely kicked my butt! i will definitely be back to learn some krav maga and another boot camp class!
5-star,1,"i was nervous about trying my first krav maga class and thinking of excuses of why i shouldn't go. glad that i didn't back out because everyone here made me feel so welcomed. i plan on staying to learn how to protect my myself and my family. thanks michael and melissa, you guys are awesome!"
5-star,1,"i love this place. mike is a great instructor.. what makes him great is he takes the time for you to see the techniques quickly & in slow motion, will correct you so you're not learning wrong, & emphasizes realism. melissa is great as well, she brings an awesome energy, she also will break things down even more. they both create an amazing environment to learn. highly recommended!!! at least try a free class or $40 for the first month for new students."
5-star,1,"i wanted to learn self-defense and get back into shape so i chose eternity krav maga from a groupon deal i had found. it was definitely the right choice!! the instructors are engaging, friendly, and welcoming to all newcomers, no matter what your fitness level might be. the classes are a great workout, but not super-intimidating for those who might not have previous martial arts experience. from day one i've learned useful techniques that could help me on the street, and have practiced them in a realistic yet safe environment with other students of varying skill level. it's been such a fantastic experience, and i plan on continuing with mike and melissa (super awesome!!!) for as long as i possibly can!!"
5-star,1,"my son attended his first class today. he is 16, so he was in with the adult class. i was extremely impressed with this type of self defense/fighting technique. mike was so great and his wife melissa was step by step with my son making sure he was comfortable with each and every move. bravo eternity krav maga!!! i might start taking the class myself. this is real life self defense training and a real cardio workout in one punch!"
5-star,1,"i've been going here for about two weeks and i can say that i have learned a lot! if self defense is what you're looking for, this is your place! other regular boxing gyms focus more on working out than technique, and karate is too slow paced. this krav maga class however, teaches you self defense moves that you can use in your everyday life! i go here because vegas is a crazy city, so you need to learn how to protect yourself and others. also the people here are friendly and kind, it's like a big family! they also have classes for kids if you want your child to protect yourself in school. i would recommend this to all of my friends!"
5-star,1,mike is such great instructor and his wife melissa is also great as she helps him. they really take their time with the kids and are extremely passionate about krav maga and teaching kids and adults.
5-star,1,krav maga kicks ass! i am obsessed with it! i have been doing krav maga for about 4 months now all with mike here at eternity krav. i have grown so quickly it's like i have been doing it for over a year and most of that credit goes to the excellent instructor mike is. their class sizes are small so every time i go it's like i am getting a personal training season for a fraction of the price! after just a few months i am much more confident in my ability to protect myself and my loved ones. thanks mike and the eternity krav maga team.
1-star,0,"this gym is a disaster. it's dirty and unorganized and the plates and freeweights are scattered across the facility. in all honesty, the weight racks are 75% empty because all dumbbells, barbells and plates are thrown on the floor. i understand this is mainly the result of lazy members, but management should be taking care of it. either hire people to put the weights away or make it clearer to members to put their weights away. i've trained in a number of gyms over the past 10 years and never seen anything like this. you need to budget an extra 15-20 minutes per workout because you're on a scavenger hunt to find a pair of dumbbells."
2-star,0,"worst experience there. first i told them 1 month ahead for cancellation and still charging me for the next 2 month thu my credit card. now i have to travel back 2 times and argue with them. secondly they will upsell you for their personal training and if you say ""no"" they will send you to another person for more up sell. overall very bad experience. will not go back ever again"
5-star,1,"extreme fitness definitely is one of the premier fitness facilities in the city. they have the best in equipment and offer the most variety of clases i have seen. the instructors are amazing in particular alin and/or acky, if you can join in on one of these instructors classes you will be addicted to the high energy, great music classes they both offer and you will be guaranteed results. thornhill has free parking which is a bonus and there's always parking. the gym and change rooms are clean and spacious there's always someone cleaning the halls and common areas. the other bonus is it offers childcare. i would highly recommend this gym. lucy k"
4-star,1,"got to try out this gym with a free guest pass over the weekend. this place is n-i-c-e! from the lobby to the change room to the weight room. you don't really appreciate a clean and sufficient change room until you have been into a dirty and cramped one. the change change room had a little lounge area with a tv and couches, hair drying stations, and a steam room (a little tight though). the training area is really modern so you don't feel like you're in a prison with weights. machines and equipments were sufficient and well spaced. i went on a saturday morning so the place didn't feel crowded. maybe if it was weeknights then i can imagine this place being packed like a sardine can. i give this gym a 4 star based on a free workout and what it is as a gym. i have no clue what the cost is. my only complain is that they treat guest like atm machines and very eager to withdrawal cash from you; they held onto my driving license in front of me until a salesperson came over even after i had asked if i can have my license back. so just be careful you don't get caught up with preaching and pressuring. cheers."
5-star,1,"gym is cozy, spacious and clean. can be crowded depending on the time of the day. monday is the busiest. this gym has two studios that hold two simultaneous classes. it has a huge collection of weights and a good number of benches for weight exercise. it can be intimidating though working out with hard core lifters. there is an estimated of 30 thread mills. ndividual monitors on the thread mill make work out faster (and easier). it's a got a half size salt water pool that is also used for an aquatic class in the afternoon. you'll be with the oldies in this class. members are decent and mostly professionals. sometimes, you will meet students with wealthy parents. class instructors are superb and nice. you'll see cleaners working around the clock to keep the place tidy. the place is huge enough to do floor exercises or lunges almost anywhere. i work out in a lot of extreme fitness locations but this one and richmond branch are my favourites. this is a place where people exercise. if you're unfit, you'll be motivated. as you see men and women with gorgeous body in front of you... you'll tell yourself to keep going... to keep running."
5-star,1,so far i really enjoy this gym... small size and all. the features are just not available at other gyms usually. most of the negative reviews on here seem to be involving their billing department which has nothing to do with this gym at all ....or people flat out not listening or reading any agreement they signed up for. i dont have much to say about trainers..i dont like using them and i dont want them or anyone else to talk to me while i'm there so i will never complain about that lol. i cant comment on the classes cause i dont like group anything and i havent used the cinema but it seems like a cool idea. guess i can only see how it works out here. but it's a gym ...you go and you work out it's pretty cut and dry guys. stop acting like snobs if you want a secluded privileged gym go join david barton over in tivoli and stop complaining about basic gyms lmfao
5-star,1,"i checked out las vegas athletic club before joining eos. it offered the most services for the money actually less and was certainly the cleanest and least crowded. eos also appears to be growing at a rapid pace their locations are popping up very conveniently all over town. same pricing as if you went to planet fitness but so much more it's a real gym. child care is available with video monitoring. nice swimming pool with an attached sauna. big locker rooms clean and bright. i highly recommend eos over the others and its price range. i pay you $20 per month and that includes unlimited classes, the movie theater and use of any location."
1-star,0,horrible! my friend and i walked in and signed a waiver to possibly sign up today and become members. they asked us to take a seat and wait for someone to show us around. we waited for over 20 minutes!!! didn't have the courtesy to let us know how long it would be or anything. we walked up and ask if we can at least see the gym and they said no they can't and we should wait. we couldn't wait any longer. they already they started with poor customer service. they had 4 people working up front and none of them could give us a quick tour. we left!!
5-star,1,"eos on sahara is an awesome gym. shout out to my main man, joseph and the eos crew for helping me find my keys when i dropped them on the stair master. everyone is super nice and helpful."
1-star,0,good luck canceling. they will give you the run around. the manager will not be available ever. does this manager ever work? just when you think the scammy mess is over...bam..you get billed again. then you call the gym...they refer you to some abc financial...no refunds offered..then they tell you only the manager can issue refunds. it is one big loop of mess. 3 billing cycles after i was assured this would be over...guess what...they steal money again from your card...and tell you if you dispute with your bank...collections will get you.. thanks eos for poor customer service..the threat to credit damaged is an excellent businness scam.
1-star,0,i called two months ago to cancel my membership because i'm moving. i kept being charged $5 a month so i made another call today to cancel again. they said they have no record of my call and can't take my word for it. so far i've been charged $10 more then i should have for these past two months with my account on freeze(which was supposed to be canceled in january) now they want to unfreeze my account and make me pay $20 on top of it to be able to cancel. so i have to pay them money to be able to stop paying them. this is ridiculous and i wouldn't recommend starting a membership here unless you are okay with paying hidden fees.
5-star,1,signed up about 3 weeks ago and since day one the experience has been great. i started with tiffany who got me going with the paper work and answered all my questions. she a great front end person for people to have there first inner actions with and get things going. after deciding on the 25 dollar membership i was introduced to sara who is the general manger of the trainers i beleave and she introduced some of the options available to have a trainer which ( was not my intention at all when i went in to sign up) but after to talking with her i decided if i really wanted to make a change in my health and loose the weight and become a healthier person after neglecting my eating habits and lack of any real exercise for years that a trainer is what would get me going as well as mentally have a financial commitment to get me in the gym on a regaular basis. so after the all of the paper work is done i am introduced to stephen who would become my trainer amd i have a conversation with him about getting going. once all that was set up i get ready to explore the gym and sara asks if i would like to try the 530 class with guillermo and if i mind working out with a bunch of women as that's what the class was made up of at that time and i said sure. by the end of the class i thought i was going to die and really realized how out of shape i was in so it was at that point that i decided to go for it and i have tried to be at the gym every morning and every evening for the 5:30 class. i would highly recommend the evening class (also a 930 am class available) which is held by guillermo who does a great job going through the exercises and motivating you to push through. if you're serious about getting in shape take the class and dedicate your time and effort as it does get easier as time goes by and you will start seeing the changes in your health. if a guy like myself weighing 270 lbs can get out there and do it i'm sure there's a lot of other people that can do it as well. if you're curious about the classes grab any of the trainers or hit up sarah or even look for the big dude in the class at 5:30 and i'll tell you about my experience. i would also like to circle back to my trainer stephen who has been great taking the time to go through my sessions making sure that the exercises i am doing i am able to do as well as showing me the proper form and making sure i pushed through the exercises we are doing. all of my other interactions with the other trainers and staff have been great sometimes only very small interactions but not once have any of the staff not taken the time to say hello or answer a couple simple questions that i have. i would recommend stopping in just to check it out.
1-star,0,"horrible horrible place don't waste your time or money here . they could care less about your safety, have unproffesional rude staff and are out for their own financial gain . worst gym ever . corparate is investigating their unproffesional practices conducted at this gym as we speak ."
5-star,1,"absolute favorite gym. i used to be intimidated by the gym, but this gym is so awesome. everyone is so friendly and its clean. for the price i pay i get so many amenities! anyone looking for a great gym please come here"
4-star,1,"this is a great gym with lots of great equipment and tons of amenities. the staff is responsive to your needs. it is constantly being cleaned. not all locations are like this although i've only also seen w lake mead and their layout, equipment and amenities don't compare to w sahara. at sahara there's the best movie theater i've seen outside a regular theater. there's a cycle room, pool, dry sauna, workout classroom, boxing area, and basketball court. i'm sure i've left out some things. it's amazing how this all fits in the area. sometimes it's a bit crowded but you can always find an alternative workout area. the staff is friendly and responsive. the new training supervisor sara is a the only improvement i've been waiting for after a short run by another guy. i have art as my trainer and nobody can beat him."
1-star,0,"it's unfortunate that for my first yelp reviews i'd be writing a negative one to a place i once saw as my second home. everything was cool until i decided to cancel my personal trainer. i trained with art for a year who is amazing and i am very pleased with how much i've learned from him. he really has patience and dedication for those who want to reach their goals. fast forward to about 45 days before my yearly contract is up for pt sessions, around mid-october. i talk to the pt manager who replaces charlie (let's not even go there with him) about canceling my contract, he tells me to write my name and number down and he'd do it for me and to go on with my gym session. i was iffy about leaving after that but decided to trust in that. so the next day i come back to the gym i try looking for him to make sure it's cancelled and i'm told he's taken some days off later to find out he was fired. so i talk to the next guy left to replace him after a few days, mind you i had officially put in my cancellation request before the 30 days or so i thought . the new guy assures me my contract will now be cancelled and i will no longer be charged, last payment being on 11/17. come that day and guess what? i'm charged again for pt sessions. when i speak to them about this, they try telling me that i will only be charged one more time because technically it wasn't entered until 11/2 when the new guy put in my cancellation. i tell them it was put in before with the previous guy who acted unprofessional with just having written my name and number down instead of sitting me down like a contract should be handled. corporate being in on that day, they ""agree"" with refunding me that charge. i wait and wait for the refund and after giving them the benefit of the doubt i decide to call abc financial about 2 weeks after to ask for an update on my refund. lady tells me she doesn't know why i haven't been refunded and tells me to talk to them about issuing me a refund check as there's nothing they can do because ""corporate"" hasn't released the funds. i go in to talk to josh the manager and tell him what i was told and he first tries to tell me they already refunded me. after i tell him i have nothing on my bank statement he calls corporate guy and guy tells him the money is just sitting there in limbo but he would email them to refund me back asap. i tell josh that it's ridiculous i'd have to be waiting for a refund this long which i shouldn't have even been charged in the first place and he tells me that if i would've talked to him sooner i wouldn't be waiting this long but he did his part. right, like this is my fault now for waiting too long. it is now going on 6 weeks and still have not received my refund but if i owed money to them, i bet it wouldn't take 6 weeks for them to come charge me. horrible customer service. once i finally get my refund, if i don't cancel my gym membership altogether, i'll atleast be going to a different location."
5-star,1,i absolutely love this gym!! i have been going to the up (united performance) training for seven months now and angel just started coaching last week!! she is the bomb!! art and guillermo are great as well but angel knows how to really work with us women to target areas that guys wouldn't really think of!! last monday was the booty boot camp and it was a great workout! friday with angel was more cardio which really finished out my week well!! i really enjoy working out and going to the up training especially now that angel will be training two nights out of the week!!
1-star,0,"classes are great here. i wish that the workout room for classes was bigger. there is over 30 people sometimes. the ppl who work there really do not follow up on the gym ""rules"" they just stay up front. i am always cleaning up someone else's sweat and then people in the sauna continue to work out and poor water on the rocks. pool is really gross in my opinion if you really look at it. the cleaning staff does a great job on keeping the gym clean overall as in the floor and locker rooms. this gym can get very crowded with people who are too busy on snapchat or taking selfies, so be ready for that. other than that - if this gym did not have great class instructors like queena, linda and didi, i would cancel my membership. the one star is due to sarah. she came up to me and said i cannot have my bag on the gym floor. that is fine, however everyone else is allowed to? see pics attached. if that is a ""rule"" then it needs to be a ""rule for everyone else, not just me."
5-star,1,"i work out with my fiance and it's always been great. i would recommend the location. oh and if your into workout class this is the place. they have a nice variety, not to mention the children's daycare for parents."
5-star,1,"i train with myk b at eos and love it! using a trainer 2-4 times a week is great. i feel motivated to get toned! he makes sure i'm doing the moves right, and pushes me to do better every time. i see many people at this gym using trainers and i think that's great! thank you, myk!"
5-star,1,"jerome was the one who signed me up and got me started with everything, he's been wonderful! always smiling and extremely knowledgeable on everything. he hooked it up with everything. brian and maurice are the best personal trainers ever!! they really killed it. i can't wait to train with them again (:"
1-star,0,"golds was a great gym, but than eos took over and screwed everything up. now you are just a number and expect to be treated like cattle when you go in there because that's what it feels like. moooooooooooooooooo"
5-star,1,"eos is a great experience of a gym like the eos theatre! and i also like the free weights and the machines they have, friendly staff but sometimes a little moody but everyone has their bad days."
1-star,0,"the worst gym ever!!! dont get a membership of any kind here! save urself that extreme headache and go somewhere else!!!!! seriously! theres no canceling this membership ever! they will keep charging ur card even if u call in and cancel, they do not allow it!"
5-star,1,"very clean and well organized gym nothing to complain about, the layout is perfect as it should be. friendly staff thanks to tiffanne for signing me up great customer service as always."
5-star,1,"i have been a member of eos since opening day at durango, moved to sahara as soon as they opened. the staff here is amazing. christina at the front desk will remember your name and says hello and good bye on every visit. brian the agm is super friendly and always willing to help glad to see he moved from durango to sahara. the trainers are very educated at you can easily find one that meets your needs. my trainer art is crazy smart about fitness ask him anything, rj is motivated and positive and will light that fire in you. get some training and let one of these guys show you the road to success. i've seen it and caught the bug!!!"
5-star,1,i love this location. everyone that works here is very friendly and makes it comfortable to be at a gym environment. i also have my son enrolled in the kids club while i am at the gym and i could not be any happier. the staff is very friendly and it makes me feel comfortable leaving my son there even if it's just for an hour. they seem very interactive with the children and do not shy off from knowing them and their likes. my son sometimes even asks for me to take him to kids club but hey it's a good reason for me to take myself to the gym as well haha. 5 stars for sure.
1-star,0,"my husband and i are the new member here. we go to the gym around midnight and workout. my husband loves dancing so he choose dancing as a cardio workout. today, the front desk guy who named thomas quietly recorded my husband who was dancing and posted to the internet and he was laughing while he posting that record to internet. i guess he found that funny but it is totally not fun at all. i believe no one wants to goto the gym and work out then got record and post to the internet by people who work at the gym. this is unprofessional"
5-star,1,"affordable clean gym! everyone is always super nice and friendly. there's a movie rooms which is pretty cool. alexis made it super easy to sign up, he was really nice. and it was really quick so you can get right to your work out."
5-star,1,"january 5th 2017. new year, new members. it was absolutely crowded today. all equipment was taken except the cardio machines. it was supposed to be leg day, but it's not worth waiting 20 minutes for a machine. no complaints about that though. i appreciate and respect the new members coming out because of their new goals. the boxing was out of order today. so it was definitely a sad day. unsure why, but they better get that done fast considering that's one the pros they have against the durango location. good customer service from front desk, bailey, who was kind enough to my brother's first experience at the gym. i also forgot my towel at home, so josh, the manager, was kind enough to let me borrow one during my work out. i always feel so welcomed being here."
2-star,0,i'm harsh but the truth. be aware!!! they are some thieves in that gym. maybe i was the first one who got hit since the gym open but 3 days ago my lock was broken and black hoody and wallet stolen. again be aware. the problem i have is that management doesn't seem to care much about it or do anything about it. they are also people who use the gym who are not members or on a guest pass that enter unseen. i'm really sorry to write bad review but i really don't feel secure going there anymore. i expected lot more done. so don't bring anything valuable and try to use better locks which still it's no guarantee. now on the good note as far as everything else yes the gym have great equipment not too busy so you get to do your work out in and out. stay safe.
5-star,1,this place is nice! my man gus was awesome getting me in here. i've been to almost all of the eos's but i gotta say this one is the best! it's not too busy like durango and has all new equipment not like stephanie or eastern. i live all the way in henderson but i go straight here from work!
4-star,1,"brand new location and sparkling clean! this location was much needed. even though we live in centennial hills, we are in this area pretty much every day, so stopping in for a quick cardio session for an hour is very convenient. the cinema room at this location is the best of all the eoss. no outside light or sound comes in. it used to be super cold in there, which was great once you worked up a sweat, but walking in with a sweater, then getting hot, then having to stop to take off your sweater was kind of a bit of a pain. now it's much more comfortable in there. there's about 4 ellipticals and one stair machine in the back, then 4 or 5 treadmills, and a front row of about another 5 bikes. it's never too crowded in there that i can't get the machine i want, so that's always good too. they often play newish movies, usually action movies, which are great for keeping your mind off working out especially during chase/fight scenes. the pool is not yet done, but it's getting there. should be a couple more months still. but the rest of the gym is very nice and pretty spacious. i just wish the cross fit area was up against a wall so i could practice handstands, since i can't do them without walls yet. there doesn't seem to be any other good spot for that unless the group class room is open. speaking of the classes, if you're into yoga, try out scott's class on sat at 1pm. it's becoming a pretty popular class now. everytime i see other kinds of classes here, there's about 5 people. last sat there were probably close to 20 people in his class."
1-star,0,"the gym is fine. god help you if you have a problem with their billing. the hoops they will make you jump through will leave you breathless, and don't plan on ever canceling your membership."
5-star,1,"so far so good. this place is clean and the machines are awesome. i hope it stays this way. the pool, i was told, is opening in november. can't wait for that! also, the staff is friendly and professional. highly recommended eos location for customers living in summerlin."
1-star,0,"as a long time member of this gym i surprised the management is ignoring the ventilation of the building. it smells like a arm pit. knowing ventilation requirements, it would appear the outside air intake are closed to save energy. used the gym today and it appears that the outdoor intakes located on the ac system are open again, now provide some fresh air to remove the stale air. thank you"
5-star,1,"shawn bork is a great trainer. i had to start off slow because of my health, now all my girlfriends are surprised at my results and it's only been 3 months!"
1-star,0,"cold hearted snakes. at about the same time they let my trainer shawn bork go i was diagnosed with cancer. i hand delivered a cancellation notice on 4-16-18. they continue to deduct training charges from my bank account. today was the third time! before today's deduction they said they owed me 15 sessions! i told them i had 8 weeks of radiation and didn't know when i could come back for training. warning, $128.00 is a lot more important to them than any clients health or loyalty. i am at my wits end with them. you have been warned."
1-star,0,"i moved out here when this place was still gold's gym and i was member for 4 years prior to that. i got tired of the large crowds that started accumulating and the poor maintenance of the equipment. so i switched over to lifetime fitness, definitely worth the money. one of the sales rep dropped off a few passes at my office. several years have passed and i figured i give them another chance as a secondary gym. the place is still the same old dump. the sales rep wouldn't even allow me to use the pass because of my out of state driver's license. i'm out here on military orders and they still didn't allow it. i'll stick to lifetime and keep la fitness as my secondary."
5-star,1,i've been coming to this gym for just over 6 months and i'm very happy with the value. they are constantly updating equipment and the facilities are nice and clean. it gets busy but it has always been manageable. i've been working with my trainer shawn for the last month and i'm very happy with the results.
5-star,1,"finally found a gym worth going to. the sign up was so easy . right off the bat lauren h. welcomed me with a smile and explained a bit about the gym and then had me registered in about 5 minutes. great customer service, great gym, great prices, just a awesome place all around."
5-star,1,"this is the best gym by far in gilbert/mesa location!!! i've been coming to this location for years, overall the staff and management team are extremely professional and very personable, great equipment, they brought in more cardio equipment which is a plus, the amenities that the gym has to offer are great they have a stocked fridge full of energy drinks, protein drinks, water, gatorade, etc, which is very beneficial to the members as well as staff. the gym is regularly maintained and the cleanliness is above average. the gym members are very friendly and helpful in the gym, as well as the staff that work there, talk about customer service, they are always willing to go out of there way to make the clients feel that they are valued members. if there is any faulty equipment due to malfunctions etc, the staff are usually quick to fix the issue, long story short this gym speaks for itself, you won't regret it."
3-star,0,"started off a little bumpy ironing out the details of my membership and personal training contract, but after working with the pt manager he was able to really help me out. he hooked it up and got me what i wanted with my packages. most of the staff are great with customer service and their pt trainers are all good people ... daycares awesome too, the ladies in there are great and keep it cool handling tons of kids, as far as i can see they clean often and sterilize what they can ..."
1-star,0,"i called tonight to downgrade my boyfriends membership because he pays for the gold plus assuming i was going to be his guest to bring every time and that he would use multiple locations. although he's been paying that price for months now he's never taken advantage of anything other than the weight equipment. with that being explained to the associate noel she told me it would be a $29 downgrade fee. when i explained to her he was never made aware of that and if there were any way to waive that fee, her response was ""we purposely don't tell people about the fee because we don't assume they'll downgrade."" as a paying customer it's not fair to have information withheld from you. when i expressed my feelings about her statement she continued to say ""you have to pay a $29 fee because we are losing money by you downgrading."" as if her rude tone of voice and how she repeatedly cut me off wasn't frustrating enough when i asked for her gm's email she refused to give it to me. she took my number and said he'd call tomorrow. i told her by the way she has been treating me i didn't feel as if she would pass my message along so i really wanted his email and she began to become even more hostile, not to mention that she hung up on me. i work in customer service and i can tell you right now myself nor one of my employees would currently be employed right now if we handled the situation the way noel did. from the reviews i've read it looks as if the manager most likely will not be in contact with me, unfortunate that this is the way i was treated because i needed to change my rates."
5-star,1,"i changed gyms from a different chain because i wanted new and different equipment. i signed up for personal training and have been working with baxter for a few weeks now. he is awesome. he is on it, stern, motivating and pushes me but makes the workout fun! the gym is upgrading all the time and you can't beat the location and price... i highly recommend checking out the training services there!"
4-star,1,"the gym has most of what one needs to get a great workout in. i would like to see some heavy bags though. they have been upgrading the equipment, which is always great to see. overall the staff is polite, however there is one particular personnel who, unfortunately, has the position of kids club manager who is very rude. she has been demeaning on multiple occasions. today she expressed displeasure toward my wife for a yelp review she posted months ago. ""staff are generally nice. kids area is better for under 8 years old as older kids are very bored and the staff are tending to the toddlers."" this young lady acts more like a child with too much makeup when accepting constructive criticism. instead of taking the opportunity to improve the customer experience she wants to demean the customer for their opinion. i hope eos will reconsider her position as she still requires a lot of maturity and professional growth."
3-star,0,"we have repeatedly asked to have the shower curtain fixed in the women's locker room (shower) area-but like the equipment and batteries in the wall clocks -we may have to do it ourselves. so if you are looking to just work out for a economical price-then yes, this is a good gym for that. if you want any amenities (like shower curtains and working clocks)-then no."
5-star,1,"i have been going here about a month or so and i love it! i have recieved help from the trainers and its been awesome! sean and lorenzo are great! on my first day sean took me out for free and made me feel very comfortable. the best part is that i pay them to train me but they don't yell at me. that was always something that was hard to find, i want to be push and encouraged but i don't want to pay someone to yell at me haha definitely happy i found this place!"
5-star,1,"wanting to be more active and fit, i recently joined eos. the location is perfect for me and 24 hour operating hours truly works for my hectic work schedule. not a globo gym and i'm totally ok with that. this gym has everything i need. it can get crowded but i do go at peak times (after work) which is understandable. i receive personal training from kandice and i really didn't expect to see good results in 30 days, but i have! kandice listens to me regarding goals/concerns, gives good advice and she pushes me. i feel motivated and i'm excited to see what progress i make in the next 60 days."
5-star,1,i needed a 24 hour gym at a cheap rate to get my fasted cardio in before work. it's the perfect place to go when i'm restless at night and can't sleep. loving this gym!
1-star,0,"if you go by the pics that the site has on here, that is not what you are getting at the gilbert location. i have been a member for 18 months. i love the classes that i went to but very crowded-hardly room to move. they should have a schedule and limit the size so one isn't bumping into everyone. i wish they'd have more daily classes so they don't have to be crammed to the gills. it's a $10.00 gym. you get what you pay for. you just never know walking in what is going to be working and what isn't. sometimes that means finding an alternative machine that one doesnss't usually use to kill time. it's a little on the rank side. one can tell people are working out. i am not sure if it is the building or the way the air is filtered. it's not too bothersome once one gets used to it, overall. during the evening, there is ""the stroll"" as i like to tease about it. where people just walk around and talk with each other. maybe they are waiting for equipment, maybe they are between sets but i don't get why if one goes to the gym to work out, why are they cruising around chatting. so i just started going straight to the classes and straight out. i decided to go to another gym and that is where my irritation resides with eos. not so much the gym but with the company they hired to handle their membership charges. the gym says to go online (myiclubonline.com) to cancel. i go online but i can't do anything until i register my name/email/phone number along with my contract #. i didn't have my contract # handy. i had to call 888-827-9262 to get my contract number. it won't let me cancel by phone either till i register online. so i register for their website (nothing like giving a company all your new contact info prior to cancelling) and there is nothing about how to cancel a membership on their webpage/no forms,etc. very limited website so not hard to miss. so, i call the initial # and because i am now registered online, it lets me talk to a representative. she will be more than happy to cancel the subscription for $15.00 and i have to pay for one month going forward. i knew about the cancellation fee but not the month going forward. (people never read those contracts---right!!) so it cost me $35.95 to cancel. not too shabby business practice,lol. then she says, ""i am sending you an email regarding the cancellation. i have it on automatic withdrawal and the email says if the payment is not made, the acct will remain active with dues/fee accruing till it is paid in full. why would i be responsible for them not taking the money out. ugggggggg! what a nightmare. and it doesn't seem it is just this gym that has the same policy. going forward,i will make sure that i read how to cancel any membership prior to signing a contract. no company should make stopping their service so complicated. so be forewarned. going to this gym may make you workout more than your body."
5-star,1,"great club with tons of equipment and classes! kevin the manager and staff are always greeting guests with a smile, definitely worth checking out!"
5-star,1,i have been coming to this gym for over 5 years. kevin has been a great guy to get things done and fixed. they will treat you like family at this location.
5-star,1,"i hit up an old buddy from high school named kevin, askin about the gym. after being at la fitness on signal butte for a while i was tired of it there (if anyone goes there or has been i'm sure you understand why) and decided to try eos. kevin wasted no time. gave me a tour, covered every area of the gym but didn't drag it out like some places do. got me signed up quick and easy and made it a great transition. the gym is well kept and has an old school feel which i love. bonus, people actually have gym etiquette and know how to put there stuff away. trainers seem to be real involved with their clients and staff is always awesome!"
4-star,1,"you don't have to be the terminator or the hulk to work out at this gym even though eos formally golds gym is where schwarzenegger and ferrigno got their start! muscle men and women continue to train here but with an affordable monthly fee and friendly staff this gym is for everyone! whether you want slim down with some cardio or grab some weights to pump you up eos has what you need. they offer personal trainers and a variety classes but never try to lay on the muscle to pressure you in. i prefer to work out at night where i can bleed clear without an audience because ladies don't sweat or so i've heard. the ladies work out room is the perfect place for me to do that. when i go in during the day, early evenings & on the weekends the kid's club provides attentive and friendly care for my mini me. i'm always amazed how they manage to know and remember every kid's name. these ladies are keeping a list and checking it twice because the kids all love them & everything is so clean and kept nice! hand sanitizer is provided even though no sick kids are allowed but even the cutest kid can carry hidden ugly germs. so whether you're looking to lose a few pounds, gain some muscle or both eos is open 24/7 to give your body a great workout!"
5-star,1,"the thing about this eos location that i absolutely love is their kids club! i don't feel like just another parent dropping off another child. the staff gets to know me and my child. i feel like they treat my child like their own and i know that she will be well taken care of while i'm working out. as i became a regular they even noticed when i missed a few workouts and asked how things were going because they hadn't seen me in awhile. that speaks the most to me. you can't beat that kind of customer service, it's so personable! and it only costs me $12 a month to add childcare to my account! totally worth it for the level of care my child gets when we go!! i definitely recommend adding it so that you can work out with your mind at ease over the care of you child!"
5-star,1,"i recently joined eos through kevin and already it has become one of my favorite gyms in az. not only is the membership low in cost but you get lots of value. i love the fact that they are open 24/7 making it convenient to work out with my busy schedule. they have a bunch of cardio equipment, weights, classes, personal training, and my personal favorite a ""privacy"" work out room. the staff are always very friendly and knowledgeable. i highly recommend this gym to everyone."
5-star,1,great gym and great manager kevin. always helpful and handles any situation. lots of great equipment and atmosphere. def recommend!
3-star,0,you get what you pay for. membership is $9.99... this location is kind of dirty. trash everywhere and no one re racks their weights also the lighting is rather abrasive. i much prefer the north scottsdale location but this one is closet to my house. i do like that it is 24/7 and the amount of machines and weights they have so that's good.
5-star,1,this place is the place of all places. great gym environment for the common man as well as the advance gym rat. check it out
1-star,0,"i usually go to a different location but work brought me to this part of town. and it has really made me appreciate my regular location because this place is a total shitbox. they had alot more equiment than my regular location, but alot of the benches in the dumbell area had loose pads, all of them, as well as the dumbell racks, had visible rust. the incline benches were the most unergonomic i have ever witnessed, leaving me with a sore lower back. there is alot of new equipment, but just as much equipment looks like its been there since the late 80s. took me a while to find the paper towel dispensers and bleach, and when i did, i noticed the drywall was stained brown with sweat. all around the place was pretty filthy, and if they don't bother with good housekeeping i doubt they do a good job of disinfecting the place. so if staph is your thing, this might be the place for you. the cardio equipment was shoddy, and dated. the fluorescent lighting and muggy atmosphere made it feel like a special kind of limbo. we had a better kept gym in afghanistan, and that was a plywood and brick shack with an 80% chance of mortar fire. i definitely won't be returning unless they go through a massive overhaul."
1-star,0,"horrible!. the place is crap. antiquated machines crowded together. and do not give them any credit card information. in addition to the $10 a month, they charged me $49 to maintain the $10 per month. what? when i tried to cancel my training they told me there is a $50 fee. i thought the signup was for 3 months they have now taken out $74 for 4 months. i cancelled the debit card i gave them but they got around that and still got the money through a loophole. their aim is not to get you in shape, it's to get as much $ from you as possible. be warned."
5-star,1,"trisha at the front desk is awesome! as far as the gym goes i haven't seen much change since it changed from golds, two thumbs up."
1-star,0,"anyone looking for a gym membership should avoid #eosfitness (formerly golds gym) at all costs. they are only there to squeeze money out of you. customer service is horrible and sounds like a bunch of robots regurgitation ""per our policy.."" crap. somehow, i cancel my membership because they don't have a facility in honolulu, and suddenly i am charged a yearly fee. seems a little suspect that i cancel my membership (fully aware i have to give 30 days notice and get charged one more monthly fee) and exactly four days later they charge an annual fee?! highly suspect. been a member over 3 years and this is the appreciation my loyalty is rewarded with, squeezing a few extra dimes outta me. ""there's principalities in this ish smokey!"""
1-star,0,"i wrote the review below for gold's gym but the page redirected me to eos. if this is the same company that ran gold's this is what happened to me: the facility was average but the issue that i had was that they didn't cancel my membership when i called and asked them to. the woman who i spoke to said that i was all set but that was certainly not the case. i used a credit card that i don't use often so i didn't see the reoccurring charges, but eventually rather than calling me about it they sent debt collectors. it was a complete disaster and the only way for me to fight it was to get a lawyer. in the end it was just cheaper to pay them. they are a crooked company so beware!"
5-star,1,"a couple of my friends said that i should attend a free week with them because i have some fitness goals that i would like to reach. i lack motivation when it comes to going to the gym by myself so i figured why not, and i went to try it out for a free week session. today i finished my 8th day in a row and yesterday, without any hesitation, signed up for an unlimited monthly membership. there was no pressure to sign up at all, and while the price tag may be daunting to some people, when you consider everything about this place the price is more than worth it. after just 8 days, one workout per day, i am already seeing results. the trainers here are absolutely amazing. if you are struggling with a work out they will take the time with you to go over how to correctly do it so that you are not hurting yourself but still getting an effective workout with any modifications. i love that the classes are smaller. every member roots for others in the classes and helps motivate them. even if you don't know each other - high fives and ""great jobs"" all around. you don't have to be in amazing shape to start classes here. i sure as heck am not! yes, the workouts are intense, but they get the job done!!!"
5-star,1,"joined the saturday training session! what a great workout! fast, efficient, and fun! abby was the trainer for the morning and she was great. very knowledgeable and motivating! 640 calories burned in 36 minutes! highly recommended!!"
1-star,0,"this is a really tough workout and definitely not designed for everybody or for different fitness levels. in fact, you must be in really good shape and good health to attend a class and do very well with high intensity interval training. just because the workout doesn't seem all that long (forty five minutes on average), the fact is there is very little rest between actual intervals. the intervals last one minute take you from one station (and there were twelve!) to the next with a thirty second rest period which is very little. i thought i would enjoy it and i really didn't. no one from fit36 called me as they said they would to follow up on my first session and this shows how little they really care."
5-star,1,"love the workouts, trainers, music and energy! bryan is so motivating and really helps me with my form . he is willing to make adaptions in the exercise it is too difficult for me. however, all of the trainers are rock stars"
5-star,1,amazing trainers and staff! the workout is different every time and challenging every time- i'm sore for days after one workout ! trainers help modify the moves for you throughout the workout and also come around and help you improve your form. i highly recommend trying a class
5-star,1,"absolutely love this studio! prior to them opening, i heard about a hit interval training class in my area and reached out to learn about class times, rates, trainers, etc. i had done orange theory in the past, so i was familiar with hit classes that used heart monitors to track performance. i've had an absolutely great experience from the very beginning. i worked with nikki and she's been so great in helping me get situated! the trainers are awesome! the majority of my classes have been with asia or brian - love their classes! but really all of the trainers have been great. since the studio is new, the facilities are in beautiful shape. very clean. nothing is there that you aren't using. with 24 people in each class and 12 stations, you're close enough to encourage your neighbor, but far enough to have your space. class times range. starting at 5 am to 6 pm. the workouts can change during the week or you can do two classes in a week that have the same workout. but there are so many variations to each exercise so the ""same workout"" can be completely different classes/experiences. highly recommend this studio!! i'm very excited to see where it goes."
2-star,0,"too many fees after a few months. at first, i didn't think it mattered, but, exercising just 12 inches away from a stranger, is a bit too much. the equipment is crammed together, as if, all of us are friends' or family... glad i choice to end my membership."
5-star,1,i recommend it 100 percent the place is always clean if you are looking for a nice place to work out stop looking this is the right place to start.
1-star,0,"beware of their hidden fees.....after being a member for only 3 months. i was charged an annual fee for each member of my family. $196 to join $19 per month for a family of 4. and just after 3 months of being there, another $76 comes out of my account for an ""annual fee"". plus $19. was told by anthony in an email that it would be returned/refunded!that i needed to wait to receive my check until the following week. went in to pick it up. check wasn't ready until the following day, went in the following day at 9am. i was told to come back at 10. went back i was told there's no check but he felt bad that i wasn't told about the annual fee and wanted to give me $19 cash. i told him to keep his $19. i was charged $76!, plus $19 for the month."
5-star,1,"never busy when i am ready to rock. nice and clean, too. employees are over the top helpful but not all up in your grill while you work out."
5-star,1,great affordable gym with daycare. has pretty much everything you need to train without all the excess that usually costs you more in membership fees. great that it's no contract and i have never seen anything broken. also love that i see other women in the weights area which is not typical with most other gyms. a+ for a no frills get it done workout. staff is always super nice and friendly. we are military so will hate to move when we eventually do because i love it here.
4-star,1,"talk about a relaxed stress free environment. ok, so there's no pool and no locker room, so what. you will never have anything stolen if you don't have a locker room. they do provide lockers but it's right inside the gym. perfect! nobody is hassling you about having a towel or making a little noise. everything in moderation. it is very clean, the equipment is new. i have not seen an out of order sign on anything. friendly staff that greet you by name when you walk in. oh, did i mention the best part? it's the best priced gym you could go to."
1-star,0,"buyer beware !!!!!! i wouldnt recommend this gym, there staff is nothing but teenagers not qualified in sport medicine, the manager doesn't take responsibility for his employees lack of communication . the manager blames his employees. sad, i canceled my membership they went headed and doubled charged my bank acct.which ones again the manager never notified me on the charges . like i said lack of communication, it's run by teenagers. they don't even deserve one, there trainers aren't certified . buyer beware !!!!!"
2-star,0,"not the greatest service. after getting a new job, i was unable to go to the gym again. went in to cancel, had to wait 25 minutes just to speak to the manager. the manager was pushy & tried to offer me deals. i told him i couldn't not due to work. he gave me a gift card to the gym & thanked me. he brought other people to his desk to help.. kind of felt like we were being pushed to leave. i told him i still wanted to cancel!!! he said to call him then in an hour. i did. he answered & said he was with other customers. to check back later. not a horrible gym but the management service however.. thumbs down."
1-star,0,when you ask them for help they give you dirty look no locker rooms day care in gym kids running through gym it's a cheap price that's about it don't waist your money
3-star,0,tough day at the gym. been off my light yoga sequence for 2 weeks and how quickly you realize it takes months to improve flexibility and seconds to lose it. however for the 1st time i conducted my routine at this gym and i have to say they do a decent job of keeping the floors mopped. i've been coming here for couple weeks now and have to say the busy times are hard to determine it is always a surprise whether it will be busy or not. in general for what you are paying i have to say they do an ok job of keeping it clean. the staff is always very nice and friendly. would love to see them add some plyo-boxes.
5-star,1,like i said in my previous review the gym itself was not the issue. the issue i did have has been resolved and i received a full credit of all charges they made to my card. once i received a call from the manager it was handled immediately and i received a check within 2 days.
1-star,0,"gross, gross and gross. although some staff members do take the time to clean the treadmills at times, they ignore everything else and i mean everything else. aside from the obvious; the equipment, take a look at the the floors, walls, mirrors, doors, ceiling fans, ductwork and bathrooms, d-i-s-g-u-s-t-i-n-g. like everyone else who commented, this has been brought to the attention of the owner and he doesn't care. drop a towel on the floor there? pick it up with two fingers, immediately throw it out and then sanitize your hands with bleach. it's a shame because it's close, convenient and the front desk people are nice enough. rule number one in any gym would be cleanliness, rule number two would be cleanliness and rule number three might be a combination of cleanliness and making sure the equipment is in proper working order. i gave it one star because if you have a rock solid immune system this could be the gym for you. if not, wait for the gym on blue diamond and decatur to open next year."
4-star,1,"i've been a gym rat since forever. i recently moved to the area from los angeles. initially, i was skeptical, as the gym is really small. but it is the right size for this community, as it is small as well and not centrally located. the gym has everything you need, machines and free weights. staff is friendly, gym is clean, and people who work out there seem to be drama free. there are just a few things that annoy me or would have been better: 1. a great deal of time, the men's room is out of paper towels. i think the staff should check that much more often and/or install an electrical hand dryer as well. 2. there are no showers there (i personally don't mind but some people may). there are changing rooms though. 3. there isn't a dedicated stretching/warmup area. overall, for the price (i got $9.99 special) a month (plus yearly fee), it is good value."
1-star,0,so accommodating when you signing up ! different story when you want to cancel the membership ! you can sign up from any location but u have to. cancel from where you signed up . you don't need a manager to sign up but you do when you want to stop!
5-star,1,"this place is great. home away from home. it's small, but never stopped me from doing what i'm doing. employees are friendly, and machines that are broken are fixed within a day. i've been a member of gold's and 24 hour, and this place is just as good. not a ringing endorsement...? for $10 a month, waaaaaay better than the other two."
5-star,1,"best price around, not for people looking to stare at people while they're working out and more actual working out. has everything you need if you're going to the gym to build. does not have a starbucks on site or a powder room for you little girls. very nicely located in the heart of southern highland's. great staff!"
1-star,0,by far the filthiest gym environment i've ever been in the equipment hasn't been wiped off in years and the high dusting is so thick and full of contaminants it's ridiculous for a place where people go to to try to get healthy to be put in a position to breathe such filthy air is just plain irresponsible i've brought it to the attention of management on more than one occasion and it falls on deaf ears owners in upper management should be ashamed of themselves there is no excuse for how bad it is i get that it's a low-cost alternative but there's no excuse for filthy
4-star,1,"i've been going to lvac for 4 years, but i recently signed up here because it's closer to my house. it's got everything a gym should have: free weights, diverse machines, cardio equipment, core training accessories, trx station, and more. it's somewhat small, but it's never too crowded. it can be a little busy at times, but most people are friendly and will let you work in or take note that you're waiting for equipment, as well. the only downside is that there's a lack of multiple pieces of the same equipment. i'll never give a gym 5 stars if they only have one squat rack."
5-star,1,this is a perfect little gym. they have plenty of equipment and it's well maintained and clean. if your looking for a super sized meat market of a gym this is not for you. if you want to work out among lots of motivated people this is the gym for you!! the staff is really friendly here and they keep the gym clean. they also have a kids area but no space for classes like yoga or spin but still a great gym!!
1-star,0,terrible hours and way too small and therefore too busy. the opening hours are just ridiculous. can't wait for another gym to open in this area.
5-star,1,"no matter what everyone says, if you want a gym that nobody will bother you and stare at you, this is the spot. i'm there every monday thru friday at 445am and it's great. i'll admit in the afternoon like 5pm to 7pm it gets packed. but that tells you it's good place to go to. i have a personal trainer, ana. she's been with me since day 1 of me starting here at the gym. this is actually my 1st time signing up for a membership. i've searched other place in town but they're either way too big, people are way too loud or in some cases staring at you. i highly recommend this place. go see ana, cody, tom or brody if you want a difference in your life. act now! seriously"
5-star,1,"i really like this gym and they recently added the stair mill which is awesome! my husband and i both work part time in order to be home with our son. this gym is in our budget and has free daycare. they are great at the daycare, it's very clean in there and they carried my son almost every time for a month until he got used to it. all the staff is great, it is small but you can't beat it for the price. i've lost 25lbs so far thanks to this gym."
2-star,0,this is absolutely the dirtiest gym i've ever been in. it's always crowded and no one re racks their weights. the only reason for the 2 stars is the price but the longer i come the more i want to change because it's just so dirty
5-star,1,"this is an amazing place. i have been going since october 2015, and love it. i have a trainer named joe (evenings) and he is the best. i am a very large woman and because of him i have dropped 80 pounds and still going. can not say enough great things about joe and the gym. tom the manager is outstanding as well."
1-star,0,"i called in for membership information and all the kid kept on saying if ""we can give you information over the phone, management has instructed us to have membership conversation over the phone"" are you *^&ing kidding!!!. wake up!!! like i really want to spend an hour onsite going over membership. stupid policy. i was a member for 3 yr as i live 3 miles away from the gym, but i didn't review after i saw how unprofessional the staff was. guess the owner should go back to st. louis and refresh on customer service !"
2-star,0,"it's a little below average. machines sometimes broke for over a week, and you deal with stuck up baller on budget people from southern highlands."
5-star,1,i really enjoy this gym. it's close to my house and the staff is very friendly. it's a little bit small but they do have a childcare center which is a must for me. joe is my trainer and he's amazing! he pushes me and even developed a meal plan for me. i highly recommend him as a personal trainer.
1-star,0,"small, overcrowded gym. good luck using a bench or the single squat rack. extremely rude staff. i moved to another state and they wouldn't let me cancel over the phone. avoid this hole in the wall at all costs."
1-star,0,while the location is convenient and the staff is friendly....the place is disgustingly filthy. i have been in sporadically over the past year and every time i hope for improvement but to be honest it just grosses me out. as nice as the staff is....they are lazy and should always be up and cleaning something....anything....i beg of you!
2-star,0,"pros: awesome people at the front desk. i am back in town for two months and needed a gym near by. they gave me a lower price than what they quoted me on the phone without me even asking. cons: way too crowded. i really don't even have the words to explain how packed the place was. while i got a great deal, i just can't come back here. there are so many machines packed into this space that you can barely move around (which is my fault for not looking around before signing up, but still). no room whatsoever around the free weights to do any type of organized circuit because you are constantly moving out of the way and avoiding other people two inches from you. maybe the issue was because i went at 6:00pm when everyone was getting off work, but there were so many people in that gym i couldn't even enjoy my workout. i'm sure it's not as packed early in the morning, but that just won't work for me. so i'll be eating my fee i paid for the two months and going elsewhere. bummer."
5-star,1,"i love this gym! it's so convenient and close to other stores i frequent often. the boys that work their are so cute and friendly and remember me when i come in. it never gets to busy and i always am able to use the machines i want. they don't have a locker room - but for $10/month i can't complain! it's always very clean and i often see the boys vaccuuming and cleaning the machines. if you need a gym to get busy in and not get distracted, this is the one for you!"
4-star,1,not the biggest place to workout but i'm not trying to become ahhnold either. it is quite cramped with all the equipment they have jammed in there but some kind of workout is better than no workout.
3-star,0,"i love this gym for the ease of closeness, it's cleanliness and the bare essentials is has when i don't feel like making the trek all the way out to gv where my other gym is. this is great when you don't have much time and you need to get a quick work out in. bare minimal gym for the serious trainer. the staff is also super friendly which keeps me coming back. i bought some training sessions but they were pretty worthless as i believe just about anyone could get certified and i didn't even break a sweat i let my last session just go because it was a waste of my time. again, if you live in the area there are no contracts and monthy fees from 5-10 a month. can't beat that. they don't have a stair master though which is why i have this a 3 review."
5-star,1,i go to this gym 6 days a week at 5am and i have also started going in the evenings as well at about 5-6pm it is pretty busy in the evening and you just need to get in where you fit in and get the workout you want and get out. in the morning you can pretty much move about freely and get your workout in pretty quickly before taking off. i like that it is a smaller gym and the morning crew is usually always the same people so you get used to who is there and they are all very conscious of etiquette and don't just take over a machine you are working on. the last but obvious key to this place is the price. it is cheap.. if you are wanting to get in shape and not break the bank just skip 2 lunches at mcdonald's this month and your dues are paid.
4-star,1,"it's a good neighborhood gym. great for quick workouts. the staff is friendly and they are readily to assist clients with any questions. the facility has lockers, a children's playroom, a cardio section, a range of machines, and free weights. defiantly recommend for all ages (well 13&up)."
4-star,1,"i have only been to fitness 19 a few times but so far so good... one thing they forgot to tell me before signing up is the kids play room closes from 2-4... so i was a little bummed when i showed up there at 2:30 to work out, the guy that signed me up only said the kids play room was only closed on sundays. its a really good deal and its super close to my house. they only have the basic work out equipment, nothing fancy and no pool or sauna, but i never use that stuff anyways!!"
4-star,1,"for the monthly price, well worth it. lots of renovation has happened since i last came here, which is awesome. they have added new equipment since i last came here and lockers too. i was particularly looking for more leg equipment which they now have, bonus! it isn't the fanciest of equipment, but it gets the job done. its the nearest gym facility in the southwest area, so it is a pretty busy gym. i've been here early am and late pm, and yup, still fairly busy. the gym etiquette here is good. meaning, for the most part, people re-rack the weights, will ask if your done with the equipment, etc. that's almost hard to come by. it would be nice if they had some sanitizing wipes or something to spray down when people are done using the equipment, a suggestion i hope that will be implemented :)"
2-star,0,"small, just small. no space on the floor to do non equipment workouts, closes early on weekends, not humid enough, i felt that painful cold air in my throat as i ran. not enough space in the free weights section...maybe its because i'm used to 24 hour fitness, but my workout didn't feel complete since i didn't get to relax my muscles in the sauna afterward."
4-star,1,this fitness 19 is a family operated gym! staff is really nice and the owner is friendly and knowledgeable. i dont go often cause i workout at the henderson fitness 19 gym. keep up the good work
5-star,1,"for a local gym fitness 19 is as good as it gets. very friendly staff starts with the owner tom who makes you feel welcome as soon as you walk in. even during peak times it isn't packed... only draw back is no sauna or steam room and very little locker space or changing area. but on the upside, it is very relaxed and several times i have lost gloves/headphones/ipod and everytime they are returned to the lost and found. great neighborhood place!"
5-star,1,"bob lachniet, principal of the aforementioned retailer, is to be commended for his dedication to service and fair play. confronted with an obstinate factory rep, bob resolved the factory defect at his own cost. i have made three major purchases from bob, all to my complete satisfaction. stellar retailer..."
5-star,1,"highly recommended, jack provided great service and a great price. jack even followed up several times to make sure there were no problems with the equipment. probably the best service we ever received buying fitness equipment."
5-star,1,"my husband and i are very satisfied customers of fitness 4 home. all of our work-out equipment comes from fitness 4 home, and we attribute our success in staying fit in great part to the excellent advice provided by manager, jack hinshaw, who helped us select the appropriate equipment to meet our needs. gene severino, m.d. and carol scarafiotti"
5-star,1,"super service from jack at this store. i got a solid deal, and the equipment recommendations have been terrific. the home gym i now have is better than a health club! much better than the on line options in my opinion- i get piece of mind knowing that if i need adjustment, maintenance, etc it's down the street."
5-star,1,"great, knowledgable and organized staff, outstanding inventory, good prices. purchased a nice package from them after another store was out of stock (a store which i only originally chose over this just because it was closer to work). to my surprise, they had plenty in stock at the set price the particular brand sells for. i was mainly helped by eric, who is very knowledgable and customer-service oriented."
5-star,1,"after many trips to fitness4home in scottsdale i purchased the true m30. i was extremely pleased with how kevin treated my family and me. each time we stopped in he was very patient, helpful, and informative. the delivery and set up of my new machine went very smoothly. i love my m30 and because of the fantastic service i received from kevin i would definitely send all of my friends to him."
1-star,0,"terrible, terrible.. i'm not even picky about my gym but the managers or just management is crap. no customer service skills. i've been having problems with my account and of course getting the run around every month."
4-star,1,"it's not a perfect gym, but it's a great value if you get in during one of their many promo periods. the amenities are limited and the gym space is a bit cramped, but the location is great and the staff is good. if you're looking for fancy toys and to be seen, this isn't the place for you. if you want to get in and out for a workout close to home or the office for an affordable monthly rate, head here."
4-star,1,"not really sure what people are fussing about. it's a great gym. it has all the basics you need and a friendly staff. if you want a pool and a lot of hype go to the ymca...for a higher $ too. equipment is fine...newer than older. i hear the classes are nice. tanning, showers, trainers...etc. could use a facelift (lorckerrooms included) but other than that no complaints."
1-star,0,"i used to love this gym until they started charging me for duplicate memberships. when you try to cancel they give you they run around between gym management and outside billing company (abc financial). i've been back and forth for months, they say they will cancel membership then a charge shows up the next month. i've spent more time tracking down managers and billing agents then i ever did at the gym. go anywhere else but to fitness connection. complete let down!"
1-star,0,"this club truly needs a facelift! everything is old and outdated. i've visited their clubs in other areas, an this seems to be the worst one!"
2-star,0,"unfortunately i was not really impressed with fitness connection, at least this one in particular. the one pro i did find were the classes that they offered. during my 5 day free pass that i only utilized 2 days of, i tried the body pump class and the cardio kickboxing class, both of which were awesome and had great instructors. they offered a few other classes that i didn't get the chance to try out but seemed like they would have been awesome too. so i signed up for the five day free pass and i was really excited because it's so close to my apartment and of course, because of the classes! but unfortunately this was more of a bother than a convenience. on the first day that i used the pass i had to fill something out real quick, not a big deal. i was then immediately asked to talk to someone after i was done with my class since i didn't have time before. i thought this was a little aggressive considering it was my first time here and first day using the pass so after class i didn't see the guy who waned to talk to me about membership and didn't have time to wait around. the next morning i received a phone call from the same guy asking me when i'd be in next, what day/time, class everything and if i could talk before or after. i said after. again after didn't see anyone and wasn't waiting. at this rate i was already annoyed since they were being so aggressive and i barely used two days of my pass so i really didn't even get to experience a lot of the gym yet to make a decision on whether or not i wanted a membership. so after the second day i started receiving texts, phone calls, and emails about speaking to someone about the membership. i answered some i didn't answer others and i made it pretty clear that i would think about it and get back to them, and continued to get contacted. after the second day, i stopped going to fitness connection because of how clear i made it that i would think about it yet they continued to contact me. this is now at least a week later and i got another phone call today about extending my five day membership to seven days, i said i'm ok thanks and the person on the phone laughed and said ok with what? again i think it's pretty clear that i was saying thanks but no thanks. i'm sorry but too in my face about a membership before even being able to feel it out for the first 5 days. on top of that, just wasn't my scene. it was a big, little gym. there is a lot of equipment stuffed into the gym, kind of on top of each other. too close to one another for my liking. i'll stick to the gym in my apartment complex and the current gym i have a membership with."
3-star,0,"about what you would expect. they are slowly improving, but ramping up memberships exponentially at the same time. very crowded during peak times, but to be expected. the bigger issue is attention to detail: their are almost no ab balls, and the ones which do exist are either flat or being used in the ""personal training only areas"". jump ropes disappear, not enough cable machine carabiners to attach all of the cables to pull handles at one time, etc. small gym staples which are cheap to purchase and should be monitored and maintained."
2-star,0,"good for a basic work out. i work out 1st thing in the am and never have to wait for an elliptical, bike, or stair climber. it gets the workout covered. however, this place needs to clean up their facilities. the shower, restrooms, and changing rooms are not regularly cleaned. you can come every weekday and see the same mark on a shower stall, piece, hair on the floor, etc..for days on end. ugh! gross! wear your shower shoes and bring scrubbing bubbles with you. cause this cheap place ain t cleaning up. mrsa, vre, and athletes foot love this place."
1-star,0,"fitness connection has been a terrible experience. i was only a member for 1 month and in that time frame came a great load of disappointments. none of the staff seemed to every know what was going on. upon signing up, we were told there were bootcamp classes there three times a week when come to find out bootcamp is actually offered once a week at the location. i was consistently misinformed by staff about policies and procedures clearly they knew nothing about including services offered, cancelation policy, and how to actually go about canceling your account. i tried to cancel my policy within the 30 days notice and was told i had to come in to cancel when in fact was informed by the billing company that i can cancel online. fit connection then tried to bill me for another month because i was not within the 30 day cancellation policy. trying to get this situation taken care of was an absolute nightmare. i am a very patient and understanding person when it comes to these types of things. the only other company i can't stand is hh gregg due to terrible customer service as well. no one could even tell me who i needed to contact or give me a correct contact number. it took me 6 people and two days to get to the right one. i emailed her and requested a call due to my concerns. she emailed me and said i waived the fee and that was it. thank you for waving the unnecessary fee but how about some concern and gusto to fix the pieces of your company that i had a problem with in the first place. absolutely terrible experience!"
1-star,0,"normally i would consider myself a very patient person with poor customer service, especially after working in the restaurant/hospitality industries previously, but fitness connection has been just plain awful. i initially planned to check out fitness connection because they offered a free 5 day trial and were located in uptown near to my office i'm working at this summer. turns out that to not be charged a much larger sign up fee you have to sign up and put a down payment that you can cancel within 5 days to avoid charges. ok, no big deal. i went to the gym twice: facilities were okay but somewhat crowded, and the gym was less convenient to the office than i expected, so i decided i didn't want to spend $20-30 per month over the summer when i have other options. i came in on the third day and cancelled my membership, received a confirmation email cancellation, and was told i would be refunded my $60 down payment and first month payment. after 2 weeks i received no refund so i called fitness connection and was told i would have to talk to the third party organization that handles their transactions. after 2 weeks and multiple calls with the third party, it turns out that fitness connection directly billed me because it was my down payment, so i would have to seek a refund directly from them. so, i called fitness connection, explained my situation to the manager at the time and was told he would call corporate and email/call me back with the next steps. after a week..no new information so i gave them another call and was told the same thing and that i ""should"" receive a refund in 3-5 days. so all in all, i signed up for a ""free 5 day trial"", have had to make at least 10 calls to fitness connection and their finance partner, and have still not received my $60 refund for using their facilities twice. also during the two times i worked out at the gym, i have never been more pressured to sign up for personal training, buy all their supplements, and get everything fitness connection that i could. as a few others have said, the clientele were mainly guys looking to get big upper bodies and not worry about legs, definitely not a place i'd want to go if you're looking to train for compound lifts without the classic bro trying to steal your bench as you grab water."
1-star,0,"i had been a member of the uptown fitness connection for about 2 years and joined under the gm, stephens leadership.. great guy! but.. the new gm skip arbuckle is a trip.. he thinks hes got some power as the gm and flexes it when possible. on may 3 i went to cnxl my membership as i will be moving from the state. i then received an email from abc financial that i was due to pay one more month as i was out of the 30 day cancelation policy. they directed me to the store level where i met mr arbuckle. i explained to him that i was moving and wouldnt need the gyms service any longer. i ask him to cnxl my membership and to give me a paper copy of my cancelation and he refused. he ask me to leave the club and threatened to call the police. i of course stood and waited for the police. i still havent been given any form of the cancelation. lets face it.. the gym is in a convienient location if you live uptown. its cheap.. $10 a month 20 if you tan but listen. my dad always says, ""you get what you pay for"". spend a few more bucks and go to a beter facility. this gym is filthy, crowded and of course.. poor customer service!"
1-star,0,"reasonably priced gym but not worth the moderate monthly cost - here's why: 1. very crowded facility swarming with personal trainers at all hours 2. strong pressure to sign-up for training services 3. i decided to try these out and had a poor experience: a. three different trainers in six months of training. none of them talked to each other, none of them transitioned training plans, and only one of them spent the time to correct form, advise on exercises, etc. - which is the main reason someone would want to use a trainer 4. the final trainer i had was an incredibly poor experience. zero personal attention, she was unable to track our appointments (i had to follow-up to confirm if a training session had been moved or not, i received passive-aggressive texts asking why i missed an appointment when i was out of town and didn't have a session scheduled, etc.), and a weak understanding of exercise science in general. if you want a cheap gym, go for it, but be prepared for crowds and trainers overrunning most areas. this is a facility designed to sell training services more than a stand-alone gym."
5-star,1,"can't say enought about the personal training i am receiving at fitness connect on morehead. the sign up process was smooth and there were a lot of options to choose from to meet my financial needs. i had an injury with my arm and alex paired me with a personal trainer who specializes in injuries. mania, my trainer is awsome! he is a true professional. in his manner, his knowledge and his ability to communicate. my arm no longer hurts and i am on the way to being in the best shape i have been in for years. i recommend the personal training at fitness connect with a 5 star score!"
2-star,0,"i usually train at the ballantyne location because it was minutes from my work. mon-wed it can get a little crowded but never enough where it limits your workout. i have no complaints really except that (like all fitness connections) they play the same crap music over and over again all day and although they say they're open 24 hrs.....well, they're not. as for the uptown location, i have heard from numerous people that its impossible to get a solid workout in after 5 during the week so i haven't even attempted to do so or had the need since ballantyne was more convenient... i'm only on this side of town on the weekends so saturday is the only time i frequent this particular location. this gym is extremely diminutive in size and even on some sat mornings i find it almost impossible to get done what i want to get done. being that its january the crowd problem is further exemplified with new years resolutionists all with bad form and clueless looks on their faces as they mope around trying to figure out what they're doing just so they can quit by february. since i'm no longer working in ballantyne and moving closer to the uptown area in a couple weeks this place is really going to be my only option besides south blvd (super ghetto). horrible. i can't wait to no longer be a member.."
4-star,1,i go to both the uptown and south park location and i am very happy. let's talk about what this gym is and what it isn't. this gym is for people who like to lift weights it is not for the weekend yoga person or for the person who likes to swim laps at a pool. after getting fed up with the y being overcrowded and over priced i joined fc. the price can't be beat and i find the vibe at the gym motivating. people are working hard there. the only thing they are missing is the traditional elliptical machines. but they have plenty of treadmills and the cross country skiing eelliptical machines. both locations are cleaner than the dowd and harris y. i don't understand why people have rated this low.. i have worked out all over the country in all the chains you can think of. for the price you are paying it is a good value.
2-star,0,"imagine all the negative stereotypes you have of a gym: overcrowding, lots of 'nightclub' lifters with big upper bodies and no legs, people jumping on equipment in the middle of your set, a see & be seen clientele (girls in makeup, etc) and did i mention the crowds? well this place has them all. it's really quite a pain in the ass kind of place. i've been lifting for a very long time (i've done bodybuilding shows) and i travel extensively for work, so i've seen all kinds of gyms- high end, blue collar, city locations, country settings, chains as well as independents and i can tell you that of them all, i like this gym least. why? because they oversell their membership and they don't fully train their front office staff to handle the basic things (out of town day passes, updating credit cards, signing people into group fitness classes, the concept of first come first serve). my check in process took way longer than what the situation required (about 15 minutes). when it was obvious that the check-in girl was new, i offered to sign in and deal with their nonsense on my way out, but no-- she'd rather make me suffer the pains of her confusion. may i recommend better employee training. obviously it's not all bad... they are in a good uptown location, they have a fair amount of free parking, they are right next to the rail line and from what i understand, their monthly dues are cheap (thus the crowds). if you're a twenty-something urbanite who likes to prowl for dates at a fitness club, then i guess this is a good spot for you. i'm at a different stage of life, i guess. if i lived here i would just pay extra for the much nicer gold's gym nearby."
1-star,0,"until recently, i was a huge fan of fitness connection--the prices are reasonable, the hours good, and the space inviting. the equipment is in good condition, and i rarely had to wait for machines. the major downfall--and the reason i hope this company goes out of business--is customer service. when i first signed up for the gym, i told agent that i'd be moving in a few months and wanted to cancel my membership then. she replied that there would be no problem and that i should cancel my membership closer to the date. why couldn't i just take care of it now? i didn't argue, just said okay. periodically, i checked it to make sure i hadn't missed my membership cancellation deadline. my desire to cancel was always clear, but the response i always got was to remind them closer to the date. well, i left town for a holiday weekend. the next week, i again asked to cancel my membership so as not to pay for an extra month. your deadline has passed, they told me, and there's nothing we can do. i had made it clear that i wanted to cancel my membership for over a month! each time they told me to do it later. and all of a sudden, they tell me i missed the deadline! fitness connection made it impossible for me to cancel my membership in a timely manner by refusing to accept notice, plain and simple. the last straw was when i tried to bring my dad to the gym as a guest. they wouldn't let him in because he didn't have an id with him, something about liability insurance. fine. annoying, but fine. but if i paid $10, they'd let him in without presenting an id. somehow, paying them money suddenly made the liability issue vanish. stay away from this company! you can find plenty of gyms that are just as nice and that don't take advantage of customers. it's time to put fitness connection out of business."
3-star,0,"not bad for the money. i went to the uptown location for a couple of years because i worked in the same building so it was super convenient. there were times where the place was packed and i ended up leaving because there were no available machines. they have a nice variety of fitness classes as well, but those can ridiculously full, to the point where it becomes a safety issue (once during a group power class i almost hit another person in the head with my barbell, we were that close). i eventually stopped going to that location for one simple reason. the a/c. there were times i started sweating from just walking in the place. and there's nothing management can do about it (believe me, i know plenty of people who have complained about it). now i go to the location on south boulevard. the place is so much bigger than the uptown location. it's also much cooler. my only complaint is that the room where they hold the classes has windows on one side that look out into the rest of the gym. not something i'm crazy about when i looked like a beached whale while trying to do zumba."
4-star,1,"been a member for about 3 months now and so far so good. the gym is $20 a month so really can't beat that - there's a membership fee at the start but make sure to haggle with them as i had my fee knocked down to $29! classes come with the gym as well but i just haven't checked them out yet. i hit up the uptown location which has always been clean whenever i go. this location tends to get busy, especially after work, but i've actually never had an issue getting a treadmill or the glider machine - plenty of equipment at this location. one downside is the machines don't have tvs - small complaint but hey, tv distracts me and makes me stay longer. the hours on the weekends are short, closing at 5 - booooo. and as a heads up, the uptown gym does have free parking in the parking garage beside it except on home panthers game... then you have to pay $10 to park... but really, who chooses gym over tailgating?! update to review: new extended hours! awesome sauce."
1-star,0,"my boyfriend and i were members here for a long time. we both ended our membership several months ago. somehow my cancellation turned into a huge nightmare and i ended up paying an extra $190 over the contract agreement. even though i only signed up for a year and fufilled my original contact, they wanted me to fax in all these different things to cancel. their corporate office sent a ""we miss you, come back"" 5 days pass. my boyfriend used it for 2 days, then the management at this location refused to let him redeem the other 3 days, even though he had been a paying member for 3 years prior and was on the fence about rejoining. this wasn't a pass he clipped out of a magazine. their corporate office mailed it directly to him. poor customer service. there are too many other places to work out for this place to get our return business."
4-star,1,"i've been a member for about 6 months now and am enjoying it very much. classes are great, although there are many offered only during the day that i would like to try, but can only take classes after work. the cardio machines get very crowded at peak times but i can usually find something to do. uptown location is a bit smaller but south blvd location has a little more space. very much enjoy group power, yoga, and cycling classes through the group fitness. bathrooms aren't always the cleanest they could be but overall very happy with membership."
3-star,0,"i've been a member here for a little over a year and it's been a good experience overall. i pay the $14.99/month fee (i had to pay a $45 initial fee as well though) and find it to be a good deal. it's kind of a small place being in an office building, but it has everything that i need as far as weightlifting and cardio. they just got new equipment about a year ago, so everything is good shape for the most part. that's a plus. i would suggest avoiding the after work time between 5-7pm on weekdays as it gets crowded! luckily my job allows me flexibility to come in the middle of the morning or afternoon, so i rarely have any issues."
1-star,0,"liked this facility until i had a bad experience w another member. i go to the gym and mind my own business, always. out of nowhere some loser i've never seen makes a very inappropriate gesture to me. since then he still disgusts me. it's really too bad this gym is attracting that type of clientele. look out for the ugly guy in the black beater. im prob going to find a new gym to go to. this type of nonsense is just uncalled for to say the least."
1-star,0,"terrible gym, facilities, rude customer service and the group fitness is awful! the ""south park"" gym is actually on south boulevard a pretty far cry from south park. unfortunately or fortunately i was injured and had a medical excuse not to be a member anymore, but they would not accept it! i have gone back and forth with them even though it is in my contract that if you have a medical excuse you will be canceled. i dealt with their customer service through abc financial and they don't care about you. then i called the corporate office and they were also very rude and the customer service person named rebecca told me i was selfish and hung up on me. customer service at it's best at sports and firtness. this place is seriously ruthless. it is pretty pathetic how they really need that $20 a month and don't care about their reputation. save your time and money and don't get stuck in the stupid contract."
4-star,1,"there aren't very many amenities, it's very crowded during peak times, not open very late on weekends but at $20 a month you can't really complain. staff are friendly, machines always work, and everyone is pretty respectful about wiping down their machines and not taking too long if they know you are waiting. they tried to push the personal training on me, but i said no and they dropped it."
1-star,0,"after the constant harassment from here i have to downgrade this to 1 star. how can military orders not be accept for a valid excuse to cancel the membership? i dont even live in charlotte anymore! **update** after over a month of going back and forth, my account is now cancelled effective august 16, 2012. somehow their 30 cancellation notice turned into 90 days."
1-star,0,"my membership began with a phone call to the sports and fitness club. the recruiter had offered me a great deal. $1 to sign up and the first month is free. so i ran down to join and right at the end of all of the paperwork he wanted me to pay $50 to sign up. what a scam. i was so upset i should not have signed up. i was actually arguing with them while i was joining. so on the day i first worked out i noticed they have a woman cleaning the mens locker room which was strange to get used to. then, my girlfriend's card was declined so we were charged $15 each for that issue which really upset me. i was under the impression that if you have no contract, then there is no obligation. do not assume this. so i was fed up and wanted to cancel. yet there is more obligation that i was unaware of. you can't just quit at sports and fitness. you are required to pay for an additional month of membership. their excuse is that they are processing the membership cancelation. i tried so hard calling their financial agency (whom by the way, is not sports and fitness) and they would not give me a break at all. so just assume that whatever they tell you at sign up, is not the full truth, and may even be lies. you really can't expect much from a gym that charges $20 except for things that are cheap."
4-star,1,"for the price, you can't beat it - $20 a month to go to any location, classes included? heck yeh! so why not 5 stars? i'm glad you asked! - there is no towel service, nor amenities should you need to shower, which is a bit of a bummer (i sweat. i'd like to shower, to alleviate that) - at peak times, they can get awfully crowded - i kinda wish there was a little more consistency in the operating hours between locations (one location might be 24 hours m-saturday, and another might close at 6 pm during the week) - staff doesn't always seem up to speed on what's going on in the location (example: this week, i attended a class that was listed on the white board as being led by what is clearly a man's name, and when i got into class, the teacher was clearly not a guy. when i inquired at the front desk after class as to who taught the class, they looked at the white board and relayed the guy's name to me. no one seemed to know who the mystery teacher was) then again: it's $20 a month, so i can't really complain too much when the equipment is new, in good repair, and the class variety is pretty sweet. i've loved my membership and definitely get my money's worth. (the image is the morehead street/ downtown location)"
1-star,0,"i thought this place would be great because the facility is clean and theres alot of machines, the problem lies with the managers pushing the personal training on you. i told them that i wasnt sure if i would be around enough since i travel constantly and am rarely home which is why i signed up for the month to month plan, finally i relented and signed up for twice a month personal training, under the impression that it was another month to month deal. as planned, i left town for 2 months and tried to call to adjust my personal training, it took me a week and a half to even get a hold of a manager to talk to, and when i finally did i was given 3 different phone numbers and finally an email to talk to someone. after i called and left a voicemail with the woman in charge, i recieved an email telling me that i'd still be charged for the coming month and that i'd be charged with 25% of the remaining fees for the personal training i had not used yet for the rest of the year. never was i told i was being put into a contract like this and after i explained to the woman that i was never told that i was being bound into a year long contract she still did not reply. do not go to this gym they have unethical business practices"
3-star,0,"i was a member of the sports and fitness club in ballantyne for two years. it was actually a peak fitness when i first became a member there. it's the only location that i have ever worked out at and the building is only a few years old. for the most part they took pretty good care of the equipment and did their best to keep things working. i will say that this gym is very busy due to the low monthly pricing. make sure you read any fine print because at those low prices they were charging a membership fee once a year of approx. $30 or so. since this gym is used so much it does kind of have that odor and feel of a 'dirty gym' at times but i did see them cleaning a lot. i'm not 100% sure that a lot of the people using the machines were cleaning after themselves. shame on them! another sign was the wear and soiled carpet going in and out of the restrooms. again this is probably to be expected in a gym with high traffic. it's not at all a bad place to workout, and for the price i guess you can't complain!"
4-star,1,"i just joined fitness connection (fc) last year while living in charlotte. joining and pricing: i will say, it was easy to get a 5 day pass online and come in for a workout. the sales team is standardly sales for the industry - a tour of the facility, talking about your goals, and then finally a visit to their office where you discuss pricing options. having worked in rmany gyms before, i knew the drill. basically, you're going to pay an ""enrollment fee"" most of the time, from $100-$200. i wasn't interested in this and the manager overheard me mention my history of working in gyms and offered me a $49 enrollment fee. still not great but certainly better than $200. if you can join during a special, i'd advise doing so for a reduced or eliminated enrolling fee. don't be pressured by their ""today only"" deals and be willing to walk away (to me, joining a gym is a bit like buying a car - the fees are a bit ridiculous and always negotiable if you do it right). there are no contracts and a 30-day cancellation policy, which is outlined when you join. memberships range from $9.99 to $19.99 per month, depending on if you wish to use multiple locations and want to bring a guest. this fc has child care as well (never used it). hours are good throughout the week - this facility is open early and closes late but others are open 24/7. when i joined, i went for the cheapest option as i don't intend to use multiple facilities and generally workout alone. this location does not offer towels or towel service; i came from a golds and was use to this but i know this can be a deal breaker for some. the experience: for $10/month, i have found that fitness connection offers everything i need at a good price - definitely better than a planet fitness. it's cheaper than a y over time and certainly not as busy, though i haven't been to fc past 5pm so i can't speak to the end of day busy time. people are generally pretty nice, and there aren't a lot of stereotypical meatheads or body builders. it's a good place for people with all kinds of fitness goals. the actual facility itself, as i said, has everything i was looking for. there is a mix of new and older cardio equipment from stairmasters to amts and treadmills. i've never seen them all utilized at once and they seem to be in generally good shape. there are also two areas for weight lifting including selectorized machines, plate loaded machines, a deadlifting platform, smith machine, squat rack x2, and benches. much like the cardio, these pieces seem to be a mix of old and new. some are missing pins and occasionally i've needed to track down plates, but they're not in awful disrepair. i'm more often annoyed that no one seems to re-rack their weights (but i can't fault fc staff for this). in addition to cardio and weights, fc offers an indoor track, personal training, trx training, and group exercise and spin studios with multiple classes. other locations also have pools and sport courts, if that's something you're interested in. the facility: i'd like to point out that the location certainly isn't in south park, even though the name implies it. this location is near south and tyvola. not inconvenient for me, but also definitely not in south park. like i said, the facility itself is large and open. i've never had an issue with crowding despite going different times in the morning and afternoon. i enjoy the layout and think it works well. i have used the locker rooms multiple times and although the women's locker room is a weird layout (there are ellipticals in there?), it's not awful. there's a dry sauna as well as full showers, mirrors, and changing rooms. the lockers are a good size and fit my very full backpack. one point i will harp on is the general cleanliness of the building. every time i'm there, i've seen a member of staff cleaning or taking care of trash. it's nice to see, but i'm not quite sure how thorough their cleaning regime actually is. i've never seen them cleaning the machines, and though you're encouraged to wipe them down after use it would be even nicer to see staff cleaning them. additionally, the floors are usually pretty dirty (especially in the locker rooms - lots of hair everywhere) even early in the morning, and it appears the mirrors throughout the building aren't cleaned very frequently either. more importantly are the bugs. in less than two weeks i've seen cockroaches in multiple areas of the gym, from the fitness floor to the locker room. one remained on the floor every day for three days. i've spoken to management about it, and they have let me know they're aware of it and recently sprayed, but it's still concerning. where there's one, there's more. overall, it's a good gym if you're willing to bring your own towel and don't pay close attention to the cleanliness. i knew what i wanted when i joined and this beat the y in terms of price, location, and amenities. just wish it was cleaner!"
1-star,0,"poor maintenance of the facility's. locker rooms dirty, showers and shower curtains covered in mold, walls crumbling, still no internet in 2018 even though the info scroller at the bottom of the tv channels all say they have internet. studio space restricted to classes only even when not in use. ""stretching area"" on main floor is very small and crammed with equipment like a giant punching bag, gravity straps, and other equipment, this area will accommodate maybe 3 people with a passive excercise routine. club management just seems to shrug and pass the responsibility off on the corporate office. don't waste your money here."
1-star,0,"the gym is not bad. the equipment needs some updating but it gets the job done.the reason for my 1 star review is b/c of my personal training experience. a really nice guy named phillip oglesby signed me up 6 month program made up of 1 workout session per week and diet plan. i was so excited, josh handled my workout program and he was amazing. phillip handled my diet plan and that were things went bad. for the first 3 months he never provided me a diet plan. i asked about my diet plan during that 3 month period a handful of times when i saw him at the gym and he always said he would get on it right away but it never happened until i sent an upset email to him wanting to cancel the diet portion of my contract. then we spoke at the gym and all he had to say was ""i am so sorry i forgot"" and i was like so am i still going to get charged for the diet portion of my contract and he said ""i'm sorry there are no refunds"". then he said ""josh will handle my diet from now on."" josh provided me my diet plan and nutrition advise but i was already over it. i stuck with the program b/c i was stuck paying for it either way and josh did provide me with some great work outs and nutrition advise. i would not recommend a training program with this location, due to customer service."
3-star,0,"meh. eh. i go here, but i got spoiled by the nicer locations. the new ballantyne location got so many upgrades, that now i feel spoiled. this south blvd location is fine. it has the machines that you want, and the weird machines that move your whole body when you use them. it's got two squat racks, a deadlift area, and a ton of benches. it also has the smallest track that i've ever seen, it surrounds the group fitness and cycling rooms. the staff told me that they will be getting upgrades eventually, so that's hopeful? the other locations have free wi-fi, newer equipment and a larger variety of machines and weights. but the south blvd location really is fine, and it gets the job done. i took 10 mins of a cycle class here and wasn't into it, i walked out (because again, i'm spoiled). i have yet to take a group fitness class, i've never seen one going on while i was there. it is an a-ok gym. stick to what you know, don't get ""new ways to use the weigh machines"" ideas from pinterest, re-rack your weights, and it'll be fine."
5-star,1,"i have taken the mixxfit and bodypump classes with latoya and patrica. they are both amazing, energetic and great instructors. even when first starting to class i never felt lost. would highly recommend both them and their classes."
1-star,0,"don't get pt sessions unless you have a healthy body and no reason to ever cancel!!! if you do want pt sessions make sure you tell them the day you sign up you want to cancel, because there is no trial period. you will be billed for two months regardless at $40 a session ($320). there's a 30 day cancellation process right off the bat. oh, if you want to cancel, make sure you don't tell your trainer, call the main office directly. the trainer (alex) will make you feel like you can finish the month out that you've paid for and see if you want to keep training or not, but he won't pass your cancellation request up to the only person that will handle your account (aj) because he wants to get that extra month of pay. and the trainers won't remind you that only aj can handle your request. and the trainers won't own their mistake and pay for the month the allowed you to re-up on. they screwed my girlfriend over just as i described above and she has to quit pt due to an upcoming shoulder surgery. so be careful trusting these trainers with your wallet. she just wanted to try it out to see if it would help her fitness goals, but they have a more permanent motive in mind. bathrooms are clean and you don't have to share equipment too often...but if you can't trust their financial ethics, then what's the point? there's other gyms in the area that will treat your wallet better. ie: crossfit. they will cancel on the spot and prorate what part of the month you used. that's where i go. i went to this gym with my gf numerous times just for support and the fun of working out together. but gyms like crossfit will respect you and your wallet and not lock you in to contracts you were aware of or tell you your good to cancel when you not. keep it in mind."
4-star,1,"here is an update to the review i gave a couple days ago. a few pieces of equipment were still ""under repair"" today. for the smith machine one of the pegs that holds the bar was missing in one of the most used heights/levels. and the cable machine still had a sign signifying it's ""coming"" repair. as you can imagine my frustration at only one cable machine available and it being probably one of the most used items in there. i mean what exactly is my membership paying for? so i went to the front desk to remind them to please have these items fixed and i received nothing but concern and professionalism. aj greeted me as soon as i approached the desk even with other patrons in line. he listened to the issue and told me he would get right on it. not only did he go check the equipment out but he took it upon himself to help fix the smith machine right away. and he even followed up with me apologizing for my inconvenience and letting me know he would call maintenance asap. i'm writing this review because yes this gym gets a bad rep for being older, having older equipment, or looking outdated/messy but they are improving their equipment and at least one staff member there gives a fuck! thank you aj! i'll see you tomorrow!"
2-star,0,i've attended the various fitness connections across charlotte and this location is my least favorite. it is very old and doesn't seem clean at all. this gym could definitely benefit from some maintenance.
1-star,0,"normally i don't write reviews unless i have a really great experience or a really bad experience. in this case, its the latter. this gym is obviously poorly managed. some of the equipment is falling apart and has been out of order for weeks without repair. nobody re-racks their weights. there are dumbbells and plates everywhere. it can be really hard to find the plates you are looking for because they are just scattered everywhere throughout the gym. people generally don't wipe off the machines or benches after they are done using them. this place is really a mess. at the end of the night when the gym is about to close, the staff don't put anything back, they just leave it a disaster for the next morning. the price of this gym is pretty good, but it is not worth it. pay the extra $20 a month to go somewhere that you can actually enjoy your workout. when i went to sign up for a membership, the person i worked with actually lied to me and said that they did not offer one of the memberships that was on their website. i showed it to them and had to sit in the gym and sign up on my phone to get the price i wanted. they were going to charge me a $200 startup fee, when the fee on the website was only $60. i already got a membership somewhere else and won't be going back to fitness connection hopefully ever again."
2-star,0,"appears to have older equipment but beware if you are from out of own as their daily rate is $15, about 3x as much as other places including ymcas or crossfits."
2-star,0,"this gym is terrifyingly weird. sooo old. equipment, bathrooms, group rooms were in pretty bad shape. terrible layout. air condition was broken during the class i went to. all kinds of people in your way since the layout is so cramped. 20 people lunging at the same time across the whole gym. i'm sorry but what a gross place. can't think of any positives except for the fitness manager seems really nice."
1-star,0,"after a year long membership here, i decided to not stay. worst gym in las vegas. last summer, the air conditioner wasn't working and i sweated my asshole off. sweat was all over the floor. huge roaches crawling in the shower and they never clean. gotta love showering with huge bugs. the cardio equipment doesn't work properly and they won't fix it. all of the equipment is very old and the weight machines are either broken or clogged up. back in april, the entire back row of treadmills were flooded out because the roof was leaking. corporate and management does not care about complaints. this gym is primarily for grunters. if you like to drop the free weights, grunt, bring a gallon of water,and watch lunkers then it's the perfect gym for you. nothing like running on a treadmill underwater while someone screams"" rawr"" fun times at fitness for the lunkers !!! at 10 dollars a month, you can't beat the entertainment and you never know when the roof will leak. swimming pool right on the cardio equipment. heck yeah!!!!"
5-star,1,"absolutely love this gym! worked out here for a few months until i had to cancel my membership because i moved. however this gym is great, friendly staff, not crowded and always clean."
5-star,1,"this gym is great. always come once i get off work, even the staff are great. the thing i like about this gym it's not crowded like how other gyms are. the good thing about it it's close from where i live so that's a big thumbs up for me."
1-star,0,"i used to love coming here back in 2009-2011, even though corporate had no idea (and still doesn't) what it takes to run a gym properly. it was empty, the staff (especially cecilia) was excellent. new management and corporate doesn't take complaints seriously. they don't take care of their employees, they definitely don't care about their members, and they could care less about their club. it's becoming crowded and i'm usually being leered at by some perv (the manager, david, is also a perv). speaking of the manager, i've seen him get in guests' faces and yell at them. blame them for the incompetency of his own doing. he never takes responsibility for problems and blames other employees or guests. he has no sense of behaving properly as a manager. the only upgrade to the whole place has come with the addition of dawn offering a lot of dance/fitness classes. they also fixed the air, but if it's close to 110 outside, it's going to be around 85+ in the gym. the bathrooms in the women's locker room tend to be gross and i've heard from some of the other members that the showers are also gross. my boyfriend also has said that the men's locker room is pretty disgusting most of the time. other than that, it's okay and you're able to get a pretty good workout if you aren't waiting because someone is taking a half hour on a machine or bench just sitting on their phones or taking selfies."
4-star,1,"before i joined this gym about 8 months ago i read the reviews on yelp. the reviews compare this gym to the country atlethic club or the mega gyms which isnt fair. its like comparing spirit airlines to first class on an international flight. with that said its a great gym if you live close by. i stop by on my way home from work. they have a tanning room, aerobic room (zumba m-f), a cardio room with 24 treadmills and about 15 elliptical machines, a fitness ball room with mats, the dumbbell area, more weight and cardio machines in the main area and a rock climbing wall. the gym is full mirrored for the muscle heads. what i like most is the ease of getting in and out. everyone is just chill here. no chics in silly make up or guys grunting. they have tvs near the treadmills and bike area. the hours are reasonable...mostly 5-11 or 7-9 on the weekends. ive been to 24 and that place was over whelming and 24 hour fitness is too expensive. they lose a star because the towel and soap dispenser in the locker room is always broke. why is it automated? just put them in a stack on the counter. the world will move on. oh, it is only $10 a month and something like a $35 admin fee that they charge around the 3rd month. its well worth it."
4-star,1,ive been a member since october 2013. the gym is pretty basic. gets the job done never really crowded or creepy! makes working out more enjoyable. they also offer tanning included w most memeberships.
3-star,0,"was stuck on giving them a 2 star or 3 but i guess minus the crappy hrs the gym is quite decent. working 10 hr shifts makes it tough to work out here debating on switching to planet fitness same price only 24 hrs this gym has everything you need really bench, squat rack, smith machine leg press...etc i do wish they had a rack with curl bars of different weights. they have great cardio machines and plenty of them. this gym has everything you need plus more for $10 no contract what more do you want"
5-star,1,great place to work out for those who really work out. old gold gym and still has all the weights i need. lvac is nice but the parking and crowds are bad. this place i walk and and work out with little to no wait. staff is friendly.
2-star,0,"my husband has been coming here for 5 months and had been getting me to go. i finally decided to come as a guest last week and the first impression was really really bad. i tried out their treadmill and that section was not only poorly lighted, but every machine i looked at was beyond disgusting and dirty. it looked like the machines haven't been cleaned in months and there were used tissues laying in the water bottle holders... eeeek!!! also if your planning on having a guest come with you and [visit] the gym be prepared to pony up $5 for each visit, which i think is silly. you have to pay $5 just to check out the gym and without any staff to walk you around and show you the ropes or give you insight on what the gym offers? give me a break... all these things combined made for a very poor first impression and i frankly rather dish out $15 or $20 a month to have a clean and professional gym."
3-star,0,"i love this gym, relatively speaking though. this gym is cheap! only 4 people are there whenever i used to go there! the poor lighting and the atmosphere felt insanely depressing. i specifically went to this gym to simply focus on lifting weights with no wait and no attractive women to distract me. the last thing i want to do is get a hard-on during a bench press. kidding! well, sorta."
3-star,0,"good: most machines and free weights you need to work out cheaper per month than most 1 meal buffets lots of members look scary - makes you want to work out harder lots of members look dangerous - makes you want to work out harder great location off sahara, close to food 4 less - workout & eat cheap. minimal to no wait for equipment bad: looks frightful and unpleasant everywhere (workout areas, lockers, bathrooms) no water stuff - sauna, pool, jacuzzi. for just $22 a month now days i can get vegas athletic club membership for much better amenities, pleasant and environment to workout at. come on, extra $12 a month? if you can't afford extra $12 a month, you can buy a 5 gallon bottle of water and use it as your in-home gym. save $10 a month! i'll stick to this club for now. i like the rugged horrid look it has. makes me feel more manly."
1-star,0,"i canceled my membership and they pulled $60 out of my account due to an error that they had after switching from fitness works to youfit. they said they would refund my money, but they didn't and i had to file a fraud claim with my credit union."
1-star,0,"this is by far the worst gym i have ever been to. i am a veteran and i have seen places in third world countries nicer than this place. the machines never work, the gym is an absolute pigsty, and the staff could use a refresher on proper etiquette and manners. i signed up and it's supposed to be a 10 dollar membership and i was charged 80 dollars in the first month! i calmly confronted the staff and i got attitude and a 1-800 number. staff don't want to build relationship with the people trying to change their lives a 1 star review is giving this place a little too much. avoid at all cost and go to la fitness, planet fitness, or even your home gym in better than this chain!"
1-star,0,horrible gym they have old equipment and charge you $40 a year because they buy new equipment that is a lie they have old rusty equipment which they charge 1 month after you start you have to give a 15 day notice of cancellation and they will still charge you crazy fees no matter what the staff is so rude unprofessional and uncaring the manager no different than the other employees it is a ghetto gym i am still struggling to get my money back that they keep charging and overdrafting my bank please people save your money and go elsewhere la fitness is a little more expensive but we'll worth it staff is nice helps you in any way and a lot cleaner this gym is a fraud
1-star,0,"smh... sales girl was rude and was so focused on her ""script"" it was hard to even get a word in. oh and at one point one of the front desk girls came up to her to ask for something not to sure what and she was so snappy with her in front of me then talks crap about her to me as she walks away. sn the childcare looks like a prison with bars everywhere... but it was nice to see the attendant interacting with the few kids in there and doing a craft. safe to say i didn't sign up nor will i ever."
1-star,0,terrible terrible terrible terrible terrible terrible my wife and i just signed up and have been here less than one month. i came in today and 8 yes 8 running machines were inoperable. the one that i did get had a glitch that would make it skip and pause in the middle of a run which caused me to almost fall off. rather than continue running and sue the shit out of them for having defective machines i informed them of the issue. i was met with a very rude and curt gm and worker who told me there was nothing wrong with the machine. i then showed them what was wrong with it. the worker then became very rude and continued to try to stare me down. i was able to have a relatively decent conversation with a trainer but the problem is at the top. rather than thank me for helping them instead they were confrontational. join at your own peril
1-star,0,"i closed my account back in 2009 or 2010 and i just found out that for the past 7 or 8 years that fitness works has been charging me for a cancelled account that i closed with them because i was moving to another state that they did not have a gym in. i am in the process of purchasing a home and to find out i did not qualify because of the $2,000 collection that fitness works put on me that was opened in 2014. i was so shocked i had such high hopes and now iam learning that fitness works has been scamming people like this for years. i never received not 1 phone call or collection letter from this company or a final bill. i didnt even think about this until it haunted me tonight. fitness works is a fraud cant believe they are still in business. i dont even know wherre to start to get this issue resolved. everyone just keeps saying good luck with getting that worked out"
1-star,0,"this is by far the most disgusting gym i've ever been to in my life, its never clean, the trainers will screw you any which way that they can, they will take your money and give you faulty sessions meaning they will schedule you when even you have no idea. the gym always has the biggest dust bunnies ive ever seen in my life. the studio's where the classes are held are never mopped, the children center is absolutely filthy. i was a member for quite some time here at the glendale location, i thought that maybe it would turn around, but thats kind of difficult when the gm jose himself never leaves his desk. and when you try to speak to him about any matters he looks at you like he's confused and then he says ""ill follow up with you"" or ""ill have ashley check on that and she'll get ahold of you"" and no one ever gets back to you, ive tested this theory personally and i also have some friends that were members as well that have had the same shit happen to them! this gym is a disgrace to the fitness industry, it only wants your money, they want you to hold your end while they dont hold theirs. the machines are always broken and the staff is absolutely horrible. i have absolutely no positives to say about this gym. im going to eos. and you should too!"
1-star,0,"if i could give a 0 i would. this place is a complete rid off. the bbb, google reviews, and corporate have all been informed. i was charged a total of $578 for services i am not recieving that has been cancelled and getting a refund has been a nightmare. i realistically should be recieving $1734 since my personal trainer constantly forgot about appointments, showed up late and canceled on us for a month. the receptionist is beyond rude and the general manager, and managers are impossible to get in contact with and don't call you back when they promise to. i talked to corporate and was told that only three people work at the corporate office and the recptionist there told me the person incharge of refunds was out of town for a week."
2-star,0,truly nothing spectacular about this place. old equipments that need to be switched out. buuuuut it's $10/month & the equipment meet my training needs. i use to do orange theory & la fitness but that was over $100/month and they close early where i couldn't get to class on certain days of the week :(. miss them but this gym is open 24 hrs so why not.
1-star,0,place is a dump. old equipment and stair masters and treadmills are 20 years old and half don't work. tvs on wall are so small and tv monitors on that cardio machines don't work. spa has dirty and human body skin on top of foam and water and staff don't do any cleaning. bathrooms are disgusting and never no toilet paper. changing room smells and nothing but old men walking around naked. staff is rude. when i went to cancel my membership they asked why and when i told them they didn't so oh i'm sorry we are working on it please stay or here is two months no charge nothing to get me to stay. just looked at me strange and said ok sign here. then walking out i heard them telling new members that we are newly owned and changing a lot. fyi. steer clear. they also try to take dues out twice a month. another task to call and take care of that.
1-star,0,"the gym is ok. here's my beef, and i've been almost a year trying to resolve it... there are multiple memberships on my account. i go in and cancel them, then before i know it, the company that does their billing is contacting me again. i am not under contract. i had to have my bank decline their multiple charges, because they won't fix it. i can't tell you how many hours i've spent, and how many times i've been told it's all resolved, and it never is. i will never have anything to do with them again--if i can ever get free. if by some miracle it ever gets resolved, i'll update, but i'm not holding my breath. if you value your credit score, stay away."
2-star,0,"be very careful when signing up for personal training sessions. signing that contract is like committing to a mortgage. god forbid something happens and you want to post pone your sessions...aka. payments. i have 9 more sessions that i already paid for but i can't use them until i buy more.... they won't hear you out and will kick you out of the gym. otherwise i like the gym, it's too bad they're inflexible and that i am being forced out. also, customer service is great when they're signing you up, but thereafter is egh..."
1-star,0,wtf is with this payment/canceling scheme they're running? surprised they haven't had a class action lawsuit. i'm sure they will in the near future.
1-star,0,wow .. i live right down the street and i had hit a 3 day pass. went in and the guy would not let me workout because my zip code was not from the area. what bull shit !! i will never come back to this shitty non great full place. i might of signed up of it weren't for that ass hole !!!!
1-star,0,i will never recommend this gym to anyone i know. the equipment is always broken the staff is so unfriendly. the sales team is horrible. i had an issue with not being told about a $40 annual fee and talked to the sales associate and he basically called me a liar over the phone and was extremely rude. why i was being charged an annual fee only two weeks after being a member is completely mind boggling. never go here!
1-star,0,"worse choice i've ever made. trainers are great but horrible customer service especially for their ""manager"" chris. i don't even think he is a manager or has ever been a manager in the past. billing sucks, totally robed money from me and it never got resolved! they tell you to sign up but when you don't show up for classes they still charge you and don't respect your next sessions. lost $1300 dollars and never got a refund nor a call from them. the gm doesn't even do anything about it. this place sucks. save your money and go else where."
1-star,0,"i was severely injured at this gym while under the supervision and guidance of one of their 'certified instructors'. my body went into shock as i collapsed into a cold sweat and struggled to maintain consciousness. the manager on duty at the time was named mark. after being assisted into the men's locker room, they brought in the chiropractor who has a practice (a very busy practice) located inside of this gym. they weren't sure if an ambulance should be called, but it was clear i was coming and going in and out of shock. the chiropractor took some x-rays and noted a sublimated disc at l2-l3 of my spine. the next few days at my home were some of the most painful days i have ever experienced. i could not tie my shoes without practically breaking down into tears. after numerous attempts bending until the pain was too much, i'd take a breath, and try again, over and over and over again until i could endure the pain long enough and tie the shoe fast enough. then i could repeat this process until i got my other shoe tied. sleeping was quite difficult trying to find a comfortable position that wasn't sending lightning bolts of pain up my spine. i spent about $2500 on the chiropractor and followed all of his instructions to finally get some relief about 2 weeks later. not complete relief, but relief enough that shoe tying was no longer a 20 minute battle every morning. then i discovered fitness works was continuing to bill me $250 every two weeks for more personal training. during this time, no one at fitness works did a welfare check on me, including the manager 'mark' who witnessed this injury when it occurred. they said i had to come back to the gym to fill out a membership freeze request. i hobbled in as best i could, still in considerable pain and not having full movement only to have the unpleasant experience of dealing with this 'mark' person once again. his attitude was dismissive and though no one had explained or volunteered to fill out the medical freeze form for me prior to this point, under severe duress i signed the paperwork so the billing would stop and after more rude and unnecessary unpleasantness from mark, i was glad this automated billing system would stop and that i would be getting a refund for what was taken. i've since learned a standard medical freeze is just 90 days, but mark decided this first medical freeze should only be for 60 days. while i'm dumping $2500 into the chiropractor at the gym i suddenly notice another charge for personal training for $250 appear on my credit card without any notice or phone call from the staff asking me if i'm ready to come back. at this point i started dealing with chris, another manager at the gym. chris seemed genuinely concerned and wanted to do the right thing. he told me medical freezes are a standard 90 days and ask me why my first one was only for 60 days. i told him he'd have to ask mark that. now repeat this process 5 more times over the course of the next 15 months, with the final putting me up against this mark character again. mark likes to treat people as if they work for him. he likes to ask questions to appear in control. but when you ask mark questions, he won't answer them. he realizes the one asking the questions is the one on offense, and answering questions puts him on defense. remember this psychology any time you face the unfortunate task of dealing with mark. don't let his intimidation or size distract you or cause you to lose your focus. if necessary, leave and can come back later and talk with someone else. i'd also recommend you do what i did and use your phone to voice record the entire conversation (he doesn't have to know - arizona is a one-party state.) these recordings can be use as legal submissions of evidence should you need to go to court or escalate your complaint to the president or vice-president of the company. talking to mark reminded me of being 14 years old again and dealing with the high school bully. he lacks the most basic of customer service skills and how he became and has stayed a manager at this fitness works location is a puzzle. the journalist inside of me suspects nepotism, but didn't think it would be a very compelling story for my publisher either way, so i didn't pursue those answers. after more than a year of this nonsense, they tried once more to bill me for training that i am still not cleared by my doctor to do, but the charge did not go through (imagine why). i received a phone call from the billing company instructing me to go to my local fitness works with my current billing info. this was my last interaction with mark. mark ultimately gave me what i requested, but first he had be sure he did his best to harass me and push all of my buttons. when he wasn't getting the reaction he wanted, he gave up and gave me what i asked for. i was told by both mark and chris what i wanted couldn't be done and by the end of the day, they both got each un-doable task completed"
1-star,0,"i'm not usually one to go out of my way and write a review, but this place is so awful i had to save anyone else from considering it. i even went out of my way and made an account just so all of you could know. i had a membership there right before i moved to flagstaff, and been a member for about a year. during my time i would go there at random times throughout the day. evenings were the messiest, the most crowded and you could hardly tell they had the air conditioning on. mornings and late nights were the times i would recommend due to cleanliness, organization, and availability of equipment; however, this is only if you do decide to sign up with this gym because you have no choice. few of the staff were nice, the majority were no help and rude, the guys were perverted, and not to mention the manager, chris, who would say anything just to get you out of his presence, even lie. oh, and it's true about some of the equipment being broken and taking too long to get fixed and about being harassed into getting personal training. oh and when you've called too many times to complain the staff pulls up your file and they always go over your ""notes"" and then they begin to give you attitude. it never failed. in the end when i wanted to discontinue, they wanted me to pay an extra couple hundred for a month of personal training that i would never get to use since they did not inform me that i had sessions left. so yes i called the corporation and complained and i was stuck talking to them and settling things for months after i cancelled. one lady, rebecca, that worked at headquarters understood my situation and was nice enough to half the sum of money they were forcing me to pay. however a month later, i still got a call from collections saying i never made the payment to which i had to call headquarters again so they could call collections and have it cleared up. fitness works is a terrible gym to put your trust into. i learned the hard way. there is so much more to my experiences with them but i think i've said enough. they are scheming little frauds and will do anything to try and take your money."
1-star,0,"worst customer service and equipment! the gym is always dirty, the equipment is always broken, the customer service is terrible and it must be a horrible place to work cause i see a ton of people complaining to the staff, about the staff and the conditions there and they have a high turn over rate for employees. personal trainers come and harass you to sign up and do their person training sessions. the lockers always smell, pool always has a weird film on it and the tile is always slimey. pool weights and items are always broken, mangled and not well kept. i can go on for days..."
1-star,0,"i am a young, single mother in debt because of this gym. i tried a free 3 month trial but had some financial issues before the 3 months was up. i have been given the run around about canceling from multiple people. i now owe a few hundred dollars and get calls from debt collectors all because of a free trial."
1-star,0,"its a nice facility however i notice that they allow kids to be running around messing with all the equipment while adults are trying to get a serious workout in. the classes are awesome. i noticed the muscle bound trainers like to stop and flirt with the women that are trying to work out. if they are ""offering assistance"" shouldn't they be offering it to everyone? js"
1-star,0,"wish i could leave a negative star rating for this place. i had signed up before the place was ever opened as i live right by the place and would be able to walk there. i enjoyed it for the first few years, but then life and change of jobs kept me from going. i kept the membership for awhile after that in hopes of going back, but finally realized i was not going to. so i called to cancel the membership....this was in 2008. i was told i had to have a written letter of cancellation. ok, fine.....i brought in a letter to them and gave it to the manager. since my billing period has half over and they require a 30day notice, i had to pay for another full month, ok, i get it, 30day notice. the problem is they kept billing me, i spoke with them and they claimed they would fix it and refund me. never happened, so i cancelled the card that was on file with them. i knew about the 1 year contract, no problem, i had been a member there for years, so the contract had been completed and on a month to month basis. so i go and check my credit scores as i am going for a new house and here is this bad debt that just recently was filed with one of the credit bureaus (about 3 months ago), showing last payment made in 2008. after some research i figured out that this is some shady collection agency that does collections for various fitness clubs. i was never contacted by this company, my address, phone number and everything is still the same. why fitness works turned my closed account (closed in writing), that had always been paid on time via automatic draft, over to a collections agency i do not know. so this may end up costing my money in a higher interest rate on a home loan. i am going to be filling a complaint with the better business bureau."
1-star,0,"read this please! my friend recommended me this gym when it opened. we went and tried it but had a terrible experience with the front desk staff. very rude teenagers with no customer service skills and if you need help they wont aknowledge your presence until they finish texting or talking to their coworker about last nights party. i ignored all of that and focused on working out and using all the amenities and classes. i loved the sauna room although it is so tiny sometimes it was full and i had to leave disappointed. one month they charged me double without my consent and i was livid!! i use a checking account for all my bills and i deposit exactly what i will spend in bills for that month. of course they overdrafted my account and by the time i noticed their mistake and called them i had extended overdrawn fees. i called them, asked to speak to the manager ( different teenagers pretended to be the manager) and they were extremely rude telling me it was not their problem that i didnt had money in my account for my overdraft fees and that they were not responsible for that and that they would only credit what they charged me by mistake. i was ok with that but the way the handled the situation was horrible!!! after all this happened i was not happy or comfortable, the kids at the front desk would give me nasty looks every time or laugh at me. as silly as it sounds it made my supposed to be relaxing work out session very uncomfortable so i decided to cancel my membership. well thats when i discovered that i had a 1 year contract!!!!! that nobody told me about!!!!! the sales kid (another muscular teenager) never mentioned that small detail! not only that!! they had my signature!!! i signed something completely different and they used my e-signature for the contract as well. that is called fraud! long story short.. i got so mad and called so many times wrote letters and complained at the bbb that they went ahead and cancelled without me having to pay the outrageous amount they were asking for!. stay away please!!! there are much better gyms out there, even the ghetto planet fitness is better ( if you live on the west side). lifetime fitness is waaay better their staff is super understanding and helpful, they have great amenities and classes and its cheaper!!"
1-star,0,"stay away from this gym!!! before you even consider signing up with them, beware that they are running a billing system that i would consider fraudulent. the electronic forms you sign do not contain the price they promised, and then they will charge you whatever they want. the manager, chris, is an a**hole that will back out from his words. i would recommend nobody to this gym."
5-star,1,"i've been at fitness works for about a year and a half now and i've never once had a complaint. when i first stopped in to check it out, i tried gpt (group personal training) with aaron and pretty much died within the first 5 minutes of the class...not to mention i couldn't walk or lift my arms for a good 3 days after. after that class, i was pretty much sold. i took gpt as well as followed the meal plan provided and lost 12 pounds in the first month and could notice my stamina and strength dramatically increase. i've been in the gym morning, noon, and night and it's never been insanely packed like other reviewers have been complaining about. there's more than enough equipment available, and even if you have to wait for a minute or two for free weight equipment, other gym members are always more than willing to share. the classes are awesome, the staff are super friendly and always helpful, and the gym overall is clean. i haven't had a chance to use the pool, but the steam room is great. not to mention the bathroom/locker room is pretty spacious. shout out to aaron for being such an awesome manager of this place. he's really the go-to guy when you're really trying to break down and accomplish your fitness goals. i've also taken personal training with nico who really knows his stuff. not only does he make you work your ass off during training sessions, but he takes the time to educate as well. i also recommend taking gpt classes with jose as well, he'll really work your ass off! if i could change one thing about this place, it would be extended hours! i work long days and frequently work the weekends. so it was always hard for me to get a decent workout in before work or on the weekends. but other than that, i've really enjoyed being a member of this gym! i unfortunately had to cancel my membership recently due to moving to a different city. i went in and had no issues at all cancelling. i was told up front that i was signing a contract for a one year membership and that once that year was up, it would be a month-to-month basis. so to all the nay-sayers stating they didn't know that they were under contract...always read the fine print, or else you'll never get anywhere in life! :)"
5-star,1,this place has great hours to work out. i can work out early in the morning before work or do a late work out. its seems like they take good care of there equipment and has a great staff. i've been to plenty of gyms that are so packed you have to wait to work out but not here. i'm thinking of signing up with a trainer to see if i can work on more definition. i'll keep you posted
5-star,1,"i like going to this gym when its not as busy, around noon to 2pm. i have been using dallas to help me with my physical training and he has been great. i really notice me getting more defined and its great getting healthy again. i am not sure why everyone here is not having a good experience here but i really enjoy the gym."
1-star,0,there is a 1 year contract the staff fail to tell you from the beginning of your membership. staff is unfriendly and rude. gym is always overcrowded and you never get a full workout. little kids running around you. teens hanging out at the machines talking.... i don't like machines but i can't use free weights because they are always being used and/or scattered in the most random places. the tv on 80% of their cardios don't work even after reported it for weeks. nothing gets fixed. my sister-in-law had a personal trainer and i guess he was somehow pocketing her monthly payments cuz when he quit she had to wait for another personal trainer to be assigned to her. after a week she was asked to fill out paperwork to start deducting money for the personal trainer. she asked the staff why they needed the info again if she was already paying and they were already deducting money for the personal trainer.... turns out the guy was getting paid off the books on his own now had my sis-in-law's bank account info. she had to deal with a huge mess at her bank to close it and get a new one. what kind of people are they hiring? this place is a joke.
1-star,0,"buyer beware! let me start off by saying the only thing worth while about this gym is the classes. if you're into classes and thats all you're looking for then this place might be okay for you. now onto everything that is completely wrong with this place. the men's locker room is dirty and smells. usually there is no soap in the soap dispensers, or paper towels. the smell within the bathroom is something of a rotting/rancid sweat smell which makes me want to vomit every time i step foot in there. the pool is dirty and i would never step foot in it. the pool water is so cloudy that you usually can't even see the bottom of it! the gym equipment is old and beat up. the workers there will claim it is new but walk through this gym and then go to another gym and look at the equipment and you will 100% see the difference. just to show you a example of the care they take in their equipment, there is a shoulder press machine that has been missing the cushion you sit on now for a solid 2 weeks, no way can anyone use this machine. they have tv's on all cardio equipment however i would say a good 40-50% don't work. also, all of the equipment is so close together that you feel like you're constantly in the way of the other patrons, this goes for all the equipment, cardio, free weights, and the weighted machines. now i feel like i'm your typical person, i go to the gym 3-4 times a week after work usually around 7. reason i mention this is b/c this place is so packed every single time i go that you cannot get a full work out in. forget about even going near the free weights, there are usually about 4-5 guys at each bench just circled around it. same sort of thing happens at all the other machines, just tons of people everywhere. some of the patrons even bring their kids! kids are literally running around the gym while you try to work out. they even allow pre-teens and very young looking teenagers to join the gym. they basically do nothing but walk around the gym and take up the machines while they talk. now the worst part of this gym, the staff. they are rude and unhelpful. i have been a member of this gym for about 2 months, i finally decided that i'm unhappy with the gym and i wished to cancel. something the staff doesn't mention when you sign up is that it is a full year contract! the only way they will let you out of the contract is if you can show proof that you're moving more than 25 miles away and even then you are forced to pay 100 dollars. i have spoken to the gm of the gym regarding my experience at the gym and basically told him all of the above as to why i am unhappy with the gym. all he told me was that there is nothing they can do and that the contract is legally binding blah blah blah even after i told him that if i knew there was a year contract i would have never signed up for this place. another example of how out of touch the staff and manager are with this gym, while speaking with the manager i asked him if he was aware of his reputation on the internet to which he responded, ""no, i don't look at whats said on the internet"". what type of person who takes their profession seriously doesn't look at whats said on the internet about their place of business and how they can improve?!?! do some simple searching and you will quickly realize i'm not the only one who is unhappy with this place. i everyone who reads this to check out this gym more than once before signing up, if you're anything like me i think you will be severely disappointed. to be honest there are 2 la fitness gyms each about 10 min. away north and south of this place, do yourself a favor and go check out either one. i am 100% certain that when you step into one of those gyms you will completely see the difference in the quality of the staff and the equipment. i'm desperate to get out of this place and it seems like my only option at this point is to ""freeze"" my account for 5 bucks a month until i can officially cancel next year. once again, be careful before signing up at this place. you will be disappointed!"
1-star,0,"super terrible! they do have a lot of classes and the membership is on the less expensive side. i, however, was not told i signed a 1 year contract! shame on me for not reading the paperwork but that is very shady not to tell someone about a 1 year contract! the gym is filthy, the people in it are ghetto and the weight area looks like what i assume a prison yard looks like teaming with inmates. most of the tv's don't work and neither does much of the equipment. the place is always packed to the gills with people no matter what time of day you go so just forget about using free weights. when i tried to cancel my membership i was told i could only do so if i provided proof that i was moving 25 miles away, was permanently disabled, or called to military duty. if i could prove any of those 3 things i could pay $99 and get out of the contract. you know, the contract i was never told about until i tried to cancel. i have asked 3 different people very nicely to just let me pay the $99 and be done with it. they won't budge. this place lacks professionalism, customer service, integrity and apparently a maintenance team. also, if you go to their fb page there are rumors floating around that the trainers secretly take videos of members working out, show the videos to other employees to make fun of the members. keep it classy fitness works!"
5-star,1,"dr. lynch is a great chiropractor. my hip went out in 2007. for 7 1/2 years, i visited numerous chiropractors in various countries across the planet. none of them realized my hip was out, not even with x-rays. dr. lynch popped it back into place after seeing what all the other people missed. his rates are amazing. my insurance copay to visit another doctor (as if i would) is more expensive than paying as a private citizen with dr. lynch. also, kayla kuhn has been a fantastic massage therapist. i never realized how tense my back muscles were until i started my therapy at floating lotus. i owe these great therapists a great deal for their excellent care and treatment. they also have great personal mannerisms that is equally friendly and professional."
5-star,1,"every instructor that i have practiced with has been very knowledgeable, supportive, and well versed in the practice of yoga. did i say friendly, everyone is friendly as well, you walk in and feel welcome."
5-star,1,i love this place ! i do yoga here 3-5 times a week. i'm on the monthly unlimited plan and it's very easy and convenient. i have also had the acupuncture and that was wondrous. i dedinelty recommend this place ! i've also had a massage and that was just as good =)
5-star,1,"i had never done yoga before but had been wanting to try. floating lotus offers a free community class sunday mornings, so it was perfect to try it out! instructor dawn was very welcoming but not overbearing at all and it was easy to join in, even for a first timer. my boyfriend who has some yoga experience also enjoyed it. this particular class used the gong which was pretty cool and you could feel the vibrations. overall, the class was refreshing and we both felt energized for the rest of the day! will be back. the location is also nice, as it's in downtown mesa and we enjoyed walking around main st for a bit after the class."
5-star,1,"love this yoga studio & natural healing center! such a bright, clean, and cheery place. the people are so welcoming. highly recommended!"
5-star,1,"i was witness to a minor argument at an unassociated business near floating lotus, and to see normally credible contributors use yelp as a personal flame thrower was disconcerting. yelp is here as an assessment tool for the quality of a business, not for personal vendetta. i love and use yelp to know where to spend my money, and i used yelp to find floating lotus for healing and health, and i stand by the positive results i have received from the owner and floating lotus. personal skirmishes ""off-the-clock"" should not be the measure of a business. the owner is a consummate professional and has never shown any bias based upon sexual orientation, and i will continue to patronize this business."
1-star,0,the teachers here were great. i loved the atmosphere and never had a compliant about the yoga. the owner on the other hand is a crook. please never give this guy your credit card. i was on a monthly plan and had to cancel a few months ago. i went in a turned in the required letter stating i was canceling my membership. since then money has been taken out of account three times. i finally had to call my bank and have floating lotus blocked from removing anymore money. i called and left multiple messages trying to get this fixed and never once had my calls returned. when i finally did get him on the phone he was very rude. please save your money and take your business elsewhere.
5-star,1,i've taken several classes at this yoga studio with different instructors. i am never disappointed! the variety in the classes keep me engaged and wanting more. the instructors are absolutely wonderful and push me out of my comfort zone while always maintaining a grounded and peaceful space to practice. the studio itself has beautiful energy and light. this is the studio you want if you are looking for not only a physical workout but also a place to add to your spiritual practice.
4-star,1,"what a wonderful studio! being new to yoga, i felt incredibly comfortable there with karen's comforting style. i plan on returning to try out more classes, the atmosphere was relaxing and the yoga room is spacious."

5-star,1,"i started with a generous groupon offer about two months ago, looking for a chance to try yoga as other exercise options are severely limited due to health concerns. love the variety of classes from really beginner to gentle nudges to challenge yourself; there are power yoga, sculpt and tone and zumba classes for those who really want to rock out! too many great instructors to mention; though there's been some turnover recently, but hey, life happens to all of us. membership options were clearly explained and prices are the best in the area that i've found. one of my friends joined me for a class recently and was warmly welcomed by staff and instructor; thanked for coming and i was thanked for inviting her. love the ambiance and love the philosophy: that this is your practice, do your best practice today and don't worry about comparing it to other people's or even to your own previous efforts. i like that, since mine is a bit hampered in spots by physical disability. i would highly recommend to anyone looking for a studio to make their home. construction issues on main right now due to light rail install will be a pain thru the summer, but i wouldn't let that stop you!"
5-star,1,"first time yoga student first time at this studio received a nice warm welcome from steve, my instructor kai was amazing i never knew you could sweat this much doing yoga really impressed, the studio and mats were clean and the atmosphere was relaxing i will definitely go again!"
5-star,1,"awesome studio, instructors, owner and medium for yoga on all levels. sean is a particularly capable, experienced, thoughtful and calm professional instructor. ignore anything in previous reviews about the owner and nicole spat. that was about the difference between an ashram (not) and studio (yes) and then ethical professionalism (yes) vs. unethical business sabatoge and stealing (not). i have been involved in yoga for 15 yrs from seattle to phoenix, from indian and bali trained instructors to original newbies such as myself, and this is in the top five of 20+ experiences. plus downtown mesa is up and coming and great to check out. check out floating lotus. you have a good chance that it will work for you on at least one level : )"
1-star,0,"i began going to floating lotus on on of their groupon passes. i had a fantastic teacher, nicole, who has since opened her own studio radiant love. the owner of floating lotus, dr. lynch, is outright rude. i cancelled my monthly membership after nicole left, but continued to go in once a week for an organic farm box delivery program that i really enjoy. some times dr. lynch has invited me to come back for classes, and i have declined. today, dr. lynch called me a very demeaning sexist name when i came in to pick up my package. how he expects to run a yoga studio while being demeaning and rude to those who walk through the doors is nonsense. practice yoga. practice love."
5-star,1,i tried this place out because of a groupon deal and loved the varied classes and the warm instructors. non-judgmental and friendly atmosphere.
5-star,1,i started yoga in april with a groupon to the floating lotus thinking i would use the groupon and that would be it. i fell in love with the studio// the instructors & the friendly attitude of everyone there. i feel at home when i walk in and after each practice i am refreshed and ready for the rest of my day. the instructors make each class unique// guide you through the poses and make you feel comfortable. i would recommend this to anyone.
4-star,1,"just got a $10 groupon for 10 classes, what an amazing deal is that!?! great location in downtown mesa and the room is spacious with perfect lighting. with so many classes available i can always turn to this place to get my yoga fill."
5-star,1,"after 2 major abdominal surgeries in the past year, i was advised to stop weight training and attend a yoga class. lucky for me a fellow classmate, erica is the director of yoga and teaches at floating lotus. after one of erica's classes i knew i was hooked, 25 classes later not only do i feel fantastic, i am beginning to see the benefits of a yoga practice :-) not only is the studio spacious and inviting it's the best value i've found. i didn't need a groupon to convince me i had found a home. leaving la fitness was the best decision i've made. i appreciate the serenity and positive energy i feel when entering the studio to begin my practice. i appreciate the high quality and passion of instruction each teacher brings to class. i feel like every teacher is a personal trainer dedicated to helping their students enhance the quality of their practice with each class. there have been recent changes with teachers and scheduling which have only improved the exceptional experience i have enjoyed. my daughter and i attend classes 3 to 4 times a week and enjoy the friendships we've made, while i continue to refer family and friends. if you are new to yoga or just looking for a new yoga home, you don't have to look any further. i highly recommend dropping in, meeting the amazing staff and experiencing the floating lotus difference."
3-star,0,"after getting a groupon deal, i've attended several different classes at this studio - all led by nicole. the studio itself is nice, with lots of ambient and natural light. but nicole really made the class and her classes were always full! i was contemplating getting a monthly auto-pay pass, but now that nicole has left the studio, i find myself wanting to find out where she is and see if i can follow her there. she was that good!"
1-star,0,"is it possible to give negative stars?!? a friend introduced me to floating lotus and i loved it! nicole is the best, most amazing instructor!!! i signed up for the auto-pay plan and needed to stop it for a few months to help a family member with some health issues/bills so i called steve (owner) and requested to cancel the auto-pay. i could not believe the way steve treated me... he began to yell at me (i am not exaggerating either, he yelled at me!!) and challenge the reason that i was leaving. an instructor had left the studio the same day i called so steve assumed i lying and was really leaving to follow the instructor when that was not the case at all. when nicole found out the way i was treated she contacted me and smoothed things over. it was only because of nicole that i refrained from posting a negative yelp review; i did not want the negative actions of steve to affect her. i am writing this review now because i have learned that nicole has left the studio due to steve's never ending negativity. i work way too hard for my money to support a business that in this manner. i will never again support this establishment! be aware! his groupon deals are great and will get you in the door but please consider the type of person that you would be supporting if you support his studio!!"
5-star,1,"i bought a groupon for this class and it is fantastic! i absolutely love the variety in the classes. nicole is an excellent teacher, she is very friendly. this yoga is so much better than the bikram yoga and its kind that i tried before. it not only helps you tone, but more importantly relieves you of stress and you go back, being full of love, life and energy. highly recommend this place. :)"
5-star,1,i bought a groupon for this studio and went to classes several times a week for a month. all the staff were friendly and addressed me by name after just a couple sessions. most of the classes i attended were beginning/intermediate and they were always willing to work with anyone regardless of their level. i'm not sure if there would be enough classes each week for someone at the advanced level to attend but it is a fantastic studio for those at the beginner/intermediate level.
5-star,1,"took empowerment class with nicole, was great. she allowed you to safely challenge yourself in an atmosphere of care. massage from michelle, which was amazing! one of the most beautiful, caring massages i have ever received. i highly recommend treating yourself to a healing experience w michelle"
5-star,1,"i have taken about 5 classes now at floating lotus. the yoga basics class taught by nicole is the best yoga class i have ever taken (i have practiced for 2 years and all types, basic, bikram, yin, flow ect..) the studio is clean and really spacious, though the yoga basics class fills the room. i have to bet it is because of the instructor nicole. she makes me both laugh and cry (in a good way) with her teaching and inspiration. it is the best 90 mins of my day most weeks. i can't recommend this place highly enough for that reason alone. like other reviewers stated, the owner steve is also friendly and caring. i forgot my punch card recently and he had no problem trusting i would mark it off on my next visit. this type of business practice along with nicole will keep me coming 2-3 times a week."
4-star,1,"great newer yoga studio in mesa. like a few other people i discovered floating lotus via groupon, but even after my deal is up i'm sure i'll come back. the studio itself is beautiful. steve is always super friendly whenever you check in and the instructors are wonderful. floating lotus is very welcoming and not at all pretentious like some other studios in the valley. i look forward to them growing and expanding their class schedule!"
5-star,1,"thank you floating lotus for an amazing yoga class while i was visiting from san francisco! i was pleasantly surprised that the space was so peaceful - just what i was looking for - a little sanctuary for this busy mom. coming from san francisco, you can be a tough critic on yoga places (although we strive for no judgment in yoga, right :0) so, yes, i loved the space and my flow class. thank you and see you next time i'm in town."
5-star,1,"beautiful yoga studio located in the heart of downtown mesa, az. i go there mainly for chiropractic adjustments. dr. lynch is amazing! really worth checking this place out!"
5-star,1,i have never done yoga before but consider myself relatively fit (for 50!) izzy was a great instructor and let us all move at our own pace. i was surprised at what i could accomplish with her guidance. most importantly i felt amazing the rest of the day and can't wait for my next session. great studio and great team!
5-star,1,"i am really enjoying yoga at this studio! i'm a bit hesitant to shell out $$ for a gym or yoga membership without getting to try it out first. so i was thrilled when floating lotus offered a groupon for 15 classes. i've been to 7 or 8 classes so far. nikki has been the instructor for probably half of the classes i've taken. her verbal cues are top-notch! her voice calmly keeps the focus on the mental & physical element of the practice as she guides you thru each pose. i've also taken a class or two with jackie, shella & katie. each instructor has their individual style & works to accommodate all levels. they have mats, blankets, blocks & straps to use as needed."
4-star,1,"i had been looking for a yoga studio and came upon this place when it offered a groupon. i've been to four or five classes here so far and like what i see so far. the yoga studio itself is really nice (and the blue ceiling is nice to stare at when i need to distract myself from the pain of a bridge position or something). i've taken classes with nickie, alexandra, and katie. all three were good about accommodating different experience levels, correcting positions unobtrusively, asking about prior injuries, and offering alternative stretches. this may be because the studio just opened and is trying to adjust its course selection to demand, but the classes tend toward beginning and intermediate levels (which is fine for my rigid self). i did see a mention of possible level 3-4 classes on the website, however."
5-star,1,"just joined free range. one of the hardest training weeks i've had in a very long time. great fun, great people, awesome trainers and equipment. i wish i committed earlier. lots of fit people here too!"
5-star,1,i came here 2 days in a row as a drop-in from out of town (uk actually). everyone was so friendly and welcoming from the moment i walked in. i am still fairly new to crossfit and they took good care of me. the workout was good and the equipment was great. next time i am in phoenix i will definitely come here! luke the owner was great too.
5-star,1,absolutely excellent service! this gym truly cares about their community and takes care of anyone who steps foot into their gym. trainers were 100% attentive and were clearly highly educated in crossfit workouts and methodology. will definitely be returning.
5-star,1,"dropped in without calling. very nice people. was introduced the everyone right away. crazy friendly and busy 5:30 class. good instruction, great workout. will drop in again when visiting phx."
5-star,1,"i was in town for work and wanted to get a workout in. i'm found them nearby and i have to say that, they were very welcoming. this was one of the best boxes i have been in. good group of guys and the trainers were very helpful. next time i'm in town i will for sure stop by again."
5-star,1,"i was visiting my in-laws from out of town and found free range to be about 3 blocks away from their place. i looked at all of the yelp reviews and was actually looking to go somewhere else because free range was not reviewed many times, but they were the only place that on their website had the schedule posted and a class to attend at noon. but man! i was very glad to go there and drop in. the entire staff greeted me and was very nice. i arrived 30 minutes early and they told me to make myself comfortable and do whatever i liked to get warmed up before the class started. lucas was the coach for the noon class and he was very skilled on the movements for that class and looking at their leaderboards, he was no joke himself. and to top it off, they had rogue everything! rigs, blocks, squat racks, bars, plates... all rogue. will def drop by here again for my next visit! pro's: great staff that is knowledgable and friendly, latest and top notch equipment, clean and air conditioned facility, competitive athletes within the class. con's: i'd have to say the only con i saw was that the class was slightly crowded, but that just means that they're doing it right! it was basically just full enough to where people weren't strapped for space, but we were snug ;)"
5-star,1,"i started my crossfit journey at free range crossfit in april of 2013. my first free basics course with the owner, matt, was a rough challenge, but matt did an excellent job explaining all the moves and proper form to me as i was completely foreign to weight lifting. in 4 months, i met a lot of fantastic people, learned so much from each coach and lost 20 lbs! as a newbie, they were always attentive to my form and i never felt in danger of hurting myself. now that i'm back in phoenix, i've tested out several phoenix crossfit boxes and still can't find one that compares to the charismatic community and passionate trainers at free range crossfit. for anyone considering doing crossfit in genergal, regardless of which box you choose: ''you don't have to be good to start, you have to start to be good.''"
5-star,1,"free range crossfit is awesome. i've had some buddies that did crossfit and all of them recommended this place because of the owner/trainer matt. i was getting bored at regular chain gyms and felt i wasn't getting any better. i finally got up the courage to check it out. right off the bat i was hooked to it. i signed up my second time there. there was no pressure or anything. i have been going to free range for about 4 months and in that little time everything has changed for me. i feel stronger, healthier and better at anything now. everyone here encourages you and helps you in every way to help you reach your goals. thanks to matt and all the people here i'm in the best shape i've and have gained many new friends. i recommend this place to everyone!"
5-star,1,"i had been doing training programs & bootcamps for a few years, lifting at the big box gyms, but could never really find that next level of fitness i had been searching for. a friend and i decided after doing the tough mudder one year that we should try this ""crossfit thing"". it was only going to be for a month, but half way through we decided that we should give it another month to really see if we liked it. very quickly we both found that not only were we addicted to the results we were seeing physically, but the positive, engaging, goal setting, competitive enviornment was something new and leaving it started to beome blashemous. there are a quite a number of gyms around the phoenix metro area, but what i think makes a ""box"" unique is two fold, one is the owner and two are the people who rally around eachother and push eachother to perform better everyday. the owner, matthew lucas, brings a postitve, healthy, encouraging presence to the incredible community that he has created and is watching it grow right before his very eyes. now, having been a memeber for 7 months, i have put my body through an incredible change physically, mentally & spiritually. i have pushed myself to limits i never thought were possible and continue to surprise myself everyday! matt's passion for his craft of ""forging elite athletes"" and more importantly his deep love of nutrition (www.foodee.com) and food have helped to create an irresistible atmosphere that engulfs everyone that walks in the door. free range is more than a place to do crossfit, its my place to push myself to new pr's, set new goals, encourage others and be a mentor to those that are just starting out. if you're wondering if it's all it's hyped up to be, the answer is ""duh!"" i would reccomend free range to anyone that is looking for a way to improve their health, physique, nutrition and overall outlook on life."
5-star,1,free range crossfit was great! i was in town for a week and really enjoyed woding with everyone at frc. the programming was well thought out and the coaching was top notch. thanks matt and everyone at frc!
5-star,1,"i came by for a drop-in visit, and matt hooked it up. super helpful encouragement and instruction, really nice facilities, a real positive vibe - this is a great crossfit box. if i lived in the area, i would join. definitely."
5-star,1,definitely a place that will make you feel welcome as soon as you walk in. matt takes the time to give each person individual attention and whether you're just starting out or been at it awhile he can help you improve.
5-star,1,"great crossfit gym! programs are geared to help you master crossfit staple moves. not just metcon stuff. i didnt think i could do a kip pullup but now its a skill i can say i can do without hesitation. location is perfect and very quiet. the owner matt is not only a great coach but a top notch competitor. his attention to detail and friendly nature makes the environment at the gym very conducive to achieving your goals. the gym has a community feel to it, members are very supportive at the same time competitive to help you attain pr's. i consider these people my friends and we help and cheer each other to help attain personal goals. i'm actually new to crossfit and have not been an athlete all my life but free range makes it easy for anyone to get into this crossfit thing. you'll love the benefits and most of all overall health."
1-star,0,"this gym has unsafe workout spaces without any signs or warnings not to workout there! i fell and could have seriously hurt myself with the slippery floors in the equipment area where the bosu balls, plyo boxes, step benches etc are located! when i asked about this i was told ""nobody ever works out there-people only go there to stretch"". the last thing anyone needs is a dangerous workout area! i should have known from the other reviews posted about this facility. not up to ymca standards! i travel around the country and have not visited a worse y."
5-star,1,"my kids and i love going to this facility. the child care workers have always been great with my kids (2&3). and it's so nice to know that they are in good hands while i get my workout in! all the classes i have tried are wonderful! renee is an amazing instructor! i've tried a variety of classes from yoga, cardio kickboxing to barre classes and they've all rocked! my only criticism is the swimming lessons we signed up for was mommy & me and the instructor didn't smile, wasn't kid friendly, and wasn't even adult friendly. after 6 weeks my kids are still not comfortable in the water. i'll be teaching them myself. i suggest they review their mommy and me classes, shorten the time from 40 mins to 20 mins and actually have fun & productive classes. 40 mins for babies and toddlers is too long to hold their attention."
1-star,0,"we were going to the y for the swimming lesson. we took three sets of swimming lesson. the first issue is the merry go round of teachers. for each set of the lesson, we end up with two or three different teachers. the second issue the teacher would tell you end of every class your kid is doing wonderfully until the last lesson they tell you they are entirely unprepared to go to the next lesson and do not tell you why. i wanted to know if he is having an issue with something so we can work on it before the next lesson. i feel they are not honest about how your child is doing during lessons also the continually changes teacher does not help either. the third thing they are going to tell you that they need private lessons, charge you for them and never set up the lessons. then when you want to get your money back, you going to have to go to the location and fill out the form to get your money back. they can take your money, but they make it very difficult to get it back also, this y seem completely disorganized. they all seem clueless about what is going on the location. also, i find a lot of the employees are unhelpful and rude. the sad part of all this is, i pay a lot of money for these lessons, and i still do not know if he learned anything at all."
1-star,0,"i joined this gym thinking it was going to be a great experience. they have a heated pool and a large lap pool; however, good luck being able to use either. the heated pool is used for swimming lessons and the lap pool is always shut down to one lane for the local swim teams. they used to leave one or two lanes open to accommodate the patrons who just come in to use the pool to swim. now they've taken those lanes over to have swimming lessons for all of lorain counties children. so much for courtesy. i will not be joining any more ymca facility ever again. thanks for retuning my call and email. charity (executive director)."
1-star,0,"one of the worst gyms i've ever been to. all employees are unhelpful, rude, and condescending. machines break and don't get fixed for months. you're unable to check out trx cables unless you pay for a class-even if you already know how to use it. the setup is just bizarre. there is a running track right thru the middle of the gym, so you will always be running into runners during your workouts. all cardio machines, tiny weight room. does not have more advanced machines at all. kids running everywhere. trainers actually sit while they ""train"" their clients. way over-priced for the value you receive. the pool is disgusting, the sauna fits 4 people max, and the hot tub goes down fairly regularly, and also has absolutely no ventilation. hours during the winter are terrible. and guess what? during the summer, when you would expect them to be open longer, they actually close earlier! great for kids, parents, and old people. which i guess is what they are going for. so in that case, keep it up ymca. you're doing great!"
3-star,0,"there's a lot going on at this facility. my review specifically and only pertains to the fitness area(s). for a ymca, it's probably about as nice as i've seen- but it better be seeing that's it's pretty new. there is plenty of cardio equipment and weight machines that are of medium to high quality. the clientele is generally courteous. for me, their is one major problem- wonky layout. there has absolutely got to be a better way to organize this area. 1. the free weight room is crammed into a cave and often too overcrowded as a result. there is only one power/squat rack. people are side stepping and running into each other in there. 2. a third of the cardio equipment is set up in weird patterns facing each other. while i'm busting my ass, there's nothing i love more than to be giving the ""eye of the tiger"" to a stranger right across from me. 3. another third of the cardio equipment has a wonderful view of... half a basketball court? meanwhile, half of the weight machines are set up to provide wonderful views of people's backsides while they are on said cardio equipment. thank god for yoga pants! 4. meanwhile, the other half of the weight machines are also set up to provide perfect views of people's backsides on different cardio equipment. 5. the entire window area (by the pools) is underutilized. the punching station thing is hardly used. something more needs to be done with the entire floor space here. maybe move some of the dumbbells out of the cave and into this place?"
1-star,0,"the membership fees are higher than other gyms with more equipment and others have free classes.all classes here cost extra. this gym is more geared towards children with little ones all over, lots of noise and clogged halls with kids everywhere. the design is poor as their track runs right through the weight room and i have had many near collisions with runners. the hot tub is closed often and pool closed due to events as well. getting in and out due to the location so far off the road and a busy exit ramp can take 15 minutes alone.then the front desk is another bottleneck with people trying to get checked in pay for classes etc."
2-star,0,too crowded. too many kids. weight room is tiny in comparison to the rest of the facility. many high school football types standing around trying to look cool and chatting. won't let us old folks use the benches. time to find a new gym.
5-star,1,"i have worked out on and off at glove game for a couple years. the reason it is on and off is because i have moved back in forth from arizona to new york. i have done boot camps, and individual training sessions. marty is my guy, and i would never cheat on him with another trainer. i'm sure the others are qualified, but i'm high maintenance. i saw great physical results in terms of strength and endurance from the bootcamp, which was my goal. i also learned some cool boxing moves during my 1:1 training, however after sparring a couple times and getting my ass kicked by a 50 yo man i have decided to put my fighting days behind me. turns out i prefer punching bags to getting hit in the face. i had a sheet where i recorded my weight, and certain stats on a weekly basis which i enjoyed doing. 1:1 training is as good as any high end gym personal trainer, and costs significantly less. i only communicate with marty, so i have never scheduling conflicts. i love this place and i have brought a few friends in for work outs. they always walk out smiling and nauseous."
5-star,1,"i love this place! i have been going for about 5 months and i am never bored....i drive 40 minutes to get there about 3 times a week and cant wait to get there. ihave never like to work out but now i have found the right place for me ""game glove boxing"". if you try it you will love it too. my girlfriends go with me and they like the atmosphere and how confortable you feel while working out. this is not your normal workout! love it, love it, love it~!"
2-star,0,"i have to agree with this comment. my husband and i went for a training together. it is to be 30 min.... the time that we read our contacts etc was put towards our 30 min..... if this is the case, let us know to come early.....our trainer seemed utterly board. he did not want to be there, kept checking our time. as soon as the clock hit our 30 min mark (we worked out for about 15-20 min max) he stopped us and went to his desk to get his money... not a welcome feeling. we felt they wanted our money and wanted us out. we have been to other gyms where the passion is there from the get go and the trainers take pride in what they do. maybe it was an off day for him.. but we were not impressed and unfortunately will be looking else where."
1-star,0,a/c hasn't worked in weeks. i decided to skip asking someone in charge about it because i really don't care to hear excuses. i just want it fixed so i don't almost pass out every time i box. ** michael is still awesome though. gives a great workout. **
1-star,0,"super disappointed!! i was incredible upset to have received bad customer service at this place. i was so desperate to like it that after the first instance of a poor experience i gave them a second and third chance, they failed miserably. with a week's advance i set up a consultation for my boyfriend and i to train. the owner gave me the name of my trainer and said he would contact us to confirm. i never heard from the trainer, so i called the morning of my appointment to see if i was still in the schedule and the owner assured me he'd get everything straightened out and have that same trainer contact me. when the guy finally called me he informed me that he didn't work on the day i had specified and muttered an apology before hanging up (strike one). i decided to try and contact the owner again to see if we could fix the poor experience and get me in the gym. i, no joke, called the location ten times during their business hours that same day and not one person picked up the phone (strike two). i figured it'd probably be good for me to cool off, so i waited another day before contacting glove game. a gentleman answered and i told him i wanted to speak to the owner in regards to rectifying the poor customer service that had been dished out. he replied that he'd let him know it was urgent and that i would get a call soon. i never heard from the damn place (strike three). what does it take to get some good service around here? i have read about all the raving reviews and was so sad that i didn't get to experience the company's ""good side""."
5-star,1,"hooray for my 200th review! i wanted to make my 200th kind of special so i chose my newest favorite place. don't get me wrong though, i kind of hate this place too. my reasoning: you work. you work damn hard. and that's the whole point. harrison does not go easy on me because i'm a girl and i sometimes whine. he kicks my ass and then i say thank you! kind of sexy. everytime i leave, my arms and legs are shaking, i'm sweating my face off and i'm thinking nasty thoughts about how i'm never coming back, but then i find myself texting him the next day to see when i come back and train. each time i come to the gym, i learn something new and i get just a little bit better than the last time. and he's great at mixing up the routine, some days we focus on arms and other days on legs. nothing is more satisfying than defying your pain and growing your resistance and willpower. it's hard and it hurts and if you keep doing it, you and you alone get better and better. it's a lifestyle and i'm never giving it up."
4-star,1,"my boyfriend & i train here with patrique. the couple who boxes together stays together. :) our trainer is cool, flexible & motivating. he pushes us, but isn't a jerk. we do wish the gym was a little cleaner though."
1-star,0,"i'd give them zero stars if possible... my girlfriend and i got the groupon and attempted to call them a few weeks prior to the expiration (i know we shouldn't have waited so late, but forgot). nevertheless, we only received their voicemail every time and both took turns calling them. i explained that we were concerned about the expiration date nearing and would like a call back. we never received a return call and i even called the day the groupon expired one last time. very unhappy with this waste of money and this company. i can understand that they may have been overwhelmed with the number of calls and business from the groupon, but that does not excuse them from not returning calls... i will tell anyone that i know and asks to avoid this company. at the very least it would be nice to have a refund of our money, but i'll just chalk it up as a lesson learned."
5-star,1,what do i even say! just finished my first session here and i can already tell that i am going to be a sore girl tomorrow! john was awesome and very patient with my very out of shape self. i'd highly recommend this to anyone- all of the trainers seem great. looking forward to another ass whooping on my next session!
2-star,0,"this place is so disorganized. when i called to make an appointment on the main line, i was told to contact the trainer directly, so i left a message on his cell. by the end of the next day i still hadn't received a call back, so i called the main line again where i was able to make an appointment. why couldn't i do this the first time? and each session is only 30 minutes, but without fail 10 of them consisted of waiting for my trainer, henry, to finish with the client prior to me, then waiting for him to find and roll the wrist wraps to put on me and my husband. perhaps they need to hire someone part-time to clean up all the papers and roll the wraps every once in a while. the actual training was too intense for me to the point of hardly being able to breathe (i generally do low-key workouts). however, it wasn't enough for my husband who also has a personal trainer. he was hoping to do more boxing and less cardio, which was too mellow for him. in the end, it wasn't worth the hassle of attempting to drive over there from phoenix only to work out for 20 minutes."
5-star,1,i've been going to glove game boxing for a couple months now. i love it! rory never fails to challenge me and push me to the limits. best money i've ever spent.
4-star,1,"i was gifted a groupon for 10 one-on-one boxing session, which said to call the gym, schedule and appointment and mention my groupon. i had some trouble getting a response--i called and left a couple messages and i sent an email. i received two calls a couple days later. i got the impression that there isn't one person who books sessions (i later found out that the trainers work independently). i was a little nervous to start this type of training, but after peter's warm welcome i began to feel more at ease. i let him know that i don't feel comfortable having anyone punching toward my face or body, and he promised that he'd be extra careful when the time came. after wrapping my hands up peter had me warm up. the first time i did a simple block-running exercise, where i discovered i'm not as agile as i thought! the second session i did pushups veeeerrry slowly in three different hand positions. incredibly effective in getting my heart rate up. the first session is all about technique. i learned the proper way to stand, cross and jab, and how to hold my body. it's a lot harder than it looks! i was instructed to ice anything that ached. my hands were a little sore the next day, so i took a couple advil and iced away. the second session we actually got to go in the boxing ring! i had been practicing; pete could tell, and he was excited about this. glove game is not your typical fancy-shmancy scottsdale gym. it's a place where you can be yourself and where your trainer pushes you to the limit. there is this energy that happens when you're training; you are focusing so hard on your body's movements that the world disappears around you--only you and the trainer exist. i'm very much looking forward to my next 8 sessions, and the ones i intend to purchase in the future."
5-star,1,"i like many of the others got a groupon to try this place. i wish i would have got the 10 session groupon but i got the 5 session. i've been to 2 sessions thus far and am seeing results already! the 30 minutes goes by so fast and was only initimidating the first time as i was brand new to boxing. my trainer is great and i know he sees the pain in my eyes but keeps pushing without being a punk. the sessions are normally $20 each, and they recommend 2x a week. after my groupon is over, i plan on going once a week. a friend of mine is a personal trainer and charges $25 so $20 is pretty reasonable. i recommend running by the canal as a warm up and remember to stretch before and after!! i wish i would have stretched more after my last session... it would make normal bodily movements easier."
5-star,1,"had a 5 session lesson through a groupon with my trainer pete. i've been doing american/muay thai kickboxing for about 10 years, and realized my boxing game needed quite a bit of work after going through my lessons with pete. in 30 minutes, he had me sweating and tired, arms on fire, and realizing that as good as you think you are, you can always get better (and that there is always someone out there better than you!). great workout, friendly group of guys."
5-star,1,bought the 5 session groupon here for my daughter. she had her sessions with mike and henry and they were both great! they worked her out good and she got along with both of them. it's been a great experience for her so far and she wants to continue going!
5-star,1,"i have been much more active over the past nine months between half marathon training, multiple weekly zumba sessions, and the occasional yoga class - just after just two sessions with pete at glove game boxing, i have had my ass handed to me. i purchased a groupon for 10 sessions. these are 1:1 sessions with a trainer, 30 minutes each. it is amazing how challenging 30 minutes seems when going through the drills. jumping rope, medicine ball, 3 push-up positions, sit-ups, dips - and that's the warm up. strap on the hand wraps, slip on the boxing gloves and it is time to hit the ring. jab, cross, upper cut and hook - punching the trainer's hands, working the heavy bag, ducking punches. whew. i am tired just typing it. after a session my arms are jello and a water bottle is difficult to lift. the gym is located on the top floor in the same building at fnb, cowboy ciou, and lee's cream liqueur. typically each session is $20 - you will definitely get a workout!"
5-star,1,"just had my first appointment with marty and it was one of the coolest things ever. this place is legit, it's centrally located, and they clearly know what they're doing. i've run in triathlons before and thought i was in decent shape, but he showed me otherwise inside of about 3 minutes. this is a lot of fun, and you get all the other things that come with it too like confidence, toning, etc."
5-star,1,"glove game boxing is awesome!! this is a great place to get a kick-butt workout and learn new skills at the same time. rory is excellent to work with - he is patient and attentive, and makes the workout fun. i look forward to going, and feel so great when i am done. it is a perfect way to relieve stress. everyone who works there is friendly, and the whole place has a great vibe!!!! i highly recommend trying glove game boxing."
5-star,1,"i just love it. it's a great place that makes you feel right at home. i hate going to gyms, actually i hate working out in front of anyone, but i feel so comfortable here that i don't worry about it. i know that they're just trying to get me to the fitness level that i want to achieve. rory, my one on one trainer, is amazing. he seems to know just how much he can push me and how much i can really do even though at times i don't even believe it. the boxing lessons are fun and i love the fact that i'm working out and learning something new. the 30 minute workouts are just the right amount of time. the prices are fair and reasonable. the owner is just a delight and all the trainers are professional and great. glove game boxing packs a lot of heat within it's wall. go check it out when you get a chance. for only $20 you can get a trial session and that to me is a pretty sweet deal."
5-star,1,"small gym but this why its called an ""express"" gym! very friendly staff! bought a 12 month contract for $19.99 a month for my husband and i, added on $10 more for tanning a month! much cheaper tanning than anywhere in vegas, beds aren't that great but if you just want to keep your tan or get some color, it'll do! never over crowded and always able to get on any machine! love this place!"
3-star,0,"the duchess of golds? i guess it's time to finally write a review. if you're pressed for time or just don't feel like driving to losee this gym is your best bet. don't expect a mega gym or classes here. it's more of an ""express"" location. truth be told, i'm a lvac girl but my boyfriend likes me to join him at the gym so i happily oblige. but if you're in the mood for cardio & lifting heavy things this place gets the job done. with that being said, it does manage to have the cardio cinema and tanning room (which personally i don't need to use, i'm tan all year long lol). the lockers rooms are small but like i said this location is basically the bare minimum as far as gyms go. not complaining though, i've never had to fight for a machine here (i'm a lover not a fighter) and the staff has always been friendly. bottom line, if you're in a rush and don't have high expectations...you've met your match."
4-star,1,"after coming to this gym for almost a year, i'm actually a little surprised by the low star reviews. when i first arrived to sign up for my membership i was a little shocked by how small it seemed but it didn't take long to see how much this place had to offer. at my first appointment, i was offered a physical assessment. insert heavy breathing and a lot of sweating. the trainer was amazing. he offered suggestions with a meal plan and a physical routine and then he put me to work for the next hour. since i'm in overall decent shape, i didn't see the need for the full time personal trainer but these guys know there stuff. this location has so much to offer. there is the cardio cinema upstairs. inside there are stationary bikes, treadmills and ellipticals. the movies are a range in classics to movies that have just been out a few years. despite the sign in the gym, the website isn't typically updated with the month to month listing of movies. but guys make sure to clean your equipment in the cardio cinema when you're done. just because it's dark doesn't mean we can't see you not clean it. they also offer the kids club for a small fee. the ladies that run the place are great! my little gingers love them! just make sure you fill out the paperwork and have your kids shot records. and now the kids club requires a 24 hour notice for all appointments, so plan ahead! the tanning is also nice. i've added it in with my monthly package to get the best deal. they have 2 stand up beds and they always seems available. just let the front desk know and they will set your bed up and you are good to get your tan on. though this location is a smaller one, it is packed with tons of equipment. the upstairs is full of cardio equipment, most having ipod hookups and tv's. so bring your headphones. the downstairs is full of weights and other random machines that i have no need for but are always occupied. like any other gym this place gets full after normal work hours and then people complain. it is a smaller gym but if you want to get right on certain equipment don't come monday through friday between 5 and 7. it's not worth it. there are other gold's locations near by but this one is conveniently located in the aliante area."
1-star,0,"always too packed, the trainers here act like they and their clients have enough room to do crossfit workouts in this tiny gym. only 1 bench press, 1 squat rack for a golds?!?! i can only workout out on weird hours because it is just way to small and busy all the time especially from 3-9pm. the kids day care thing is a joke and they should not have even included it because it just takes up space. i think it should be removed to allow for more gym equipment. there are never any paper towels in the mens locker room which is also tiny and it does not have enough lockers. and the worst part is the water fountains are never cold, always luke warm at best. its a sloppy designed gym but it is conveniently close to my house so it gets one star. golds is just another big name gym trying to rip you off now... after you sign up they don't care about you at all."
1-star,0,"i just finished up my vip 1 week free pass, so i went in to sign up this morning. when i got the pass, i explained that i only needed one month to work out. i just finished grad school at unlv in may and no longer have access to their gym and am moving out of state in july, so i just needed a gym for the month of june. i was told this would not be a problem and that i would be able to sign up with no contract probably for around $15 a month. well, this morning i was told i had to pay an enrollment fee, $24 a month, and then a cancellation fee for cancelling within the first 6 months of my contract. a month would cost me $100. i told the man helping me that i was not told this when i first came in, and he said he would talk to shane who gave me my free pass and see if he would just extend it or try to work out something else for me for a month. he let me work out and when i left, shane said ""well there's nothing i can do for you so good luck."" this is the guy who told me it would be $15 a month. good luck on your customer service skills, shane, because they pretty much suck. update: they called me yesterday (3 weeks after the above happened) and offered me another free week pass. i refused...i don't really see the point as my wedding is this week and after that i am leaving vegas. too little too late."
5-star,1,the gym is very clean. the staff is so nice and welcoming. sariah was so helpful when i set up my personal training sessions! i love this location.
1-star,0,"be careful of this gym.the staff is not well trained in customer service and does not seem to know that eye rolling when taking to customers is not acceptable. also, the gym is not very clean, and there are rarely any cleaners available to wipe down machines. the day care is okay if you don't mind teenagers who care more about gossiping than watching the children."
3-star,0,"although this is new golds gym with newer equipment it is relatively small club. there is a kids center, upstairs cardio equipment of about 6 treadmills, 3 stairmasters, 3-4 ellipticals and a few bikes with a couple ab roller machines. then in the media cardio room where movies are shown, yes movies, in a big screen projection, there are several more treadmills, bikes, and ellipticals. its interesting bc it a dark theater room and your trying to do cardio, doesn't work for me personally but cool thought. on the main floor are machines and free weights. the free weight area is small with only 1 leg press, 1 smithmachine, 2 bench's and a few free bench's/inclines. dumbbells are a full rack from 5-100lbs. full cable machine rack, roman chair, calf machine and several machines for all body parts. they do have jump boxes and a few other functional exercise equipment. i like it bc its close to my house but overall i select which workouts i perform here due to limited space and weight/machine selection. i would give it 4 stars but the size of this gym is just too small to warrant it."
5-star,1,"i typically always go really early in the morning so i never have an issue with it being over crowded. a few machines have been broken recently, but were fixed within a week. i have two small children (3 and 2) who are regulars at their daycare, and my kids love it. i am not in a contract, and so far have had no issues with payments or extra fees. gym is always super clean. in fact, every time i'm there somebody is always cleaning."
1-star,0,"ahh! gold's gym. this is the most ridiculous gym i've ever been to i wouldn't recommend it to my worst enemy! it's a nice sized gym & i love the set up but the staff & contracts are insane. i signed up for this gym in july & i loved it & it was month to month so i wasn't in a contract. then carey (mr. persistent) wouldn't leave me alone about a trainer! so he talked his way into lowering my first months bill to $28 & i would meet with theresa once a week, every week. he also said he would give me an additional 4 training sessions for free, i wouldn't have to pay until my sessions were used up. fast forward to the end of august & that's where i start having problems! i went in to change the card that i had on file for my contract & i asked carey how many sessions i had available. he told me i had 4 left but my payment was due in about 4 days of $128 (not sure if he knows what ""free"" means exactly). i simply said okay & went home to call the company that the contract is under. i informed them that i would be moving soon for school & wanted to know how to cancel my contract with my trainer when the time came. i'm thinking i would have to pay a hefty fee & that would be it! wrong! this guy told me i owe the gym not 128 but $160 & to cancel my contract i would have to provide proof that i'm actually moving (residency application & proof that my school tuition is paid). on top of proof i have to pay the $160 plus $250 to cancel plus an additional $128 for the last month which i can't use. but i loved loved loved my trainer theresa though! she's so passionate about what she does & she motivates you, the sweetest person i've ever met! but there was times where she would either forget we had a workout session & didn't show up or she would think my workout sessions were at times i never scheduled for! oh & i can't transfer my membership to washington state because this golds gym isn't universal."
1-star,0,"this used to be clean nice place but now it dirty, overcrowd and management will do a quick switch and bait on their membership deals. watch out for those hidden ""special assessments"" thats how they get you in the door and promise you its only 10 bucks a month then hit you with all these fees and changes. i felt better taken care at s used car salesmen convention."
1-star,0,terrible scam artists. totally misrepresented my contract. there is othes gyms in the area...do yourself a favor and go elsewhere.
3-star,0,"there's some ups and downs about this gym, but the main source of me joining, is to work out and make myself healthy, regardless where i work out. i joined back in december when we moved a bit further up north. i was a bit skeptical in a sense but i was at that point of accepting anything. gold gym on aliante seems to be a decent size gym. not to big and not to small like other gyms who probably have less equipment. comparing it to other gold gyms, yea it is small but it does give you what you need to work out. i'll admit, signing up seems like a hassle, but you do have that option to say no. but i decided to get the personal trainer and see how it goes. the good thing i like about it, is that it's 24 hours and can work out anytime during the day. especially for some one like me, who works graveyard. a few of them even greets me by my first name, before i get scanned in. then again, i go there 6 days a week. they tend to be friendly and some of them tend to be quiet. i do like the fact that some of the trainers there tend to give me tips on working out and see what can be more effective. i never did go into the cinema gym, to work out, just to take a look inside and it seems a bit small with loud sound system. but i heard it was decent. as for my personal trainer, i did come to them to help me with my weight problem, so i can't really complain on what they think is best. even though, i do agree, that they have this main objective to make you throw up. but i take that as me being unhealthy and my fault that i got myself where i am in the first place. on the other hand, i miss that athleticism that i use to have and the way they train me makes me feel alive again. i don't mind the work out they put me through, it's just a matter of me taking it and how much i can endure. yes, it's a lot of work, but it's just 30 minutes once a week. i do agree that they tend to hire a lot of personal trainer, but so far, i enjoy my trainer and the people that work there. the down side of it, is that it's small in a sense, that it tends to get crowded quickly. then you have people waiting for you to get off a machine so they can do their work out. kind of feels awkward in a sense, but it's something to consider when you're at the gym during peak hours. to a pont that your work out has to be cut short cause the part of your body you want to work out is being used by some one else or being waited on by some one else. overall, i would give this more of a 3.5 star rating. despite gold's gym being a big name and high expectation, i consider this a decent place to work out. if you look pass the size of the gym, and find a decent time to work out, it can be very effective. i can understand that personal trainers there can be quiet and on their own. but it's just a matter of coming up to them and talk to them. cause they don't know if you need help or want to be bothered, not unless you step up first. signing up may be a bit of a hassle, but if you really want it, then go for it. let them do their thing on trying to twist your arm, but overall, it's there job and doing what they need to do to keep their job. i'm sure if you ever got a job like that, you probably be doing the same thing, or be like those other trainers and be released. other than that, i find this to be a decent place to work out. it's up to you how you see it, but it's great depending on when you go during the day. usually, mornings and late evenings tend to be a good time. afternoon and early evening tends to be more of the peak period, but i guess it depends on your schedule. if you join, where you can go to multiple gold gyms, take advantage of that too."
1-star,0,"this gym is the devil!!! told me i was signing a 12 month contract and could cancel at anytime if i paid the cancellation fee. they did a bait and switch and had me sign a 24 month contract (never gave me a copy... had me sign electronically). also, contract won't allow me to cancel even with paying a fee. the personal trainers keep quitting, transferring or getting fired. went thru 10 trainers in less than a year. spoke to the gm, marcel... said it was just industry standards and there wasn't anything he could do about it. this place is ridiculous!!!! want to cancel but i'm stuck. run... don't sign a contract."
3-star,0,"love cardio theater & that it's not too crowded. i wish they wouldn't forget to restart the movie all the time. annoying! also, the front desk girl that chews gum with her mouth open-horrendous! disgusting. didn't your mama teach you any manners? i almost threw up my luna bar."
4-star,1,"smaller gold's gym then some of the other ones, that's why they call it an express gym though. staff is always friendly when i come in and it's nice a few know you by name anytime they see you. personal trainers are great and will push you harder then you've been pushed before. great thing about going to this express gold's is there is nearly never a wait for tanning and if you are there mid day then virtual no wait for any lifting machine and no wait for cardio machines. there are a few more things i wish they had on the workout floor but you can't have it all can you?"
1-star,0,"small gym. it's an ""express"" location. the will lie and tell you anything to get you to join especially if you want personal training. double check your contract because they will enroll your spouse without telling you. there is new staff everyweek because they are hired and fired weekly so if the person who signs u up gets fired they will not help you."
1-star,0,this place is horrible there customer service is awful ! they are very nice when you sign up after that they are the worse customer service ever! hahahha your closed now i wonder why****
1-star,0,"the monthly price is wonderful, that being said they spend the rest of your membership trying to squeeze every dollar they can out of you. i tried to change my payment date and was told that the only way to do so was to cancel my membership, pay the cancellation fee and come back on the day of the month that i want my payment to be, re sign up and pay another ""annual fee"" of $39 even though i just paid that when i signed up three months before. oh, and don't forget your towel. if you don't have one you have to buy one of theirs for a dollar, just another way that they grab at our wallets. i'm not even going to get into the pain that cancelling the membership is and the extra costs that they tack on. the cheap monthly cost isn't even worth it because the gym is always packed, even at 5am. i'm so happy that i'm finished with gold's."
4-star,1,"my wife and i have been members of this gym for over four months after moving from california and being gym members there. we love the cardio cinema and use it every day with only one recommendation, more elyticals. my wife and i like the front desk staff and especially a young redhead named tanya. she would be great as gold's gym public relations trainer or possibly gym manager. we have automatic payment of gym dues and have experienced no problems. quite a few gym members need to learn what the disinfectants and towels are used for."
2-star,0,"a well balanced gym. not leaning towards lifters or cardio. the clientele is cool. most everyone is serious about their workouts. not a lot of talking. the machines are always broken (cardio and weight training) however some seem to be getting replaced. there is a nasty water spill in the men's bathroom that has been there for a while. it's starting to smell really bad. over all, setup is nice. i frequent a 24 hr fitness on craig that i like a lot more. i use this golds for a change of scenery from time to time. why only 2stars?.... well... nothing pisses me off more than their shitty ""no towel, no entry"" policy. golds gym west covina has free towel service for all its members and charges the same membership fees. i've never heard of this kind of policy. there are broken machines, water fountains that smell like mold, missing clips on benches, and a water spill that i need to hop over in order to get to the sauna every day... but you're more concerned with posting large agressive signs and turning your customers away because they didn't bring a towel. yeah yeah... people should bring a towel to the gym, i get it. but sheesh.... turning people away? i've been to a lot of golds gyms. i respect the brand. i love the atmosphere and i know how awesome they can be. this one has fallen a little further from the tree."
1-star,0,place deserves no stars! it's dirty! no one wipes down there machines the lack of care for place shows on worn beat up equipment! i joined for the theater sole reason! they never change the movies! start them when it ends! follow the schedule of movie that should be now playing! they are e treacly rude the just walk in and turn on lights for whatever reason! they shut it down at 945 not 10pm! they charge the same price as lvac with zero services!
1-star,0,"if i could give them 0 stars i would! screw this gym, they only want your money. no wonder they have over 584 complaints on consumer affairs! extremely upset and appalled at their unprofessional customer service. they don't send out notices or let their clients know when their contract/year mark is coming up. i wasn't even aware until i checked my bank statement and received a charge for $59.95. i called the gym to find out what was going on. they said my year contract was up and i was being charged $39 for the annual fee. since when was my contract up? i then asked why no notice was sent notifying me that my contract was coming to an end. the girl on the phone paused for a moment, then said ""in the contract you signed, i'm sure you read the part about the annual fee"". .... how does that answer my question? why don't you send out notices to your clients keeping them informed of this?! i asked to get the charge reversed and my membership canceled. they said they couldn't do that and gave me the member services phone number. i called them, and they gave me the same bs scripted response. ""the contract you signed stated an annual fee"". sigh. i'm so irritated at the lack of comprehension these employees have. no one seems to comprehend that i am asking why no letter or notice was sent to the client. i understand the annual fee. had i known it was coming up, i would've canceled once my contract was up. needless to say, i'm out, just canceled! packed gym, not enough equipment, plus this experience makes being a member here not worth it. once the new lvac opens, i'm headed back there. gold's gym is a joke. they may have the $59.95, but they've lost a client and i'll make sure to direct anyone who asks to any gym but this one. tip: write the date of your annual fee on a calendar, or put it into your phone so you are aware of the renewal date since they don't notify you."
5-star,1,"so i just recently signed up to this gym about a week ago. the staff was very helpful. i'm not very good when it comes to working out because half of the time i have no clue what i was doing. gus informed me about the offers they have with gym trainers and they take care of you! stefon hooked me up with an awesome deal and now i'm excited as ever. if you guys are looking for a sincere staff that cares about fitness and your well being, awesome gym atmosphere, great classes and great equipments this place is it. they have tons of stuff, 2 stories and i only pay 20 bucks. i totally recommend this place!"
5-star,1,"just moved from chicago suburbs, i was looking for a complete fitness center which offers a variety of classes and personal training. living in n. vegas, it was hard to find something close enough, much less with those requirements, plus reasonable monthly rates. well, believe it or not, a different brand club manager referred me to check out gold's on losee. immediately upon meeting membership staff, blake s. and provided with the most pumped up tour i have ever had in my 40-something years in clubs, i was sold this would be my new home! not only does gold's work with your total fitness regime, however, they provide nutrition guidance. blake's through tour and patience in answering all my questions, were the highlight of my day! (my last membership was with la fitness, so i know the questions to ask). anyway, i can't wait to take my first class tomorrow, so i just may have to go tonite!"
1-star,0,"their location is kind of dirty, and there's never any room to do anything because they're overpopulated all the time. the girls at the front desk are usually pretty rude, and if they're not rude they're standing around not doing anything. the staff members over badger you to sign up for different promotions. i get texts almost weekly from them even when i've told them i wasn't interested. they lied to me about my payment plan, and now i'm under fees that i didn't originally agree to. when i confronted the guy i signed up with about it of course he had no clue what i was talking about. the member services people can't do anything to fix it. i am almost hesitant to even try to fix the issue because i know for a fact that they're going to lie their way out of it. i'm not the only person who's had problems with them about hidden fees or false information. i probably came into the gym twice and i'm turned off about how it's not ever kept up, and the customer service sucks. when i texted the kid i signed up with to get the cancelation number he said it was on the back of my membership card, which i never received. so then he tried to talk me out of canceling then almost seemed judgmental about me canceling in the first place. it took forever to get to the point and for him to hand over the phone number. i am not impressed what so ever with this gym. i would not come back to this gym again nor would i suggest them to any of my family or friends. honestly if you want to be tricked into high rates i would suggest going to golds gym on losee. they're good for it."
1-star,0,"gold's gym is garbage now. they lowered their prices to $10 a month and now they are always packed. the equipment is never clean and the staff are tools. now they are trying to nickel and dime people by making towels mandatory and charging for their towels. how about you clean your own machines?! i didn't sign up to be your janitor. at the very least, keep your bleach bottles full! lvac is a way better gym. i can't wait for the new one to open on 215 and n. decatur."
5-star,1,i walked in with a goal and golds gym is going to help me every step of the way. the whole facility was clean and organize. the staff was very friendly and nice. a special thanks to stephon for helping me with the gym tour and answering all my questions. the kids area was clean and very neat. i'm ready for this big journey with gold's gym. thank you!!!
1-star,0,horrible misrepresentation of fees. i asked on the phone what all the fees would be and was only told $10 to join and $25 for the month. i would never pay more than $25 a month. i go down to the gym and then get told there is an annual fee of $40. they are hiding the enrollment fee as an annual fee.
4-star,1,"this isn't going to be a long review...just wanted to say the service at this golds gym is awesome! i went with a friend as a guest and signed up on my next visit! also, the pool is open 24/7, so i can get my cardio in without running :)"
5-star,1,"never been to a golds gym before, always been 24 hour fitness. but since this one is right around the corner and there are no 24 hours in my area, i decided to check it out. once i walked in i realized there was no difference from what i'm used too. really big gym, has basketball courts, pool, the works! i sat down with a manager to discuss rates and for $10 down i'm in for $20 a month! and i can bring a friend every single day for free. this is huge for me and my girlfriend. looking forward to coming to this gym a lot! -joe"
2-star,0,even in late night the place is full. there is too many people endless place to work out. they have to make this place bigger.
4-star,1,"clean, fresh gym. i will drive the extra two miles to this gym versus the one i signed up at because it's just so refreshing. it has a great variety of classes to choose from, wow so many that sometimes i debate which i want to take. the staff is very friendly and the weight and cable machines are well taken care of, they seem new. when it comes to yoga kieta is my favorite instructor, she just flows."
1-star,0,"they charged me over $150 for 3 months of membership, application fees, and cencellation fees when i never recived a fricken membership card. so basically i was never a member and never used the gym! this review is also going to the bbb, facebook, twitter, instagram, gold's gym corporate ceo and referencing the fair credit billing act per the federal trade commision for undelived service or goods. if you want to be cheated and scammed out of your money for trying to be a member, apply for membership."
1-star,0,"this gym is terrible. i have a membership here and at lvac and i am just waiting until the new lvac opens on decatur and the 2-15 to cancel my membership at gold's because this place is a joke. there are only 5 stair master machines and at least one is always broken. the others are hardly functional and can't seem to keep a steady pace. honestly, i think that might be a safety hazard in itself. i've mentioned it to the desk and they're still not working properly. on top of that, it seems like a new machine is out of commission downstairs every day as well. i can never seem to get in a complete workout because something i want to use always happens to be broken. also, the selection of machines as well as the quality of the machines here is deplorable. this membership costs me more monthly than lvac ever has and i am 100% unsatisfied. counting the minutes until the new lvac opens."
5-star,1,"i must say i was impressed with this location. not only was the gym really nice, the customer service given was very welcoming. i signed up with korbin and he presented everything very professionally. i work in the medical field and i really take pride in the way i provide customer service to my patients. i feel today people lack knowledge in the meaning of customer service and how important it is because that is really what brings people back. i signed up for a personal trainer as well so i will have to say that caesar was great in helping me with that. i was also able to meet my trainer josh, which i must say i am looking forward to training with him. he seemed very energetic and he had a great aura about him. crossing my fingers that the first impression the staff provided me, is one that will continue on. :)"
2-star,0,"i originally transferred from 24 hour fitness off of ann rd, because i moved to the north side. i actually wish i never did. my top 3 complainants about this gym: 1. teenagers are everywhere!!! don't plan to get a good workout during the summer time when they are out of school. all they do is work out in groups of like 5 and sit on the equipment all day. 2. equipment is terrible and old. most of the free motion machine equipment is either missing the proper attachment handles or rigged together in an unsafe manner. this is actually embarrassing, especially when the gym charges you a yearly monthly maintenance fee...what a joke. 3. the dirtiest locker room i've every experienced. if you like to change in a dirt locker room with trash all over the place, then this is the spot for you. bottom line, if you can treat yourself, spend the extra money and go to 24 hour fitness off of ann. military, i would just go the warrior fitness center on base...for real!"
1-star,0,"victor the manager at the gold's gym in las vegas is arbitrarily charging for fees that aren't listed. victor the manager at the gold's gym in las vegas is arbitrarily charging for fees that aren't listed. when victor spoke to me he had a mouthful of food. i waited nearly 10 minutes to speak to someone. victor told me that i needed to pay an extra $10.00 a month to use the tanning beds. i've been going to gold's gym for months, yet no one told me about this. in fact, when i signed up, the salesperson told me i wouldn't have to pay an additional money to use the facilities other than the day care and spin classes. that was a lie to get my membership."
1-star,0,was strongly thinking about getting a membership here being that it is very close to my house. i have been a golds member in the past. was really not all that impressed with the facility. the customer service was terrible i honestly felt like i was buying a used car! i think im gonna save the money and work out for free at nellis afb and just make the drive over there instead.
1-star,0,"very disappointed in this place. has gotten ghetto and dirty. there was an altercation with 2 guys where it broke out into a big agreement and the staff did nothing. i talked to one of the guys and he said they didnt do anything because it wasn't their problem it's your gym! avoid coming here. too many little kids ""working out."" weights left all over. ghetto ppl but it's now only 10 bucks to sign up so i shouldn't be surprised."
4-star,1,"i've been working out here since the summer and i must say i'm a huge fan of the cardio cinema! no matter what time of day i go, i can find a machine, watch a movie, and get my cardio on. this place is so clean, too. the locker room is always being mopped and wiped and i've also seen the cleaning gal dusting the workout areas and machines. the child care workers really seem to enjoy what they're doing, and greet my child by name. i've never taken any classes because i'm too embarrassed to trip over my own feet, but i might give zumba a try. i've even thought of just sitting in the hot tub with a book!"
1-star,0,"i should have headed the warnings about golds billing practices. golds policy is to charge a ""rate lock fee"" after you have been a member for 120 days. i canceled my membership per their 31 day notice policy, at less than 120 of total membership. they still billed my account the $39 rate lock fee. i disputed the charge and they told me i have to cancel within 60 days in order for my membership to expire before 120 days. that is not what the contract that i signed states. it clearly states must provide 31 day notice within 120 days to avoid rate lock fee. this is why golds is losing business and has gone from ""the"" gym to empty parking lots. i highly recommend not joining."
4-star,1,"love it way more than 24! personally, i have never had a rude experience with any staff in the 2 mths. i've been there, but i go to workout not make bff's!"
5-star,1,"the losee location of golds gym is amazing. everything from swimming pool to a basketball court. fitness classes such as zumba and mma are available to your disposal. the staff is very friendly and energetic and the personal trainers are fun to work with to help you reach your ideal body state. if you call shannon harris at the aliante & centennial location (10 minutes from centennial and losee) at 702-396-0800, he'll hook you up with a golds gym membership for $0 down, 1st month free, $20 per/mo. after. call now to make your appointment"
3-star,0,i really like the equipment and facility but it is very expensive. the staff is always friendly and helpful. i really wish it was more affordable.
4-star,1,"i really like this gym. it's super clean and the staff is friendly. they have everything you'd need.. great locker room, pool, kid's care, a cinema and tons of classes. i do agree with someone who mentioned rates fluctuating. i spoke to three different people and got three different quotes. try talking to dc.. he's pretty helpful and will work with you. highly recommend this place. probably the best gym i've ever been to."
4-star,1,love it! the classes are so much fun and you dont even feel like you are workig out!! great atmosphere! really busy from 4 to 8... that's why i go at 530 am! lol
1-star,0,"the facility was average but the issue that i had was that they didn't cancel my membership when i called and asked them to. the woman who i spoke to said that i was all set but that was certainly not the case. i used a credit card that i don't use often so i didn't see the reoccurring charges, but eventually rather than calling me about it they sent debt collectors. it was a complete disaster and the only way for me to fight it was to get a lawyer. in the end it was just cheaper to pay them. they are a crooked company so beware!"
2-star,0,"quite possibly the worst gold's gym ever. most of the equipment is ancient by big box gym standards--maybe stuff from the 80s? the squat racks and weight benches in particular are something you might expect to see in a gym at a poorly-funded junior high school. and some of the equipment is in such disrepair that it may be dangerous to use. the layout of the place is terrible, too. there's a giant, unused space between the front desk and the equipment room that could be used for more equipment but instead seems to serve no purpose whatsoever. i've been to other gold's gym locations in other states, and the sorry state of equipment at this one in almost unbelievable. the staff is friendly--or at least professional--but otherwise this place is a huge disappointment."
4-star,1,represents the gold's chain well! filled with weights galore and good equipment all around. is a play ground for the serious body builder.
1-star,0,"so, i've worked out here on and off for years but my health was waning so after about a year of paying and not going, i canceled my membership. come to find out i needed open-heart surgery. so after a month in the hospital and several months of rehab, i'm feeling great again and i want to get back in real shape. so, i'm thinking i'll go back to gold's. the day before i return there i get a call from a collection agency and you see where this is going? did the one star give me away? they dropped a bomb on me to the tune of $299!! i told them they were clearly mistaken, after all, i don't have a membership with golds. so i call them and lo and behold, my membership wasn't canceled after all. i explained that during my surgery, and subsequent convalescence, i was living on food stamps and obama care. oh and i paid you clowns for a year without setting foot in here. if anything, i'm due a refund. they wouldn't hear any of it. and to top it off, i can't cancel until i pay my back dues and then i'm required to give a month's notice, just so they can stick it to me for one more month? i'm currently working on getting this resolved but it's not looking too promising. decades of loyalty don't mean squat, apparently. all that aside, i've always been satisfied with gold's, though it's the only place i know where you put your life in your hands if you cross between a bodybuilder and his mirror in mid-rep. thank god i have the ability to sweet talk my way out of a fight. and yes, there are monsters there. massively insecure steroidal lunks and scary arnie-esque ""women"" who spend at least 4 hrs a day, 364 (they're closed xmas) days a year in there, but who cares? the question you need to ask is, do you give a sh*t? if you do, go elsewhere and if you do join gold's, god forbid you fall behind. let's face it, the people who have money are over at lifetime."
1-star,0,"rude! pushy! crowded! i went in with a 7 day trial pass and specifically said i wanted to try out the gym. the sales guy was pushy from the beginning, trying to get me to sign up for a membership without even offering me a tour of the gym. i again told him that i would not commit to a gym i hadn't tried out or seen for that matter. he then said ""a gym's a gym"". great selling point. he then seemed annoyed but gave me a tour when i insisted. i asked what a few of the classes were, he couldn't even tell me. i asked if they have personal training, his reply was ""we're a gym. don't all gyms have personal training? well, maybe _____ doesn't, but they aren't trying to help anyone."" (insulting another gym). after the ""tour"", he then again tried to push me into a membership. i again was firm and said i wanted to try the gym, so he copped an attitude, gave me my pass, and told me to contact him if i want to sign up. i asked if i could sign up online (why give him commission when he attitude was horrible) and he smarts off ""whatever makes you happy"" then walked away. i then went in the very crowded gym, the eliptical program shut off midway through so i had to start over. i got so irritated i left before my workout was complete."
4-star,1,super cheap monthly deal-$15 a month and that includes unlimited classes. what else could you want? it is not fancy so if you want a luxury gym this isn't it. but if you're looking for cheap + gym + 24 hours + classes = this is the spot
1-star,0,let me tell you how the suck you in. it's cheaper and that is what you get cheaper. equipment is old dirty. if you try to cancel it is a big run around. they charge a cancelation fee and you can only do it on line. go somewhere else it is not worth a cheaper price.
1-star,0,"this place went from alright to horrible as soon as they lowered their membership fee to $9.99 a month. the gym is now consistently filthy, the machines are always broken, paper towels are never stocked, none of the bar clips in the whole place work, and worse of all, the low membership fees have attracted what seems like every gang member, thug, and eminem wannabe in the area to join. do yourself a favor and don't waste your time here."
4-star,1,"eh, i'm really on the fence about this place. it is what it is- this is where the bodybuilders come. these people are *serious* about their fitness, and it shows. you come here a few nights a week, and you'll see the same people here night after night after night. it can be a little intimidating, and honestly if it wasn't for the fact that my personal trainer works here i would have stayed at my other gym. but it's fine- the biggest complaint that i have is the fact that it's always packed. you're going to have to park a ways away at most hours, and there's always a horde of people working out here. in all honesty though, i've only rarely ever had to wait for any machines. and anytime i did have to, i was able to just jump in between sets with whoever was on it. this is a big gym, and it seems like they have good facilities and whatnot. i haven't really checked too much into what all they offer, but at some point i'll probably try some of the yoga classes or something. i was a little intimidated the first few times i came here, but now i know my way around well enough to just come in, put in the work, and go home. everyone i've ever dealt with here has been friendly and professional, so no complaints on that front. they could do a better job of picking up all of the paper towels that people throw on the ground after wiping the machines... but hey, at least people are cleaning the machines (even if they can't clean up after themselves... hashtag paradox)."
1-star,0,"i am giving this gym 1 star because of the general manager charles kern!! rude doesn't begin to describe the attitude he had with me over disputing a fee on my account that wasn't supposed to be there. threatened to forcefully remove me from the gym. threatened to call the cops! constantly cut me off while talking, and said little demeaning remark and comments. this guy is a coward beyond words! worst management ever if this is the face of your establishment!!! i was a member of this gym for 2yrs, and just because i am not a member anymore he didn't even want to talk to me.. the gym itself is nice, basic golds gym. go in lift weights and get out. but if you are even remotely considering going to this gym. dont!!!!!"
1-star,0,i canceled my membership months in advance due to the fact the gym was in constant disrepair. come to find out they never canceled the membership. the representative i called was not helpful and i had to leave a message with a supervisor. he also didn't put me on hold and i could be hear him speaking about how he wanted to get laid that night. listen dude i am all for people getting laid but cancel my membership when i ask please! i really wish i didn't have to give them one star. stay away!
1-star,0,"while i enjoyed actually working out at this gym, if you value your sanity and credit rating, never, ever, join gold's gym! i cancelled my membership months ago and paid in full, but their collection agency will not stop harassing me! gold's and swift collections work together to rip you off and ruin your credit. they have an f rating from the better business bureau. wish i had checked before i joined."
2-star,0,"i am in full agreement with others about the equipment condition. though i get a good workout because of the variety, there are many repair issues as evident in all the ""broken signs"" that seem to stay on the machines forever. even machines that work could use maintenance. i had been a member 10 years ago and will say that when i came back 5 months ago because of my daughters request, it was a deja vu.....nothing has changed. as for cleanliness, the place could use a really good cleaning especially the bathrooms. there are many customers at this location so i cannot imagine the repair/cleanliness issue is to blame on financial reasons. this is obviously a poorly managed location and i have written to corporate 2 months ago with no reply."
3-star,0,"good gym - has everything i need, though it is packed at night during the week. don't be fooled by their ""4 free personal trainer sessions"" when you sign up though. those sessions are nothing more than a way for them to give you a sales pitch to sign a personal trainer contract. i had one session that lasted about ten minutes and when i called to conform my 2nd session, the trainer flaked and cancelled on me and never called to reschedule. i'm fairly sure he was getting the feeling i wasn't going to be signing a personal trainer contract so he bailed thinking he was wasting his time. not cool. again, great gym but don't expect to use any ""free"" personal trainer sessions unless you want to fight to get them, which i didn't care to."
1-star,0,"golds gym sucks!! manager told me he was going to cancel membership, failed to do so. he doesn't even have the balls to call me. what a pussie!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5-star,1,"what first drew me into this gym was the price thinking ""it's either too good to be true or the gym's quality is the reason why it's cheap"". i went to check the place out and i got to take a look around. it literally took me 5 minutes to decide i wanted to join this gym and 4 months later, i still have no regrets. i'm not picky so the very few worn down equipment didn't lose me as long as its still does its job efficiently. what i love about this gym is the atmosphere. mostly everyone in this gym is extremely friendly especially the employees. it's truly a humbling place to workout at because everyone there is very considerate of people working out around them. there's rarely anyone who thinks they're so much better than the other. and i believe that this type of atmosphere came from the great employees that work there. not every gym out there has all their equipment perfectly running 24/7. of course stuff happens and equipment breaks down from time to time. but golds has an abundant amount of other equipment to adjust to for your workouts and they constantly try to find ways to make our visits convenient. what does bring me down a bit is when female custodians clean the men's locker room, making me wait forever to get in. but at least they're really nice about it haha"
1-star,0,"go to gym to train and apparently i need the gms permission to use the fitness room when there isn't a class in progress. how the heck can you say that i need permission to use a part of a gym that i'm paying membership for? you have all my personal information on file, you know more about me than i know about you. so this can't be a trust/ security issue. what a waste of time."
4-star,1,"this golds is much bigger than the one in tukee, and nicer too. the employees up front are always nice, there is plenty of equipment to use. they even have a special workout area for women here so girls don't have to feel creeped out by dudes checking them out, which i know is a big complaint for most women at gyms. i want to give it 5 stars, but the gym is really busy at the start of the week, and most weekdays it can be a little difficult to find a parking space, but that's not exactly something golds could improve upon but worth mentioning. for $15/mo you can't lose."
5-star,1,"i lift things up, i put them down. i lift things up, i put them down. staff is friendly. the only thing that annoys me are the *cough*women*cough* who are there when i go. sitting on machines for 10 minutes and only doing one set of 5 reps. the women who sweat all over equipment and never wipe them down after using them. and the dumb chick with her purse by her, texting on her cell phone while wearing flip flops. because like omg, she couldn't like tear herself away from her facebook or twitter or instagram or texting her beiber boyfriend. pick up your paper towels too!!!!!!"
5-star,1,"this gym is pretty old but everything is well maintained. this place is great for bodybuilders, it's big, has old school equipment, metal weights. there is a unbelievable amount of different equipment. over all great gym, check it out if your looking for a place that will help you get results. you can't beat the price either. 10 bucks a month to use over a hundred machines and free weights. they have a kids area. and the gym is never crowded, although i'm never there at 5pm."
1-star,0,"i'm not a member of a gym but i wanted to take a look around and see what this one had to offer. when i asked the girl behind the counter if i could look at what they have she would not let me go in without filling out a bunch of bs paperwork. i'm sure it was so that some guy could walk me around, waste my very precious time talking about things i already know, and try to persuade me to join their gym. that's not what i wanted. i already had my decision made that if i saw the equipment i wanted to use that i would go ahead & join. i just wanted to run in & out quickly while i had a free minute to do so and check it out. oh well, i figure i just saved myself some time and money with this place. i used to be with la fitness. they are wonderful! i think i may check out the gilbert rec center & see what they have. i'm sure they won't mind me taking a look. if not, i'll head back to la which i highly recommend."
1-star,0,"i went in to this location sign up with my girlfriend. first thing i noticed while walking through the door was the horrible smell. this made me then look around briefly and i saw how filthy the entrance floor was. i can only imagine the inside of the gym. i did not make it that far. after talking for maybe 2 minutes to the steroid driven 'manager?', i realized just how friendly the staff was going to be. i asked a few questions about pricing so clearly they thought i was some kind of 'corporate shopper' and answered every question with a joker like laugh, not a smile. 24 hr fitness is our new gym and we couldn't be happier. clean, updated and a truly friendly staff from the entrance to the cleaning locker."
1-star,0,"my wife and i have been members of the gold's gym in gilbert, az gym number: 0175 for going on a year. i have to say that the gym has degraded quite a bit since we have joined. the gym seems to have over enrolled to the point that there are not enough parking spaces during peak hours causing people to ""create"" parking spots. the cardio equipment is dilapidated at best, when we first joined there were six elliptical trainers since then two were removed due to malfunction and the four that are left are barely running and a couple are not level. i am currently in contact with gold's corporate to see if there is any way that i can cancel the rest of my contract so that i can join a gym with adequate and functional equipment."
1-star,0,"this gym is doing false advertising by saying they have a swimming pool. i called and apparently they are an ""express"" location, whatever that means. they are not a full gym and they are misrepresenting on yelp. will definitely report them."
2-star,0,"i wish the change in the temperatures was actually true. today, it's 76. in october. the cardio area is even hotter, as it's located behind large glass windows without adequate film to block the sunlight. is 76 degrees really an improvement???"
4-star,1,great gym. small and intimate enough so that you aren't getting intimidated. it's very clean and the staff is very friendly. i stopped going to fitness connection over this gym.
1-star,0,"this location needs to be more clear on their website about club hours. this facility is open at 9:00 am for out of town guests. my membership dues cover all gyms, however, i was unable to work out at my usual time of 6:30 am, because this facility operates more like a fitness center than a gym. planet fitness is more a of a gym than this particular facility."
2-star,0,"when i first started going to this gym i thought it had the potential to be 5-stars but as i have continued my membership my expectation decreased. i think my initial dissatisfaction really started from day one, but i had a hope that things would get better. despite its lack of a stretch area, and classes, we signed up for this small gym 20 mins from our house. we should've have listened to our gut because this gym still has not lived up to the potential it could have. on the initial day we signed up we voiced our concerns to the desk clerk. she ensured that any problems we had would be resolved with the arrival of their new location. she confirmed that the bigger location would have a better stretch area, more classes, and an overall larger facility. for the price you pay for this small location, we could easily be at a gym with more amenities. but, the idea we could transition into a new and bigger gym, made us okay settling for a few months. as time has gone on, we have realized we were set up. it has been almost a year since we first signed up, and the larger facility is no where near completion. i drove past the supposed ""new facility"" earlier this afternoon, and the building is still in shambles. the old sign is up, and there is still full construction needed inside. the desk clerk lied to us from day one. because i am still within my ""one year"" contract, i will reluctantly continue to use this small facility. i will continue to pay a high membership fees, for amenities similar to a bargain gym. but, once my membership is over i'm out. there is no point paying such high fees for a gym full of sleazy salesmen (women). buyer beware: there are several other gyms in the area with better amenities, better machines, more variety of classes, better service, and better prices. there really isn't any point of joining this gym, as it does nothing to outshine the other gyms in the area."
1-star,0,"awful experience. i tried to cancel membership back in november 2015 by going to the golds gym 28269 location on 4 different occasions between the times of 3-5pm. every time no one was working the front desk. i called and obviously cancelled payment from my cc because its not my job to hunt one of their staff members down to cancel. i received a call 2 weeks ago asking for a new payment method since i owed $86. i called the lady back in there accounting and told her the story that i hadn't been to the gym in over 3 months and wouldn't be paying 86 dollars when i tried 4 separate times to come in and cancel. just now i received a call from susan apparently the extremely rude gm of all charlotte location? she told me she ""pulled"" records for all her staff for the past 4 months and all her staff was on duty apparently every time i came in and saw no one? i told her i did my part and tried to cancel the way they asked, by going in and signing and paying a balance from back in nov.. she then told me shes got to figure out how shes going to ""make me"" pay this $86.. wow. i asked her why is she being so rude to a customer? she said i am trying to figure out whats going on? i said its very clear susan...i tried to come in and cancel my membership and you didn't have your facility appropriately staffed because no one was working the 4 times i came in. she then tried to keep arguing with me and told me i must have come in all 4 times on a friday when her staff leaves at 2pm. instead of going on arguing with the ""golds gyms gm"" - i just asked her for kevins number assuming he would be professional in that he owns the gym. she told me you cant have his number but i'll give you his email and hes going to tell you the exact same thing - well i've emailed him twice about this already and no response back from him? is this really how people operate businesses? and really a gm trying to contentiously argue with a customer? note to kevin - susan needs some customer service skills."
1-star,0,"buyer beware: i contacted this gym last spring inquiring about a temporary membership and was induced to sign up for a year because if i moved (as i fully expected to, told the staff member, and eventually did--out of state), i would be able to get out of the contract. i relied on the word of a staff member who, of course, is no longer with the company. the staff is misinformed (even the current staff, who advised me two days ago that a usps change of address confirmation would suffice--only to be told by management when i provided such confirmation that that person was ""new"" and ""misunderstood the cancellation policy,"") and even though the owner concedes this fact, he accepts no responsibility for it. [in case you are wondering, the contract, which has quite a different cancellation policy than what was sold to me by the staff member, is presented to you via touchscreen--extraordinarily difficult if not impossible to read--and the hard copy is only given to you after you sign and after you pay.] there are constant emails from staff advising of corrections to the now-reduced spinning schedule, problems with equipment not working properly, etc. the equipment is dirty even though during my visits there i saw very few people. this place is not even remotely worth the hassle, and frankly the fact that management induces students--people with little to no income like myself--to sign contracts that they cannot get out of makes me sick. please spend your money with people who actually care about doing the right thing. 11/13/15 update: here is my response to owner kevin's comment below: ""kevin, to confirm, i have already reached out. here was part of your response: 'i left you a detailed vm regarding the situation. listen michelle i know what you say you heard and what you were told but i don't believe my staff would tell you that a cell phone bill would work, especially when it lists out all of the accepted items on the contract. michelle if you tell ten people the same something and then ask them to recall it 6 months later, you will get 10 different answers, hence why we have paper contracts that don't require interpretation or memory. it is in large bold print that is underlined. i am sorry but you are going to be held to what you agreed to do per the contract.' "" interestingly, i later called the gym, was told by a staff member that an address change confirmation would work, obtained such documentation & sent it to you, and received a call from susan simko advising that the staff member was ""new"" and ""made a mistake."" so, you see, it is possible that your staff misinform people. and it is nothing short of wrong that you hold students with little to no income to contracts based on misrepresentations made by your staff. also kevin, i will be filing a complaint with the ag's office regarding gold's (arbor creek) unethical practices. it's possible nothing will come of it, but hopefully by posting this, more people will be brave enough to complain. people like me have few resources to fight back (this is why you solicit students, right?), but i will use all available resources to protect my money. which really isn't even mine--it comes from the government. so congratulations."
1-star,0,"dirty. arrogant, nasty owner. disengaged staff. employees actually sit in the office and eat cheeseburgers. stay away."
5-star,1,"this was the first gym that i joined when i moved to vegas 4 years ago. at first i was apprehensive about going and a little embarrassed because of my weight. the day i walked in i was greeted with a big smile from travis, fitness coordinator. he made me feel welcomed and asked me to pick a trainer on the wall. i picked adrian and she worked me out, i almost passed out the first day because i was way out of shape. i went back to the gym everyday and had training twice a week for 6 weeks. i started seeing results and it felt great. i'd like to say hi to the great staff. thanks again to travis, adrian, maria, chris and fred!!!"
4-star,1,"i have never used a personal trainer here, so keep that in mind. this place is pretty much like most other gyms...it's a gym. has plenty of equipment, most of which is in great shape. like most gyms out there, no day is leg day, so the upper body equipment is hard to come by at peak hours. however, this is great when it is indeed leg day. i appreciate the fact that they have three squat racks (my old gym only had one), unless someone is doing curls on it...smh. this place can be a zoo during peak hours, but that is understood. theyre in the business of making money, hence the more memberships the better. good highway location and nice staff."
2-star,0,"pros: -clean facility, been here a while and it's always clean -staff is nice. understanding and easy going. helpful when needed. -affordable. any golds gym in the world for only $15 a month and no contract. annual fee of $40. it's quite affordable from what i've seen around the country. though admittedly some of the more expensive gyms around here are legitimately better. if you only care about price this is a good place to go. cons: -every day is chest day here. it is ridiculously hard to get a good clean chest day here. you will always be waiting on someone. - gym etiquette is not enforced here. weights are constantly in the wrong spot. weight trees will have several different weights on one limb so you have to dig through 45 and 25 lb plates if you want a 10 or a 5 (obviously that's not always the exact scenario, the point is you often have to remove one weight to get to another because people just put them wherever, instead of together with like weights.) always always always have to remove other people's weights when you get to a machine. it is a combination of the guests being very inconsiderate and lazy and also the staff being a little lazy. i know it's intimidating for a staff member to approach a guest and ask them to put their weights back when finished but that's what balls are for and it's apparent none of the staff has any. if the gym etiquette was fixed here i would call the gym a 4 star gym for cleanliness and kindness of staff but gym etiquette is a huge part of the gym experience and it's severely lacking here. this is old school super basic gym etiquette and it's not being taught or enforced at all. without some kind of order and regulation people will just do whatever they want and usually the path of least resistance is lazy and inconsiderate of others. there's more to managing a gym than solely focusing on sales and wiping down the equipment. just being honest."
4-star,1,"i was never much of gym person that i thought i would take out a membership, but i'm really liking this place. although i have been working out at this golds for almost a couple weeks. the equipment is good, there are a lot of programs, the staff has been exceptional and the facility is clean. i seem to always get time on device even at peak hours if any very little wait. i gave jason my business he's been really straight up and always available if i had questions. thanks golds!"
5-star,1,"ok. ok. this review is months overdue. i moved to the area in january and was looking for a gym. i had been a member of golds gym in the past and this was my first option. i didn't have to shop around, the price was better than i had previously. ofcourse any gym wouldn't be a gym, if they didn't offer the other programs available. i thought here i go, but after talking to benjamin my attitude changed. i told him my goals and the trouble i had in the past and my concerns of putting back on the 40+ pounds that i had recently lost. hence the reason for joining a gym rather than using the free gum at my apartment complex. i was loosing my motivation and needed help. he suggested that i would benefit from a personal trainer. i signed on for one day a week for a year. my first trainer, kalinda was great,but she moved and i inherited nick. nick is awesome. he gives a lot of useful information. he stress the importance of diet and correct form. i am totally worn out after each workout, but i feel great. i know that i would have seen more results if i follow his eating recommendations, but old habits are hard to break. i'm a work on progress. all of the trainers are helpful. they definitely lend a helping hand if they see someone doing an exercise incorrectly. nor are they are pushing. each time that i've went the facility is cleaned or was being cleaned. granted there are times where it's busy and getting on machines not knowing if they had been wiped down. no problem, there are paper towels and spray conviently located throughout the gym. once my water bottle fell, the top came off, and water went everywhere, even on another patron (sorry). the cleaning lady stopped what she was doing and cleaned up my mess. i have been in many times where the cleaning crew was busy wiping down machines, mopping, dusting, cleaning bathrooms, and so on. since being a member of golds i have not had any problems. lots of classes to choose from. the staff is professional and you get a warm greeting each time you come in. the ladies at the front desk aknowledge you coming in and going out. i have been to the other gold gyms around town and this one is my favorite."
1-star,0,watch out for the $54.99 yearly membership gold's gym charges it's in the contract and the salespeople don't mention it - then tag on the membership and you're at about $20 per month- they don't have a pool or spa and maintenance is inconsistent kinda dirty; sticking with lvac after two years you can pay yearly which averages out to $12 per month and it's much cleaner. glad i'm canceling.
1-star,0,total scam! watch out. tried to charge me ridiculously after my year contract was up. i canceled and yet they continued to charge me. i had to cancel for a second time after giving them more money for their mistake. watch out! it was perfect while i was there and turned way down. i wish it was the gym i had originally joined. now this is just another greedy gym with no ethics.
2-star,0,"i have been a member at this gym since it has been open. in the beginning it was a great gym to go to. since then, new management has come into place, the gym has become over crowded and the bathrooms are not kept clean. they have also started charging maintenance fees, however the machines are always broken. the lack of customer service at the front desk on saturday mornings during prime time is a dissatisfaction. if you sign up for the $10/month you get what you pay for, but as a long time member, the gym has gone downhill."
1-star,0,"this location just continues to go downhill. i have been a member since it opened. originally it was great. i was paying $25 and the classes were always busy, but not packed. ever since they started this $9.99 a month the place has completely changed. the classes are overcrowded during peak hours. you can barely move in classes like zumba and kickboxing, and the spin classes are always full (so you have to get there 15 minutes before to wait in line). since some people only pay $9.99 a month and don't have access to classes, they want to stamp your hand to take a class. the stamp doesn't wash off right away and i don't need to look like a was at a club the night before when i show up for work. luckily, they only ask for a stamp 5% of the time so you can just ignore them. the crowd at this gym has totally changed since the $9.99 special. obviously this has brought the gym more money, but the people who are paying $20-25 a month are going to start leaving. this is something me and my husband are seriously considering at this point."
2-star,0,"was a gr8 gym when i joined 8/13. new ownership has raped it. over crowded with ""trainers"", equipment in disrepair and no staff on the floor enforcing posted policies. if $10/month is what you can afford it's worth it otherwise pay a little more and you won't have to wait on arrogant trainers (not all but a majority) who think they own the place since there are no employees on the floor to advise them otherwise. most importantly if you upgrade your membership read the contract. they'll lie to your face and the next thing you know you're locked in for 1 year. it's very apparent that ownership will not reinvest $$ into the gym. been there since aug 2013 and there is not 1 single piece of new equipment, fixtures or stitch of an upgrade anywhere to be found. people abuse equipment because there are no staff personnel on the floor other than cleaning. which i do give them credit, the place is clean...if you discount the broken and stench ridden urinal in the men's locker room that took +2 weeks to repair. witnessed a staff member pouring muratic acid in it on several occasions."
3-star,0,visited this gym bc admission was free with my hotel stay at the townplace marriott suites. i got there in the afternoon during the week and it was busy. started off by warming up on an older treadmill and then made my way to weight training machines. there's a decent amount of equipment but i found the layout quite strange with equipment in smaller rooms and many machines lacked grips and were totally unusable. another quirk was i didn't see any hand sanitizer dispenser which my gym in so cal offers. the place seems worn out and a bit dirty and could use some tlc!
1-star,0,"sign up in january and i was loving the staff and vibe so i signed up with a trainer. my trainer left 4 weeks after i started with him. it took 4 weeks to get me a new trainer after 3 calls 1 email and empty promises. so i gave the new trainer a shot, hurt myself the first time out, had a second session and it was ok, clearly he was not engaged, nice guy though. i got the flu then my work hours changed. working 6 days a week 10-12 hours a day doesn't leave time for a work out. so i tried to cancel.... no, i have 8 months left in my contact. i'm like really i've gotten only 6 work out in since january and you've gotten free money from me and because of my work they won't let me out. ti said then get me a trainer who can work out when i'm available cause i'm in management and my hours fluctuate, haven't heard from them.... dont sign up for there training its a complete rip off.......im disgusted and discouraged.... i'm in healthcare and to be honest they don't care about your well being just making sales quotas."
2-star,0,"i would like to say the receptionist megan was nice- second the set up was all right, thsy definitely need to update their free weight it reminds me of old school. the trainers seem to be out of shape to be personal trainers. the bathrooms soom to be not clean garbage overflowing, lot of old creepy dudes staring with mustaches and only have one weight scale. no towels provided didnt see sanitizer spray for the machines."
5-star,1,"it's that time of the year when the gym is packed of course with the ""new year resolutioners"" but i can't complain. heck, i was one of them last year! so fast forward 12 months, i've come to appreciate this gym! i stuck to my fitness plan and reached my fitness goal for the year!. this location is my favorite. it's clean, doesn't stink like sweaty bodies, there's plenty of parking space. the staff here is friendlier. ive met cool people and gained new friends, and i'm a fan of the group fitness classes they offer here. the membership i signed up for included unlimited group fitness classes at gold's gym. this location here at stephanie offers the most group classes. it's a no brainer taking advantage of what they have for the membership price i got. they have classes for every level, low or high impact, some even designed for seniors! my favorites are the dance fitness classes. love hot hula fitness! it's like a bit of polynesian dancing, alot of cardio! it's a great core workout! it's not high impact, it's not hot, temperature wise, but you'll sweat! the class isnt too crowded, so there's more room to move. the instructor provides the ""lava lava"" no special shoes needed, since you workout in bare feet. they welcome walk ins, and even if you are a few minutes late, or running on hawaiian time like me... no worries, the class is easy to follow. the zumba classes are really popular too, especially the evening sessions, but don't get discouraged if it looks too crowded, you'll manage to move! ... but come early if you prefer to be at the front of the class. wear comfy gym clothes and shoes. bring water...that goes for anytime you come to the gym...that and a towel is a must!!! most classes are an hour but you'll have so much fun, it'll fly by! it's never too late, you don't have to be a new years resolutioner to come try one of the classes they offer i encourage everyone to get into the ""fit life!"" happy 2014!"
4-star,1,they have every possible equipment you could possibly need to work out. the only downfall to this gym is that its so crowded so if you have a workout routine its hard to follow it because you always need to wait for equipment to free up. it is a lot less busy later in the night around 9-10 but if you dont mind the crowd and waiting for machines to free up this gym is excellent!
2-star,0,this was an okay gym. its smaller than some of their other gyms . so if your trying to lift be prepared to wait. if your looking to do cardio there more machines than you can shake a stick at .
5-star,1,love this gym! professional and courteous staff. impeccable equipment and all around useful gym. staff are competent and equipment is clean and in good repair. great price for a great work out
5-star,1,this is one of the nicer golds gyms in the vegas area. it is a little smaller than the eastern & serene gym. it has plenty of equipment and weights. they keep it clean. it is way to far from summerlin though. they need to open a golds around the charleston & i-215 area.
4-star,1,"first of all, i've had memberships to lvac, la fitness (when i lived in california), gold's gym and planet fitness. so when i write this review, it's about the actual gym i currently go to and my experiences in comparison to other corporate type gyms. i enrolled a little less than a year ago with no expectations. simple gym, i knew my way around it and i knew what to expect from it's clientele. i had no major issues except for the fact that is was not disclosed verbally that there was some kind of ""account maintenance"" fee of $60. since hubby and i signed up at the same time, i was kinda shocked to see the $120 hit at the same time. come to find out, that fee is in the contract that we sign upon signing up. pros: 1) always clean, never and issues with the overall cleanliness. now, i've worked out at several gyms throughout the valley and if anyone thinks this one is dirty, then go to what i call the ocd gym (planet fitness). i felt like people were more focused on sanitizing their machines than actually using them for fitness. 2) extremely friendly staff. never felt pressured to buy anything/add on services, etc. i've always been acknowledged by someone and never made to feel like i didn't fit in. 3) the childcare is amazing!! the first couple of weeks of putting my little one in there kinda freaked me out - - but now almost a year later, i look forward to the hour and a half or so where they play with her and give her great attention (as with all the other kids in the playroom). never had any problems with them. in fact, i belong to several mommy forums on fb and through some posts, have heard not so nice things about childcare at other gyms. i personally know 2 people who have moved gyms because their children were either traumatized at those gyms or hurt and no one seemed to care. the childcare staff are always so friendly and sweet. 4) if you know how to use the equipment, you can always find a machine no matter how crowded it gets. some people assume you can only use certain things (like the squat rack). maybe they need 2 squat racks because there always seems to be a wait for it. but seriously, if you can't afford a trainer, google info on how to use machines - you'd be amazed how quickly you can go through a workout without having to wait for others...and only to complain that it's too crowded. 5) trainers (well at least mine) seem very professional and informative. but i think finding a trainer is like finding a doctor - you gotta keep looking till you find someone that works for you and understands your needs. also, they're actually personable. when i worked out at lvac they were independent and man, some were so unapproachable, they were kinda intimidating. 6) not a meat market!! if anyone calls this place a meat market, then obviously they have been to at least 2 of the gyms i named above. at lvac i was one of the few women who did squats and deadlifts. here, there are quite a few and i look to them for inspiration because these are not the type of women who look like they're there to pick up a man. just because i said it wasn't it meat market, that doesn't mean there aren't hotties there! still lots of great eye candy!! cons 1) i think the staff should walk around the gym and a few should actually show newbies how to use the machines. yeah you wanna increase your membership but perhaps by showing the inexperienced people how to use the machines without having to commit to a trainer will help retain members. i see so many people give up because they aren't achieving their goals, but don't know where to turn or ask for advice so just...leave. maybe have a ""class"" on how to use machines. then once they figure it out, introduce them to personal training and how effective if would/could be? 2) equipment breaks down frequently. i do see someone always repairing machines, but because the gym is a lot smaller than lvac (which has like a hundred treadmills alone), either upgrade machines or repair in a timely manner. 3) you guys need a smoothie bar. lol. so i don't have to drive to go get one!! 4) wish it had a steam room. :) that's it for now. bottom line, i like my gym and have no issues!!"
3-star,0,"i like golds gym on stephanie because they have this cool cardio cinema...that being said, they do not have the movie list updated on their website (still lists movies for the months of june and it's now august). i called, and was told ""yeah...they don't really update it. they might get to it later this month"". what?? i like to check online the day i want to work out and will schedule my workouts according to what movies are playing. i was told to ""just stop in, and you can see the list on the wall"". come on people, update your online movie list!!"
4-star,1,"this is my gym. been coming here since early 2011. its nicer than the other gold's i've been to in the area. just avoid the 5-7 pm rush if you can. it gets slammed in there. i don't particularly care for gold's gym as a company though, they're kinda sheisty and make everything a pain in the a$$. if you lose your debit card, and have direct payments...you'll see what i mean."
5-star,1,"this is by far one of the best gyms i've been to. i've signed up there twice now since i was going to college and i've had no problems at all. the girls that signed me up explained everything very and there weren't any ""hidden fees."" sometimes it's a bit crowded, but seriously what gym isn't. i've never had to wait longer than 5mins to use a machine/bench/etc. everyone there seems super friendly and i haven't ran into anyone that was rude that works out there or works there. it does suck if you forget your towel though so don't forget!!! leaving a machine sweaty is gross so hey no one can really complain about that"
1-star,0,"back in jan 2013 i visited the s stephanie location to inform someone that i would need to freeze/suspend my account temporarily. i was told by a young lady that it would be fine. i left, unaware that i was supposed to have been given documentation. unfortunately since i never worked for gold's gym i don't know their procedures. a month later i received a bill in the mail for them. i called member services and asked for it to be corrected. since he couldn't help me he transferred me and i ended up leaving a voice mail. no one ever called me back and i forgot about it until i received another bill in the mail. i called member services again and it was the same thing, the initial rep couldn't help me so she transferred me to someone else. i briefly spoke with someone and she said she would look into it and call me back. i never received the call so i called back almost 2 weeks later. this time she was rude about my situation, saying that if i didn't have proof of the encounter (how do you prove a conversation?) that i would just have to pay it. i asked her to forward me to her boss. she didn't but she forward me to another woman, whom i ended up leaving a message. she called back, i explained my situation, she said she would research it and call me back. she never did so i called her back twice and left 2 different voice mails. on the third attempt i got a man's voice mail (it had been changed). i left a message with him anyway, and i still did not receive a call back. i then tried to get the issue resolved through the local level (general manager christopher wagner) via email but that proved to be useless as i had to explain myself three different times about my situation. after i realized i was ""chasing my tail"" i submitted a comment on gold's gym website and someone from corporate called me. she said she would get with the local location and find out what's going on. apparently the location is not cooperating with their corporate because i have yet to hear anything back and i have called her back for follow up (she had nothing at that time). when i spoke with chris today he mentioned that i am 90 days delinquent (which would be $90) yet i, somehow owe them $180. they are also having a third party make threatening phone calls to me, which i ended up having to block because it was that bad! i don't have a problem paying the correct amount i owe, but i refuse to be extorted for additional funds! i said all that to say this: beware. they are very eager to get you in the door and signed up without telling you their guidelines and p&ps, expecting you to figure it out on your own. they snatch your hard-earned money quicker than you can actually make it and won't blink twice about it. they are a business that is out only to make money and contrary to what they may tell you in their ""spiel"" to get your signature they do not care about you as a person, as a member, and/or as a consumer. do yourself a favor and try another gym like 24 hour fitness or las vegas athletic club. i'm sure either can't be worse than gold's gym."
4-star,1,"it the start of another year, and hopefully i don't physically breakdown like my former company's mainframe computer. oh well, i did for a month, but what the heck even a chevy 454 big block engine that fell on my knees a few weeks ago, isn't stopping me this year. the wonders of a great knee brace, bromlein, and a few other natural inflammatory had me back into a gym. i have to admit a few years ago, i wasn't a fan of golds because they always had message of something waiting to be repaired on some of their most popular machines, but after that one week pass a few months ago, and watching how quickly the maintenance personnel are on the fix. this is not a problem for me. the misconception of golds is that the majority of their members are bunch of roid raging meatheads who love looking that themselves in the mirrors. i believe lvac has more to those types in the free weight room, and this golds location is now getting more mom's, high school students, and general population that wants deals, but not get locked into a long term contract. also, it's not a meat market, because most of the guys just want to workout, and get the heck out of there. in other words, it's not a social club, like other gyms. back in december, i signed up for the 14.99 special, and i'm enjoying this gym quite a bit. the membership package i selected gives me one guest pass each day, and i can walk into any of their las vegas location. there also a 9.99 month to month deal, but your stuck at this location, which isn't a bad thing at all. for both of these plans, you still have visitation passes for their other golds gyms around the world. something that the meat shop on eastern/215 can't not match up. so if you do travel outside of nevada, this is another bonus. the gym has everything you need for a workout, and what i enjoy the most in the workout area...the television are put up high on the wall, so they won't break my concentration. but there are a bunch of televisions in the cardio area. i have to admit, there less machines than lvac, but a few years ago, i never use machine at all. how time, and age has changed that, but golds has enough machines to keep me happy. what got me to sign the dotted line for this gym was the cardio theater. i never ever thought the concept of watching a film and spinning away would greatly cut the effort of burning calories. the room is the size of a very large screening room, and has a mix of bikes, stairmasters, and treadmills. good grief, i was forced to watch ""twilight"" one day, and even that made the cardio easier to do. thankfully, my friend's daughter was there with me. and told me the ending of that movie, sorry, i wasn't about to sit for that entire vampire movie, and see a bunch of hybrid dogs and bats battle it out for some woman. gold isn't a bad deal at all, but at&t reception does suck in the area; so i been having a hardest time checking in for yelp. if you have any doubts about this gym, just get a 7 day pass...it's doesn't cost you anything to check it out for a week."
4-star,1,"i really like this gym. provides a lot of classes. convenient, hassle free. body compat was awesome. no complaints really. the price is reasonable and i feel at home there. its not snooty or intimating like david barton gym and it has everything you need"
5-star,1,"having been a member of a national chain gym in the past, i was a bit skeptical about joining golds and dealing with the hassle of contracts and parking and busy machines. not so here, i'll say: i love going to this gym! 1. no annual contract: that was the biggest pain dealing with during my last membership at a different gym, i don't know if i'm going to be living somewhere for however many years and canceling is a pain in the ya know! they have good deals at golds, for me it was 19.95$/mo for access to all classes and gyms nationwide and only a $40 yearly maintenance fee - i can deal with that. no hidden fees crap! and i get to bring a friend free every time i go to the gym, i have taken advantage of this option almost every time, and it's really great! 2 for 1 and workout with a friend! my friend likes it so much, he's getting his own membership! 2. cardio cinema - what else is there to say, this is so cool and such a fun easy way to get cardio in!! i wish it were open past 10 pm and it is annoying to have to stop my workout to ask them to reset the movie, but i'm being picky now... 3. good classes, i've done body combat, yoga, yoga bootcamp (rasa is awesome, i wish this class was offered more!!), zumba, body pump and some others, they are all great! seems to be a good community where teachers recognize you and they have fun halloween and party kickoff classes. variety of options and times and if i want more, there's always the eastern location... 4. they do a good job of maintaining the place. i've been a member since august 2012 and since then, they have replaced the padding on some machines and also fixed one of the tvs that had been out. i have not tried the showers or sauna, but the locker rooms have always been clean, and same goes for the rest of the gym. there's plenty of parking and even on peak times, like 6 pm on weekdays, there's usually not much wait for a weight machine and i've always been able to find an elliptical in the cinema room. it never feels really busy, which is great! i'm a big fan of this gym, i will be a member here for the long term!"
2-star,0,"so, i call gold's gym this morning asking what time they start cardio cinema. the guy who answered the phone said that he had already started running it. this was at 4:48am. i pull up their website and it shows the scheduled movie was to be twilight. (so, what? bite me!) anyway, i get suited up, and head on over. when i get there, the entry sty is jammed and he doesn't know how to fix it. strike one. i brought my driver's license because i could not readily find my swipe dealy, but i asked him if i had lost it and got a new one, will i still be able to recall the credit i had in the old one. he did not know. strike two. so i made way to the cardio room, and see that they are screening the a-team, yesterday's movie. i go back outside the door to check the movie schedule which is supposed to display the immediate 3 days including the current, and all the slots are empty. no, no strike three yet, although it should be. i go back to the desk, and ask the guy what the next movies were. he did not know, nor did he have a hard copy of the month's schedule, nor did he not know how to go online and check the schedule, nor did he not know today's date. strike 3,4,5. and 6. does that guy even work there? i mean, maybe that's his father's job and he's across the street drinking, and he left his kid there with his work shirt. but that guy definitely does not deserve to be working there, if he doesn't know anything. it's like a waitress not knowing what the soup of the day is, or a doctor who doesn't know how to hook up an iv."
4-star,1,"just the name 'golds gym' has always intimidated me. i had the impression that the place was full of juice head muscle men and that there would be no actual, normal looking people working out. not that musclemen are bad, i just didnt want to be the only gangly armed wimp in the joint. a friend from san antonio absolutely raves about her golds gym, and the classes that she takes there. she is addicted. i almost rolled my eyes at her for loving such a sweaty smelling scary place. until she had me come with her to a body combat class at my local golds. i was hooked. the one hour i spent burning 9 million calories sent my body into overdrive and i liked feeling the burn. another friend of mine and i signed up that very day. my friend has gone back to san antonio sadly, and it took awhile for other friend and i to get on track and actually step foot in the scary place without our tough texas girl. but, we have, and now we understand the addiction. we finally had our orientation session, where we were educated on nutrition, and focused on short and long term goals. i like having goals. their daycare is nicely lit, clean, and the front desk and daycare staff is always friendly. oh, and there are normal looking people like me everywhere. the cardio cinema is a blast, though sometimes i'm glad it's super dark in there when i have a random outburst of laughter when watching the movie. everyone else in their zones. the womens area has great equipment and i love watching women do their squats while watching a water birth on one tv, and watching the first lady on dr oz on the other tv. girl power!"
5-star,1,"not usually a fan of these chain clubs, but i received a pass to try it out. i took a yoga class from a woman by the name of rasa last weekend and she blew me away with her knowledge and the high level of instruction. the facilities seemed pretty much as one would expect, but i used the yoga studio and it was very nice. it even had a nice sounding music playback system and while that may seem trivial to some i, as a professional musician, enjoy hearing music played on a decent sounding system. it is as important as the music itself. studio good, rasa = 5 stars"
5-star,1,"i love yelp and use it before i try anywhere new. i am not very good about reviewing places because i am a busy mom and student. as i was catching up on a few reviews that i have been meaning to write i thought about the places around town that i absolutely love. this gym is one of them. i have been a member since they opened in january 2008. i am shocked by some of the other reviewers comments. this place is so clean, well lit, and open. i have never had to wait to use a machine, find parking right up front and the childcare is wonderful. my girls love going to the gym to play with friends and do arts and crafts. the instructors that work in the fitness room and spin room are the main reason that i go here. they are so encouraging, and inspiring that i have been able to remain committed to fitness and consider everyone i meet there a friend. maybe i shouldn't write this review because the last thing i want is this place to turn into lvac."
5-star,1,great location near my office. i visit it 2-3 times a week and location always has enough space. the stuff is always friendly and helpful. sauna is always at the right temperature
5-star,1,"awesome gym, staff, and environment. clean and organized. best commercial fitness facility in the area. a total of 6 squat racks, 7 bench presses, numerous machines and open space concept allows for a comfortable workout even during rush hour. tons of natural light near the massive cardio area allows for a great vibe."
5-star,1,"i am rating the spin class with andrea at interchange. she instructs the most challenging, high energy class i've experienced in awhile. her music is on point. she is also innovative and keeps her spin class quite interesting. i look forward to this workout on sundays."
4-star,1,"i had some time in between work and a staff meeting, so decided to hit up a gym in my work area and make my downtime worthwhile ;) i obv checked yelp to see which goodlife was bigger, cleaner, etc, and this was the one that i decided on. i am not a goodlife member anymore - transitioned to the community centre gym about a year ago. however, i did recall some things i missed - and didn't miss, today. the good: -big! this location is huge! has a ton of machines and weights. i can't imagine any one ever needing to wait for a cardio machine. -clean! aside from the random balled up towel in the fountain in the women's change room, this place was spotless! very inviting! -free - member appreciation month meant guests were free. sweet deal and nice surprise! -juicebar - i have never seen a goodlife with a juicebar before. but it was helpful since i knew i wouldn't have time to grab food before heading back work. i got a mango protein shake and the woman was very accommodating. she showed me the protein powder so i could ensure it was gfree, and told me what else goes in. it was surprisingly good for a protein drink and cheap! $4 for a small (cash only btw). they also had protein bars and other drinks like gatorade. the not so good: -muscleheads - these guys dominated the entire free weight area. i get it, you have big muscles. but grunting, shouting and dropping weights is really unnecessary. and if you can only do one rep before dropping the weights, maybe it's a sign that they're too heavy. also, taking 15 minute breaks in between your sets of 1 rep is inconsiderate. the free weight area was somewhat small compared to the rest and a big chunk was dedicated to free weight machines. so the benches were hard to come by and occupied by the aforementioned people. the front desk staff - kinda rude and standoffish. nothing more than the general greeting and that was even in a bored, dismissive way. ah well. regardless, the two negatives are not enough to drag down the positives. i wouldn't hesitate to go back."
4-star,1,large place makes finding available machines easier than goodlife's smaller locations. i find their staff here aren't as friendly above and beyond the greeting as you walk in. its awesome that goodlife fitness gyms are open 24hrs with someone at the desk 24hrs. this location is always fairly clean and the classrooms (group exercise/ cycling) are well kept.
1-star,0,"i used to go to this gym regularly for years but moved to the city. decided to go today because i had a bit of time and was in the area. on my way out, i decided to use the washroom first and when i made my way to the stalls, i realized that the floors had just been mopped. i was a few steps to one of the stalls when the cleaner ordered me to walk over ""there"". i said ""where?"", she got frustrated and said there!!! i said, ""but i need to use the washroom."" she goes, ""did i tell you not to use the washroom?! i told you to walk over there!!!!!!"" wtf?! never have i ever been disrespected and for what?! when i had calmed down a couple hours later, i decided to call the gym to tell the manager and make a complaint. spoke to a woman named kelly who proceeded to give me a bit of attitude and told me she was there when it happened and the cleaner wasn't yelling at me. really?! what do you call that then when a cleaner ordered you and continued to yell at you when you just retaliated because you felt disrespected. and to make matters worse, she was there and yet she did absolutely nothing about it? what kind of a useless manager are you?! needless to say, i reported the incident to head office."
1-star,0,"the amount of humidity and mould in this place is unreal! located at a basement underneath hillcrest mall makes this place always hot, humid and smells like mould all year long. i stayed at this club as a member for one year, while on a contract, i had to actually sign up at another club and pay double the monthly fees, just because i couldn't handle it over there! at a gym, it's essential to have a good air ventilation/cooling system to keep the air flowing, to assist in breathing for a successful smooth workout. this was not the case here. the size of this gym is fairly small, with a good size of the free weights area, but very few weight machines and only few cardio machines (treadmills, ellipticals, etc...) the group workout/classes room is nothing different than the above, it's maybe 700-1000 sqft max, and it gets really crowded in there, with the humid and smell of the walls, you can only imagine the situation in there..they usually have few fans on full blast, but don't really help. same applies to the locker rooms, being small so it gets hard looking for a free locker, and cleanness is certainly an issue in that area as well. goodlife is a great brand, and i'm a fan of one of their other locations, but this one is really at the bottom of the list in my opinion."
2-star,0,"i am not a fan of this goodlife. first of all- basement gym. it's a no from me. there is no reception whatsoever so people hang around on the staircase or upstairs trying to grasp that tiny bit of lte that they can. body vision across the street is a basement gym as well but they have full reception as well as provide full free wifi - something goodlife should look into, especially when they charge so much more. equipment here is plentiful but not sure if you'd want to use a lot of it, as nobody wipes their sweat down and half of the stuff feels grimy and unclean. the squat racks are almost always empty or barely a wait, which i approve of. there are lots of equipment for you to get your whole workout in, and lots of benches that remain untouched as well. lots of things here are always free - squat racks, smith machines, benches, cardio machines ..it's as if everyone gathers around the dumbbell jungle or something. there's always some sort of a ..unclean smell here. staff are nice for the most part and even more nice if they know you, from the way they treat their regulars with kind conversation to the quick hello, goodbye i get from them. eh, hours aren't even great either. don't really see a reason why i'd willingly come here, unless i had no choice."
2-star,0,"maybe two stars is a little harsh. let's say two and a half. this gym has a number of issues that makes me wonder how it's stayed open for so long. like most other people who grudgingly go here, i dislike the dungeon-like feel of the windowless basement. the showers always smell musty even though there is always someone cleaning them out. the spinning room is always dark for some reason. i've tried turning on the lights but someone always comes in and shuts them off. the cardio machines are old and they have super tiny tvs. the staff at the reception desk are not friendly at all. they don't make eye contact when you approach them for help. they don't greet you like at every single other goodlife on the planet. they chat amongst themselves and with their friends who hang out there and ignore everyone else. so why do i come here? well probably because for extended hours there's not any other options in this area. there are couple of things i like about hillcrest. one is the women's only room which i only just discovered in the last year or two. if i want to do a quick workout, there is always a treadmill free in here and free weights all to myself. it feels like i'm working out in my basement at home but it gets the job done quick. plus for a more serious workout, the free weight area can't be beat. tons of benches and weights. other than that, i'd rather drive another few minutes south on yonge to the thornhill goodlife."
5-star,1,"the experience i had with them for four years it amazing experience, had committed gym trainers and had great classes. it was my first to started for experience to know on my journey to started on a was like. it give best start but for over timed, i didn't needed a personal trainer to know what and excetcise fit for me. than in time i didn't really need the experience on class started beach body work give also results too and it had helped my card while watching tv on trade. so i switched to fit for less which give good with hydro message, discount on drinks, it excluded but i have my own for cheaper i chosed fit for less in the future i might come back."
1-star,0,"this club is going downhill under new management. i've been coming to this location for close to a decade, and it's turning into a planet fitness. the only thing it is missing is a lunk alarm... the club is in the basement with very poor ventilation. the change rooms are small, stinks, and dirty most of the time. the only reason i come to this club is that it's close to my house, made friends with people here over the years, and the power/squat racks are decent. through all my years, using chalk has never been an issue at this club but currently with the new manager there is a witch hunt on chalk. the new manager is very duplicitous on laying blame on other members complaining about ""chalk"" use. since the power/squat racks are well away from all the other workout areas, and i see no reason for anybody who actually go near that area to complain. like i said, i've been here for years, and never had a problem. in fact the serious trainers in the past use chalk themselves... for now out of respect i will switch over to liquid chalk (colourless liquid grip) so the manager doesn't have to police anymore, and he can spend more time on the computer surfing the internet... serious lifters will always be here, staff come and go, when this happens people will start using chalk again. in the end, i see really no point in alienating long time members who actually put there weights away... please concentrate on things that will improve the club. ie) clean change rooms, educating douche bag members to put their weights and towels away after use.., bolting large gym equipment to the floor so it does not get moved, and take space in the aisles. thanks... joe"
1-star,0,"i wish i could go back in time and activate my corporate membership elsewhere. this was the most frustrating experience i've ever had with a fitness centre. long story short, i spent over a week waiting for my gym key to arrive. i didn't want to annoy them so i asked every couple of days for an update on the key situation. after waiting over a week, i find out they ran out the morning of! i was furious!!! this location just wasted my time and left a sour taste in my mouth. i was only able to get my key from another location... all it took was a 2 minute explanation on how the hillcrest location screwed me over. so for those who are planning to activate their corporate memberships, i'd recommend you go elsewhere or else you will spend a long time keyless and constantly asking them when your gunna get the damn key."
1-star,0,"can i give this place negative stars?!?! this place is the worst goodlife club (at hillcrest mall) i have ever been to. incompetent employees and managers and on top of that you get no reception on your phone (not that you really need a cell phone during your workout). so movember and goodlife partnered up together for men's health. so i created a mo space to join the 30 day movement. charity and fitness together for a good cause. me and my friend went to this goodlife location to start the movement. unfortunately, this guy jay gave us the hardest time. he was giving us a tour of the gym, talking to us about personal trainers, and membership rates. we just wanted to do the 30 day movement without being heckled. we used a guest pass about 3-5 years back at that location, and because of that technicality jay would not let us use the gym. talk about a son of a beach. way to represent goodlife and show how they feel about charities. the manager was fully supportive of jay and everything he had to say. worst part was jay was a tiny scrawny dude. you think if you were trying to sell gym memberships and personal trainers, that you would at least look like you use the products/services that you are trying to sell. #hittheweights i hope that other locations are far from providing the poor customer service that this goodlife club is providing. way to show me why i didn't like extreme fitness or goodlife gyms to begin with. @goodlifefitness jimstar out!!!"
1-star,0,"i was very upset with the way hillcrest mall goodlife did not care about the wellbeing,safety and cleanliness for their customers. lockers falling off hinges, nearly hit another customer in forehead,toilets dirty, towels all over the floor . i reached out to management for help fix the locker so no one else gets hurt. management said to me he couldn't look at it because his training was more important. after numerous complaints to head office they made no effort to try to keep me as a customer. my wife and son went to cancel was told they needed to cancel with a manger they made arrangement and the manager decided to not show up leaving no instructions for the staff. my wife drove down for nothing. my advise, do not join goodlife they only hire kids to run the place and socialize. all i asked was to change gyms as a good will and head office said i would have to pay more money. goodlife head office ended up waiving my $100 cancelation fee and said goodbye. i ended up joining another gym near by which is 100% betters than goodlife."
4-star,1,"if you ever wanted to go back to the past and experience what's it like to be sprayed with a firehose in the 60's race riots in america, this is the place to go! the water pressure in the showers is so strong it can knock a young child unconscious! i take freezing cold showers in the morning, do i dear try it here with so much water and in one of the coldest days in canada? yes i did! and it quite an experience, good? not sure but it was different. despite the new equipment and lots of it, it's not a good place to work out. i find that the ceiling is low because it's in the basement and everything is too tight together. but are you really thinking about working out when there's this awesome shower there?!"
3-star,0,"i like to come here on the weekends since it tends to be less busy than other goodlife gyms. the floor space is smaller than other gyms but it does have a bar, pool and sauna. it has a lot of cardio machines and unique weight training machines. i wish it had more squat racks and flat benches. one flat bench has been ""under repair"" for several months even though it looks fine. there's also no real space to deadlift and the free weight area is kinda small. overall i'd recommend this place during weekends but i'd probably hate to come here during busier hours."
1-star,0,"i'm a little upset about this gym. i usually go to a different one: first of all they give passes time to time and second they have a really good customer service, staffs are amazing (east mall, etobicoke). but this gym here, makes the goodlife company look really bad! i went online and saw that goodlife charge 14$ for a trial of 14days. that's fine but when i go to the gym with my cousin (who's a guest in toronto), they wanted to charge 15$, 2sec later another guy came and said: ""ok i'll be the nice guy and charge you 5$"". i mean that sound more like they really don't need to charge anything but they just want to make extra for some reason. it's really not the 15$ that bothers me but the principal of charging 15$ or 5$ for what exactly when other gyms gives passes away or online we can get a 14$ trial for 14days. i mean c'mon guys are you that desperate? it disgust me, first and last time i'm going there!!"
5-star,1,"one of the nicest good life clubs around. it is located in a former industrial building, but they did a nice job renovating the interior. this location appears to have all new equipment, and its not too crowded. at least when i was there. there is also a smoothie bar. not sure on the pricing, but they advertised a deal where you get a card and 2 free smoothies if you buy 10. they also have a small pool and hot tub. there is also plenty of free parking. all in all, it was a great workout experience here, and i will probably frequent this location again."
1-star,0,"i truly wish i could give a negative review!. omg. now here's the deal people. this was....*****was******* a gold's gym!. i was considering the purchase of a membership with gold's gym. its extremely close to work, it took them a year to finish it, its nice n' side, has a cardio theatre, not bad on the weights (could do with more...but its not bad)....i was quoted $66/month no contract. paid on-line...etc.etc. much my shock....the gold's gym is now....a goodlife! wtf!!!!!!.....good life sucks &^@!!!!!!!. their downtown locations have no flow, not enough equipment, and often are multi-leveled. i have had extremely poor relations with good life. sad to say, i will never bee back in that gold's /goodlife facility again. extremely disappointed!!!!! buyer beware: goodlife has lots and i mean lots of little add on nonsense things, and little clauses here and there in their contracts to keep you hooked...for life!. min. 1 year nonsense. fail!"
3-star,0,"i haven't been to a gym in years, opting to spend my time playing sports. but we came here because we had 7-day passes from when this location was owned by gold's gym, but as of december 2012 this place is a goodlife fitness. a few amenities of note: - plenty of parking outside. - a playroom for children. - a swimming pool and hot tub. - large lockers (larger than the space that airlines give you for carry-on). - a basketball hoop. - showers. about 40% of the open space is occupied by cardio machines (they have since removed almost an entire row of treadmills). but almost all cardio machines have built-in tvs, an iphone/ipod dock and usb charger. i can watch tv while i run? i am sold! apparently you can also search google and wikipedia, but i didn't try it out. the rest of the space is evenly split between weight machines that work on various muscles and free weights. we tried a number of the weight machines and they were all pretty good, except the leg curl (i think we're too short). one of the most interesting things that they have are machines specifically for stretching. there's one specifically for hamstring stretches that will lift your leg up and measure the angle. there's another one for hip flexors, etc. the location didn't seem busy during the last week in december when we used our passes, but was fairly busy on our last day (jan 2nd). the equipment and locker rooms were pretty clean. there are classes that you can attend, like yoga or bootcamp, but we didn't attend any. there is no open wifi connection, so no yelp check-ins on an ipod touch. we did not end up buying a membership."
5-star,1,"i wish every gym i dropped into while travelling was this good. very well-equipped with:3 squat racks, 4 benches, a long dumbbell rack, at least one of every weight machine a normal human would need (glute-ham included) and a mobility section with bands, balls and rollers. lots of cardio stuff too and a room for group classes which i didn't use. everything was in good shape and clean. large, locker and shower room with an ironing board & iron in the men's. and not at all crowded on saturday afternoon."
4-star,1,"this is one of my favourite goodlife locations within downtown toronto. it has a chill environment, the staff is extremely friendly, and the club is totally clean no matter what time you go. it's a very chill location and is located in the basement of the building. while smaller, it has a much chiller vibe and resembles a boutique gym. the changerooms are top notch; almost luxurious sort of and are gigantic in size. this gym has never been crowded while i've been here so you basically have the gym to yourself. everything is maintained well, they have bumper plates and 3 squat racks and a big area to stretch yourself out. the free weight section could be bigger but the vibe and atmosphere of this location is what sets it apart from the rest in downtown toronto."
4-star,1,"the gym is pretty small but definitely has the nicest trainers of the multiple locations i've been to in toronto. this is my preferred weekday location as i rarely have to wait for racks, benches, etc. however, there is no good location to deadlifts -- you always feel like you're in somebody's way."
3-star,0,"this goodlife location is conveniently located next to the eaton centre, but since the gym is located in the basement of bell trinity centre, it does not appeal to me at all due to lack of windows. the gym consists of a fairly decent size main gym area, group fitness room, stretching area and weights area with a good amount of equipment and machines. the staff are always friendly and smiling. i definitely felt welcomed upon my first visit and not knowing where everything was located, i was given clear instructions. i can only comment on sunday mornings as that is the only time i come to this location for their pilates class. i was delighted when the pilates instructor was the same person as the one who taught at the goodlife in the eaton centre many years ago. azadeh, is absolutely amazing as each of her pilates classes are different, always challenging and you leave the class feeling taller and stronger each time. plus she teaches proper breathing techniques, corrects postures and provides modifications and advanced variations if needed. not all instructors are as attentive. the changing room is probably one of the nicer goodllife has to offer and reminds me a little of the spa atmosphere. shower facilities consists of individual wooden panelled stalls with rain shower like spray. since sunday mornings were rarely busy, i often felt like i had the whole changing room to myself. i definitely recommend the sunday morning pilates class at 10am with azadeh. you won't be disappointed and i guarantee you'll feel taller and stronger by the end of the class. go give it a try!"
4-star,1,"this is the goodlife location i go to most often. like all locations, the staff really push to sell you personal training sessions when you first sign up, so be aware of that if you want to join. the gym itself is always clean, locker rooms well maintained. there is the occasional machine that is out of service but that's to be expected. there are a ton of cardio machines (almost too many) and a decent amount of weight machines. the weight machines can get very busy during peak hours so if you prefer using them over free weights i'd suggest going during off times, otherwise you'll probably have to wait. i've tried some of the yoga classes and thought they were great."
1-star,0,"i joined goodlife to shave off the 70lbs i gained from a year of inactivity. i made the mistake of going to the 4:30pm bodypump at 80 bloor yorkville. i've done body pump before and put great effort on my form despite being out of shape. the class instructor rudely comments about my rhythm during biceps curls even though i was doing excellent form and rhythm. the thing that really bothered me was later when she screamed (angrily) at me in front of class ""slow down fat guy"" during the push-ups. this is a very insensitive comment and not very helpful. i don't need a fitness instructor telling me that i'm fat. i try to follow the routine so i wasn't off by much. i know my form was correct so she couldn't fault me for that so she criticizes my rhythm and insults me to boot. it's traveling pushups -not easy. in fact i could see many people around me with bad form/ rhythm and she targets me. it's like she was purposely mad and discouraging me during the class which she has succeed as i have no intention of attending any class taught by her again -ever."
3-star,0,"this is my home gym...i've been a gym rat for many years and have tried so many gyms, it isn't funny. every gym has its own girks and not so good things about it. it's a standard gym but it's close for me and the people are super nice, sure it needs work but everyone really has their own preference."
1-star,0,"this is the worst gym everrrrr!!!... believe me don't waste your $$$...i incompetent and rude front desk staff, dirty, crowded, no maintenance at all, so disappointed that decided to cancel my membership and switch to extreme fitness and love it!!!!"
4-star,1,"this is my home gym (eaton centre north). i'm a true gym rat and also born in the chinese year of the rat which makes me either 26, 28, 50, 62, 74... i'm not 14 or 86 :d i was also a former bally member (like the reviewer sunny v) before they got taken out by goodlife and extreme. the best part is my membership got grandfathered when goodlife took over so i've got a very good rate. from a corporate perspective, they are a 5 star organization in this aspect of club managing. i have no issues with their policies and how they treat their members. most of my fellow work out friends are at extreme which is both good and bad. bad is i do miss hanging with them at the gym and my jaw muscles are much weaker but good is i actually get a work out and i'm out much faster. from a social perspective, this is more of a corporate club as members are courteous but not chummy. you'll always get a few oddballs (ie. smelly, dirty or strange like the tranny who likes to wear his thongs to do a strip dance routine but he's recently moved elsewhere) so if these are your thing you may have your senses aroused. overall a good mix and plenty of eye candy if that is your thing too (both guys and gals). 4 stars here. equipment and facilities is definitely 3 stars and dropping. the club is about 10 years old so it badly needs a face lift. the size is about 18,000 sq. ft and the free weights area is a tad small. the aerobics room is a decent size and the rubber flooring was installed over the old wood floors when goodlife took over a few years ago. unfortunately that was the extent of the reno and here i give the management only 3 stars. the spinning room has an old bouncing floor (not sure if that is good or bad for you) and the yoga studio is a bit cramped. they brought in a few machines when they took over but everything is rather dated. lockers are on the small side and they do have a steam room and showers (i don't use them since i live nearby). i've been to some of their older clubs and if goodlife has a fault, it is they do not seem to bother updating their older clubs. i've been to several of their other gyms (yonge-st. clair, manulife centre, bloor park, liberty village, coxwell-gerrard, 2 queen or also known as eaton centre south). liberty village is a beauty but too far for me. the trainers here are ok but a few are not as professional and lack friendliness or turnover is rather high but that's typical of all health clubs. i'll assume the compensation is the likely the issue here. overall, i would give this gym a rating of 3.5-4 stars but dropping due to it's age. rumour has it they are building a new flagship location nearby... to be confirmed in 2011."
3-star,0,this use to the old bally's corporate gym. since bally went belly up. goodlife bought most of its gym. the gym is located on the 5th floor. i wouldn't say the gym is super clean. it has some funky smell around. especially when you walk it. you get use to it after few minutes. :-) personally i just go in and do my work out and leave. i never do cardio and joint one of those class. the spinning class looks fun. but i think i will die if i go to one of them. lol i am skinny enough i don't need spinning class. i got the chop stick figure who needs to do cardio or any classes. :-) that being said. they do have different classes. i wouldn't join the spinning class not you get a lot of chubby people in there. the freaking room stink. yikes. this gym use to be the best for bird watching. i guess since they open one on king west all the good looking birds are gone only the ducks are left in this gym. cheers.
4-star,1,i really like the steam room here :) this is a medium sized location. i like going here sometimes. again i've found a couple of the class instructors not up to form.
5-star,1,i've been training here for just under 3 years and i love it! the women's program is fantastic allowing women of all levels to improve while feeling safe. i also love that classes are frequent and you are well informed of any changes so i can work them into a busy schedule and balance the rest of my life!

5-star,1,best gym. great instructors. great team. love it here. join as soon as possible. you learn amazing technique in one month that most schools take 6 to teach. the staff is great and helpful as well. 10/10.
5-star,1,"my son wanted to try jujitsu and this location was highly recommended. i have family in law-enforcement and was told this place is the best both for technique, encouragement and character building. i absolutely loved our time here! from the helpful front desk staff to the instructors to gustavo himself, everyone is warm and welcoming. this group is interested in teaching excellent technique as well as reinforcing stellar personal character. their approach to student development keeps them winning local and national events. i was a bit concerned it was going to be a group that stressed winning above everything else. the instructors make sure that each student knows the basic techniques really well before adding on to additional training. they are very interested in continuing to build a solid foundation as well as building a foundation of a good work ethic and integrity. i can't say enough good things about this group."
5-star,1,excellent place to learn bjj. the instructors are all very good. everyone i have met here is friendly and the atmosphere is like a family. great place!!
5-star,1,"was in town for the evening and needed a place to train. it was a friday, which isn't a great day for training where i'm from. but here, not only was there a several hour open mat, it was chockablock with purple, brown and black belts. there was probably 25 people there and everyone was safe, skilled and polite. the facility was also great. there were two separate training floors, both quite large. there were also full locker rooms, showers and separate bathrooms. the staff was polite and helpful. i can see why hundreds of people train here on a regular basis. it's a great gym. fyi, the mat fee was $25 for a single day. i found it to be worth the cost. if you're in the area, i highly recommend you check it out."
5-star,1,great place for kids and adults to train. very friendly and knowledgeable coaches. if you are looking for recreational or competition jiu jitsu they have a class for everyone.
5-star,1,"after visiting a few brazilian jiu-jitsu in the east valley i had decided to call gd jiu-jitsu academy. to my amazement someone not only answered the phone immediately, but was extremely friendly and willing to answer my questions i had about possibly enrolling my two boys(6/10) i came down and took a quick tour and was very impressed with the size and cleanliness of this facility. i decided to bring my boys down for a free trial to see if this was something they would enjoy. during the kids class i was very impressed with the coaching staff and the way the other more experienced kids interacted with the new students. after the class had ended, my oldest son ran up to me in the lobby really excited explaining how much he love and felt like this is where he belongs. needless to say we signed up. 6mons later we have seen a huge impact with school grades improving from c's/d's to a's all the way across the board, self confidence is through the roof, core strength is building quickly, mentally developing a thought process of logical and intuitive thinking for problem solving(physically and scholastically.) i have nothing but love and good things to say about this academy, staff, students, and families."
5-star,1,"early bird classes monday through friday. i dont think there is another gym in the area that offers that. also, world class instructions and cohesive curriculum for all levels."
5-star,1,i am a kid and i love this gym its a very friendly inviorment and the coaches help me through a lot they take it slow and make sure you get it all even if we have fun we also know when to be serious there always trying there best to help you learn it also helps with self defence and disoplyn and working with others
5-star,1,"super inviting and helpful staff. the general manager is a plus at his job and it's more than a gym, but a lovely community. highly recommend!"
5-star,1,excellent academy! i had a very positive experience here as i'm from out of town. the owner gustavo dantas is a class act and works very hard to run an amazing facility to train at. the best school in the area in my honest opinion. the environment is great for those wanting to get in shape and learn something new as they offer fundamental classes taught by expert instructors.from what i've seen they have a thriving kids and womens program. they also have advanced classes and competition training for those taking the sport seriously and are looking high level training. great people here and very professionally run school.
5-star,1,"there is no better teacher of jiu jitsu than gustavo. he hammers the basics til they are second nature and give you a solid base of essentials while others will try to teach you super advanced moves that rarely happen. gustavo is the best, you can't go wrong with him"
5-star,1,professor dantes was more then welcoming and super friendly as were his students. plenty of high level training partners and the facility was clean. highly recommended!
5-star,1,hands down the best jiu jitsu in the state of arizona. gustavo is a true professional who is alway perfecting his craft. i highly recomend gd jiu jitsu academy
5-star,1,the best jiu jitsu school that cater for all ages. they have a very good kids program and they have the #1 competition team in arizona.
5-star,1,so happy we found this place! coach kelly and avery are fantastic with my daughter! she loves going here and is learning so much. we've tried other gyms but prefer this one because it's a more family oriented place.
5-star,1,found this place through groupon. coach kelly is amazing with the girls! he makes it funny and enjoyable for them to learn gymnastics. i will definitely enrolling my daughter after my groupon is finished.
5-star,1,"we love gym and fit because it is a fun learning environment. my daughter who is not yet two is always ready to learn something new. she is tumbling, doing the beginnings of flips, learning to balance, hanging on bars, and so much more. she loves it, and i love it!"
5-star,1,this is easily the best gym for our 8 year old daughter. we have been going to this gym for a year now and my daughter has come so far. kelly really has helped her such a great deal and she loves her coach! the prices are also excellent and so worth it! i most definitely put my trust in coach :)
5-star,1,"we like gym and fit because it teaches gage to be patient, to follow directions and to be a good listener. i am so glad we found gym and fit. mr. kelly is an amazing coach."
5-star,1,great place to get your kids started in gymnastics. coach kelly is the best coach you could ever ask for! he taught my oldest child years ago who has gone on to be an amazing athlete! he inspires greatness in all the kids he teaches and i'm so excited that he is now teaching my 4 year old. hands down best place for kids gymnastics!
3-star,0,"located in a commercial complex. operates as a gym and the other half, is basically a private men's club for gay/bisexual men. rooms, steam room etc... average to good looking men . toured the place with friends. interesting but not my scene. i always say, whatever floats your boat. pleasant patrons and staff. clean and well maintained."
5-star,1,"was there again last night. was outstanding !!!!!!!!!! can't believe how many guys are there and all want to have fun. great staff, wonderful movies and plenty of action. it was getting even more crowded as i was leaving @ 11 or so. even exchanged numbers with 3 guys. highly recommend if you want to have a great time"
5-star,1,"i went at an odd hour so there wasn't a lot of people there but the guys i did meet, including the staff were very nice and welcome. could use some updates in a few areas but they keep the place clean. i would go back, at a better hour. lol."
1-star,0,"i tried a lot of gay bath house in los angeles, san diego, paris.. and trust me i'm always honest, this is the worst place i've been! almost everything is used and dirty, i'll won't juge about the customers, just saying very slow and only old people.. but the worst part was the staff! actually on a thursday night there was only one employee.. he was so rude!! no smile, no welcoming! i had a something to do so i had to leave, i asked him to give me back my id (yes they keep your id since you're in until you leave .. why??) and the guy respond to me i'm busy! he was speaking with another customer! i got back my id after 10 minutes and he almost throw it on the floor!! never come back there!! i know there is a sauna very close to this one!"
4-star,1,this was my first time visit here. after visiting other bath houses around the country this is a good go for las vegas. the crowd is older but nice. they have lockers and private rooms. they have several public play areas setup for different scenes. the staff is very helpful and friendly.
5-star,1,"since the blue moon closing three years ago its been hard to find a good men's only place. i think i found it here. i've been to entourage across the parking lot from this place and its not as much fun. how can i describe it. the steam room here is kicking on all cylinders and is awesome to sweat it out. the showers are across the hall from the steam room so perfectly placed. the gym is great because there's almost nobody in there. its fun. add in the clothing optional factor and i'm a fan. ideally for gay men, or some straight men if you don't suffer from fragility of your masculinity."
5-star,1,i didn't see much of the place but i went when they had a bbrts party and met the hottest guy there. after about 15 mins we were back in the privacy of my room. good place to meet guys.
4-star,1,this is a grittier version of entourage which is on the other side of the parking lot. it's always kept clean but the playroom is hot and so it the darkroom. yes this is a gay bathhouse so you'll see some adult body parts and men on men action.
4-star,1,"hawks gym is a ""mens club"" . the other reviewer is either nieve or not understanding of what that means. the gym part is secondary to what it is. if he had wanted to use a real gym, las vegas athlethic club is right beside it. ths 30 a month. enjoy. this is a bath house. nothing more nothing less. the men are more mature ussually. much better than the other place in town."
1-star,0,"before going to hawk's gym, i knew that it was both a gym and a private club to hook up in. i'm gay, and i wanted to check it out, not because i wanted to hook up (that's not my thing), but because i wanted to try the gym and be able to look at the other hot guys while working out. when i first stepped in, i could tell it was like a seedy night club because of the ambiance (and i was there in the middle of the day). i was in line behind two old perverts and in front of an impatient effeminate twink. the scummy old porker behind the counter looked like he'd worn the same clothes for at least a few days and hadn't showered in a week, and he was one of the rudest people i've ever encountered. he was clearly annoyed when i asked him a few questions about the gym, like i was interrupting him from his sitting on his lazy fat ass. after letting the two older men in, the pig behind the counter asked if i wanted a locker or room. i told him i was new to vegas and was curious about the gym. the annoying guy behind me sighed impatiently. the guy behind the counter rudely told me that there are no tours of the gym because it was against policy. i asked him about the membership. he said that membership was $15 for 3 months. i thought it was a great deal! i told him i was interested in a membership. i mean, who can beat that price, right? unfortunately, to get into hawk's gym, you have to purchase either a locker (for $10) or a private dressing room (for $25). if you're a member, you still have to pay for either a locker or room! i asked the guy if i could not purchase a locker or room and just come in my gym clothes and work out, and he said i couldn't because it's against policy! so to work out here (let's say 20 times a month), it's going to cost you at least $200 a month. that's absurd! but this is also a place to hookup. so technically, you're paying for sex (illegal!). i was pissed because i just wanted to join a gym to work out and look at the other hot guys."
4-star,1,"my first time rock climbing in years was awesome! we bought a groupon for 2 including all day passes and harness rental for $30 the night before and headed in on friday morning. we had the place to ourselves and after a quick video and instruction on how to belay we were off on our own. the facility is clean and spacious and was being vacuumed the entire time we were there since some climbers use chalk. there were plenty of walls with different levels of difficulty to try. they have partner climb, individual climb and also bouldering areas. it's definitely a work out but enjoyable for any level of fitness. let's just say i've been sore for several days and i'm not seeing and end yet!"
5-star,1,"came with a friend because they had a great groupon deal. we had so much fun here! i will definitely be coming back again with other family members and friends. my only complaint is that i wish there were more auto belays, but other than that it was a great time! also the staff was very friendly and helpful!"
4-star,1,"this place is awesome!!! brought my kids by way of groupon and the folks there were super helpful and patient with us first timers! first we watched a video and then demonstrated that we were familiar with the ""belay"" process and then we were set free to climb! the difficulties were varied and we tried everything without injury! we are definitely going back!!"
5-star,1,"i bought a groupon here for a full day of climbing for 2 for $22.00. it was well worth it and a great way to try new exercises. they have guides that give you an orientation tutorial, and teach you how to be the climber and partner with the rope, although for the most part they were pretty hands off - i guess you could ask them for help if you needed it or if there was an emergency they would be there. the staff were all very nice - the equipment worked well, and we used our own tennis shoes which were fine for climbing. i like how they have the ""difficulty"" level marked on each course with numbers so you can gauge what to try next. i would definitely consider a membership and coming back here. rock climbing is so much fun!"
4-star,1,"it was our first time here and we will be back for sure! the staff is excellent. very friendly and knowledgeable. the facility is very clean and well maintained. while we are very.much beginners, it appeared there were varying levels for all expertise. a very fun afternoon!"
4-star,1,"this was my first time rock climbing and i had a really positive experience. we had a groupon deal and it was definitely worth it. when you walk in you get greeted and they ask if you have done rock climbing before. you then sign a few papers and watch a video. someone watches you to make sure you put on the equipment correctly. once you are done with all that, you are free to roam! they had a lot of different styles/levels. it was fun to try all of them. we didn't have to wait for anything to climb since the place is so large. there is also drinks and snacks if you want to purchase anything. we were there for about 2.5 hours and it was so fun and worth it! we would definitely go back again!"
5-star,1,"fun for all ages! went here today (using their groupon) for the first time and had a blast. took about 20 minutes to watch a safety video, learn the harnesses, etc. and then you were free to climb as you please. i highly recommend going in pairs or else you will have limited options of ropes or need to have a stranger that you can pair up with. however, i saw two auto hookups where you could just climb on your own. climbs are labeled by difficulty so you have a heads up what you're getting yourself into. got there around 3 on a saturday and it was pretty crowded. most ropes were in use. however by 4pm there weren't many people there. i would recommend going early or later on in the day. will definitely be back."
5-star,1,"both locations are fantastic facilities with friendly and helpful staff that facilitate a truly welcoming environment for climbers of all skill levels. routes and problems are great, well-maintained, and change regularly. the south end location is impressive, to say the least, with much higher walls, expansive bouldering, and great sport opportunities, including several auto belays (especially useful if you are not yet qualified to belay on routes that are not pre-rigged). south end is geared more towards climbers with some previous experience (regardless of age), which is a much needed and welcome addition for those who take climbing a bit more seriously. there are still plenty of opportunities with bouldering and auto belays if you are a beginner. climbing is an awesome way to get kids active and excited about the outdoors but if your children are inexperienced and not into climbing as a sport, you will probably be better served by visiting the monroe road location. this location is better geared towards those brand new to the sport, as they have several beginner-level top rope routes pre-rigged with gri-gris that you are qualified to use after a 15-minute lesson your very first day. regardless of the facility, you will want to keep an eye on kids, as the facilities are not heavily staffed and the actions of some rambunctious youngsters can end in injury for them and others. i have seen many times where parents allow their kids to run through the gym without caution, climb without ropes on areas that are not for bouldering, walk/run underneath climbers, and climb up on down climb only areas. these are all huge things parents need to ensure do not happen to contribute to a safe environment for everyone. but not to worry, readers, for as many wild kids i have seen, i have seen triple the amount of kids who have been taught their gym etiquette and safety, are spending awesome quality time with their family, and other kids who completely and utterly crush better than myself and a ton of adults. the community of climbers at inner peaks is extremely friendly, welcoming, and ready at will to help you - whether it be belaying for a solo climber or sharing knowledge about gear and climbing spots. at the end of the day, i cannot recommend inner peaks enough."
5-star,1,"i went to inner peaks with three others for some afternoon fun. it was a friday and we were 4 of about 9 people in the place. after signing some waivers, we watched a short introductory video and got to climbing under the supervision of one of the employees. once we'd all practiced a few times, we were on our own. the last time i climbed was about 15 years ago and took a while for me to get the courage up to climb higher than 4 feet off the ground. i wish we'd had more time, because just as i found my groove we had to leave. there was a good variety of climbing options for novice and expert climbers. definitely give yourself time to get acclimated if it's been a while. a fun way to spend time indoors for kids or adults!"
1-star,0,"i came here with a friend to use a giftcard that she gave me few months ago back in march. we could not use the giftcard, because they could not find a recent transaction on that giftcard. my friend immediately checked her bank account and saw that they charged her for that giftcard back in march. my friend did everything she possibly can to grab a hold of someone who can help her settle this matter. however, their employees and even the manager couldn't be efficient about this. even the manager couldn't be any sincere about what had happened. one of the employee mentioned how this happens oftenly. this is something you should not be proud of or even mention to your customers. i wonder how many disappointed customers who purchased a giftcard walked out of their doors. you've got to be extra extra careful when purchasing a giftcard here. much attention needed since they will charge you for the giftcard but not even put money in there. we are both upset and very disappointed that we both had to go through this. my positive view on this place has changed, especially the way they handled this matter was not professional at all."
1-star,0,"very disappointed! have been going to inner peaks for many years and have brought many customers to the place. i bought a giftcard for a birthday and recently when she went to go use it, they said there was no purchase history on it. i bought it in march and thankfully had purchased it with a card otherwise they would not have been able to find it and credit the visit to the giftcard. this is most definitely an employee error and i wanted some sort of voucher for my friend since this was unacceptable. the manager was very apathetic and did not care that my friend had gone there just to use the giftcard and had to pay with her own money to buy the pass. from the view of the person who bought the giftcard for a birthday, i was very disappointed and embarrassed that she could not use it. what also flabbergasted me was that the employees there said this happened often... am i overreacting or should this definitely should not happen again. so for now do not buy giftcards until they train their employees to do their jobs correctly."
5-star,1,"i've never been climbing before, but i went to the yelp quirks out event earlier this week and loved it - the instructors were super helpful and made learning how to use the ropes and belay your partner easy. i also really liked the social atmosphere - every climber i encountered was friendly and willing to give out tips. there were lots of climbers, so occasionally we had to wait for one of the easier routes to open up, but in general the facility was spacious and had a ton of options. now i just need to convince all my friends to come climbing with me!"
5-star,1,"first time rock climbing, looks easy but its definitely not, it's a great upper body work out. bouldering was so difficult definitely got to be in great upper body shape. i had a blast and the place was pretty cool nice staff."
4-star,1,"i've only been to climbing gyms in the dc metro area, and man, is this place different! in kind of a nice way. + compared to any night in any dc metro area gym, this place almost feels deserted there are that many routes open. not crowded at all, spacious. + they use a few gri-gris and have 2 auto-belays. unheard of at gyms i've gone to! i think this is great for folks that are new to climbing. and it also means there seems to be more routes for folks with atc's! + at least 2 routes with cracks. + the walls themselves are thoughtfully constructed, i.e. the edges have grooves that can act as holds, which makes it fun and more of a simulation of an outdoor experience. love it. ~ long orientation for first-timers, but i like that it shows that they're really concerned about safety. however, annoying for experienced climbers that don't want to spend 30 minutes getting situated. - one of the 5.6 and 5.9 routes were definitely switched. it was the first route i tried (the ""5.6"") so i was like, geez, nc routes are hard! and then i tried the route next door (the ""5.9"") and it was clear the signage had been flipped. - priceypricey. $16 for a day pass. well, you're paying for those awesome routes and walls, i guess. i wish there was a student discount or pass package or something, since charlotte's a student town."
5-star,1,"inner peaks is the place to climb in charlotte. the staff is excellent and is the climbing community! they are always trying to make the facility better for new and seasoned climbers alike! never been climbing before? don't fret! the staff at inner peaks will take good care of you. there is a short orientation video, tour, and training to make you feel comfortable. the have rental gear to make sure you have everything you need. just wear comfy/athletic clothes. seasoned climber? there are 2 top-out boulders, bouldering walls, lead cave, and plenty of top ropes to suit your needs. there is also a workout area and climbing training area. pro tips: mondays are 1/2 price day passes for guests climbing with a member. wednesdays are college days. discounted day pass and gear rental with a college id. there is also a great power flow yoga class offered on wednesdays (included with the price of admission). second location coming to the southend in 2015!"
4-star,1,"i've been going to inner peaks off and on for seven years or so. what impresses me is that every few years they renovate, expand, freshen up or add something new. no, that's not a list of all the same thing- they have done each individually over the years. the indoor climbing area includes: 1. beginner walls 2. bouldering and lead cave 3. free-standing boulder 4. more advanced routes (lead included) 5. moon board 6. slackline and training area 7. upstairs cardio/weights (full dumbbell set, treadmill, bikes, kettles, etc) 8. yoga studio with classes at 6:30pm 2x a week 9. stuff for the kiddos- birthday parties and climbing team i guess now i need a number ten...monthly memberships includes yoga + climbing but this is a great place to learn about climbing on a rainy day or take a second or third date. if you have a buddy that's a member- monday is where it is at- you'll get in for half price with them. this is a solid gym for nc - the walls aren't the tallest but they are constantly improving and striving to make climbing accessible for those looking for a fun thing to try and for those training for their next outdoor send."
4-star,1,"great gym. love the space and the walls. they have slack line also. many different routes for beginners to advanced climbers. on weekends it's usually not so busy. atleast that has been my experience in the 5 to 6 visits in the few months. they have few auto belay routes with one or 2, 5.10 routes. so it's good to climb as a solo on some harder routes without a belayer as there is auto belay. the bouldering section is huge with plenty of overhang routes. everything is good except one thing. the bulletin board to find climbing buddies or belayers, is not very effective. there are rarely any advertisements by other climbers for buddies. looks like people come here after they get hooked. it's difficult get a call or request through the bulletin board for climbing buddies. so you better have someone to go with or ask around the gym to catch you. i usually go solo, and ask around. haven't had much luck finding regular climbing partners through the advertisement on the bulletin board. that's why i am giving this gym 4 stars rating. else everything is cool. one more thing: staff is very friendly and have happy faces. climb on!"
5-star,1,"it has been years since i've been to inner peaks, so i thought now that i have a two year old i would experiment and see if he liked to climb too. we walked in and the manager was super helpful and thought it was a great idea to see if our little man liked to climb. he even said to not worry about the day pass because who knows if our little guy would even like it. i was shocked because that never happens at businesses! now thats customer service! so he got our 2yr old all suited up in a full harness and off we went to try a wall. well sadly my boy wasn't feeling it and the manager told us to keep trying and he would check on us in a bit. after trying a couple different routes, we tried just letting him hang on some low jugs and that's when he started to have fun. for some reason he didn't like being attached to the rope. but after a few minutes he was done. so we came to the front and i thanked the manager again for his help and allowing us to try it out first. we will definitely be back and the climbing wall in our son's room will be the next project!"
4-star,1,inner peaks is an excellent place for indoor climbing and for training for serious outdoor climbing. there is a knowledgeable staff as well as equipment for rental. only negative is that it gets a little boring after a couple of hours unless you are absolutely serious about climbing.
5-star,1,"love this place. i'm nowhere near being a pro or even an enthusiast of rock climbing, but inner peaks makes it amazing. every time i've had the pleasure of visiting, the staff has been funny and super friendly. willing to show you around the facility and introduce you to all that they offer. one of my favorite things at inner peaks is the different walls. some of the walls are only meant for bouldering and others are for top-rope climbing. great to split up the areas as it can get super busy and super fast. my absolute favorite thing about the gym is the slackline. i've been a slackliner for several years and love that there is always one set up (unless there is a class going on in that area) and super easy to use. if you're a regular climber and are looking for the killer workout a couple times a week, you'll look far past the coin it will cost you to join and maintain a membership. go with another member first. if its your absolute first time and you go with a member, it's absolutely free! so rad. if you go in on mondays, its half price admission. definitely the premier climbing gym in all of charlotte. love it. maybe one day i'll get a full-fledged membership!"
5-star,1,i can't say enough good things about this climbing gym and yoga studio. really big and well laid-out space. the staff is excellent and very helpful to those of us that are in the learning phase. it is great place for children's parties too. my son and his friends had a great time.
5-star,1,"this climbing gym is excellent. a wide array of bouldering and top-roping problems, some lead climbing areas and friendly staff. their bouldering problems are rated a little higher than they actually are (there are a couple v5s that are more like v2+s...) but i'm generally happy with everything they have. for a whopping $55/month you can have unlimited climbing. generally everyone in the gym is nice; there are some shirtless, washboard-ab boys who can send v6s and higher that will give you weird looks and ignore you, but aside from that you should find everyone is friendly and willing to give you some beta if you ask (or some times if you don't)."
1-star,0,"ive been a member of ip for almost two years (even considering it a second home). i put a hold on my membership for the holidays and decided with grad school that i couldnt afford the membership and really didnt have the time for it. i wrote an email using their contact us form and never heard anything back. next thing i know almost two months later they are hitting me with a $172 charge! they did offer to reimburse one month and give me 5 days free initially. i don't think it's considered ""free"" if i technically already paid for it. the woman who i dealt with said she didnt receieve emails and that i needed to fill out a special form. i am not sure why i was never contacted when i suddenly appeared to not be paying my membership despite the fact that i had always done so in the past- i never climbed once during this period obviously since i had thought everything was taken care of. the woman was unwilling to work with me at all. i did not want to pay for jan (considering its the 7th) - the month literally just started at least cut me some slack there. the customer service is obviously lacking since i have brought them tons of business in the past ( signed up several friends and my cousin is on team now). they did finally agree to take away dec/jan fee's but i am still paying about $70 just because they apparently never received my email. oh and i was also told not to return because i ""hung up."" how is that for friendly service?! it was one of the most frustrating calls ive made in a long time. i know they have let ex-employees who were fired due to drug related activities continue to climb so i have to feel a bit offended that i am banned. i will be going to the white water center or outdoors for all my climbing kicks. be careful if you sign up for a membership- and send emails via your own account so you have copies- i learned a huge lesson here."
4-star,1,"came here on college night and daypass + shoe rental = $16. not bad. the venue is very large with tons of climbing space. lots of different routes and great courses of bouldering. there was a good crowd with people of varying experience levels, which made it more comfortable for the less experienced, i.e. me. the place is rather difficult to find at first. it's through a parking lot behind some buildings. i'll definitely be back once i build up some upper body strength..."
4-star,1,nice place and the staff is very willing to help. you have to watch a safety video first to get the hang of it but the safety harness stuff is pretty simple...it is climbing the rocks that is hard. i took my daughter there and for the climbing and equipment it cost about $25. she loved it. the location is kinda tough to find it is in the back of an industrial park so you have to watch the signs and go slowly. i've seen birthday parties there so it looks like the take care of kids pretty good also.
4-star,1,"a very coo place, with plenty of indoor rock climbing walls. i first went there with my brother matt. he dragged me there, because he'd been there before and said it was pretty awesome, me, well i was a little scared of heights. but not anymore, thanks to innerpeaks (just kidding i'm still scared of heights, but that's what makes life exciting, right?) to get started i had to rent the climbing equipment, including shoes, harness, belays, etc, i think it came to a total of around $25. then it was go time. i was a little nervous and i guess the guy at the desk could smell fresh meat, cause he asked me if it was my first time, and i cannot tell a lie, so i told him it was. then they took me to a nook of the main floor, which is like a gymnastics floor covered in huge rock climbing walls. it smells of chalk and the floors are soft and covered in carpet. i was walked to a corner of the room, near the lockers and watched a video about the proper climbing and belaying procedures, always be in communication with your belay partner...""climb on""! then it was off to the walls...inner peaks has a ton of different walls for varying skill levels. i started with the beginner walls which have a slight slope and aren't completely vertical like some of the intermediate walls. after summitting the first wall i was exhilarated,overcoming my fear of heights and using my brain and muscles to find my way to the top. so i moved onto the bigger walls toward the front of the place. it had more difficult grips, spaced in a more challenging way, after some effort i made it to the top of this wall, as well. rock climbing is an awesome sport, great exercise, challenging both mentally and physically and it helps you use all of your muscles, especially your legs,fingers and forearms. but that could also be because i'm not using the proper technique. either way innerpeaks is awesome, not only do they have some hard core walls that wrap around the entire interior of the building, but they also have little stations where you can work on your grips, techniques and strength training. and there is a whole section devoted solely to bouldering, like rock climbing, but closer to the ground and without the need for a lot of the equipment. that means its a lot cheaper to just boulder. but that also takes away the thrill of climbing 30+ feet in the air supporting yourself on nothing but tiny plastic grips and your own determination. so for me it was worth it to pay the $25, get a nice work-out and feel the thrill of being alive and pushing boundaries. innerpeaks is a great place, check it out, its also the only indoor climbing facility in charlotte. they offer classes and programs for all skill levels. rock climbing is a great activity to engage in with your friends and family,(perfect place to take the kids) what better way to build camaraderie than by pushing the limits and living on the edge (all in a safe and controlled environment)."
5-star,1,the best exercise place i've been to. is actually quite fun too. you get such a great workout. the staff is so nice and welcoming and really helps you. is your own pace which is really nice. love it and i will never stop coming here.
5-star,1,"i started looking into jabz when i saw them on groupon. i tried one location and liked the concept, the workout went by so much faster than i though which i liked...but it just wasn't feeling like a good fit there. then i found the north phoenix (shae and 32nd) location and it was everything i wanted it to be!!! i am newly into working out, new years resolution, and really was looking for something i could get hooked on. i wanted to find something i would stick with longer than a week and a place where i was challenged but which also wasn't intimidating to the point of feeling embarrassed and wanting to quit. the trainers at this location are perfect!!!! they are always ready to help you if you forgot the exercise at a location, will modify stations to make it easier or more challenging, and they are always kind and encouraging!!! they are my favorite part and i'm so glad i found this location!!! the other girls that go are also super helpful and positive...an even better bonus!"
5-star,1,"i started jabz before the holiday season with a groupon and became hooked! i signed up for a three month membership, and have not been disappointed so far. i love the set up, you don't feel overwhelmed and i personally feel comfortable which was a problem for me with other group fitness classes. the coaches are very encouraging and help you out when you're not doing a station correctly. everyone is really nice. i leave there feeling accomplished and definitely out of breath!"
5-star,1,sam is the most welcoming and energetic instructor i have ever had !!!!! the atmosphere is awesome and the workouts make you sweat!!!! i love how everything was explained and you never feel like you're lost and confused. i highly recommend this studio for ladies who want to stay fit or who are just starting on their journey. the all womans atmosphere is helpful and great.... everyone seemed inspired by each other. i can't wait to come workout here again!!!!!
5-star,1,tried a coupon membership for 30 days at this club. loved the space. the trainers are great. sam really works you hard. interval training can be confusing at the beginning but there was always someone will to help. keep trying. i went twice a week and used all my muscle groups. it was a good tired. loved punching the mitts with the trainers because they changed up my punching rythm and challenged me.
5-star,1,"i have been going for a few months now and am super excited to say i am down about 20lbs. all of the trainers are great and really care about you. sam the owner is wonderful! they have great deals on facebook and groupon for your first month! they class sizes max out at 16 so there is a lot of personal care and attention. classes are an hour and based around stations so the hour goes super quick. if you have been looking for a place that's fun and hard all at the same time look no further. my favorite thing about it is the care and attention of the trainers though! i broke my leg a few years ago and have to modify some of the moves. the trainers are always showing alternative ways to do the exercises and they care! julia, katrina, gina, rachel no matter who's training i know it's gonna be a fun time and definitely worth it in the end!"
5-star,1,"jabz is amazing!!! sam and the other trainers are so fabulous and keep you motivated throughout the tough daily workout. they mix up the exercises so it's never the same, i get bored easily when working out and i definetly don't have this problem here. there are a lot of different options and modifications to the exercises that make it possible for anyone to do. i highly recommend jabz to everyone!"
5-star,1,"i work out at the jabz fitness on 32nd street and north of shea. being that i have literally worked out solid since i have been about 20 years old and now that i am ... sigh.. in my 50s.. i have done all types of workouts in my time. this one is awesome! i was getting bored with my regular weight training routines that i do and i really like the challenge of this workout. it is all women (and they are of all ages/weights) so i think for most people it is a very comfortable, stressfree workout. but don't kid yourself... it is pretty hard. my abs have gotten a lot tighter as a result tho! the other thing that i like is that you can really change or minimize the workout for any injury that you have. i have had 4 knee surgeries and i have been told that my left knee is like 80 years old on the inside. who knew? lol.. so that means that i have to be super careful with what i do as now it is about maintaining that knee for longevity rather than being the toughest or fittest (that was the old me!) . with this workout, i can minimize my running/jumping/bending which is super important. other workouts (like orange theory) are great for those who can comfortably do all that stuff. the other thing that i like is that all the girls in the classes are very supportive of each other and encouraging. that is what we women need! and the instructors are fantastic... just nice people who push you when you need to be pushed. the owner is a woman and i like supporting other business owners like me! btw, i have also worked out at the jabz on scottsdale road, and it seemed to be a trifle more difficult. personally, i like that more but it is a farther jaunt for me to drive..."
5-star,1,"i was a tiny bit overwhelmed going into jabz but i'd purchased a groupon because i was looking to shake up my boring treadmill routine and this place looked interesting. i'm so glad i didn't get in my own way! pros: super friendly and knowledgeable staff and trainers new facility great energy/support from fellow jabzers (i just made up that word) a truly kick-ass workout. while i was watching the demonstration i thought, ""eh.this looks easy."" um. yeah. not so much. you go at your own pace but if the trainers see you slacking, they'll challenge you. i loved that. cons: the north phoenix location only has bikes and jump ropes for warming up. i'd love a treadmill and/or rower option. overall, i really enjoy this place and plan to continue until the ""wave-goodbye"" flab is gone!"
4-star,1,"the one star off is because i can never get into the am classes - they're always full. i prefer working out in the morning and right now, i'm going in the afternoons. which means that i don't go as often as i'd like due to my other obligations in the afternoon. with that said. jabz rocks it and kick's my a$$ - pushing me in all the right ways! the trainers are knowledgable, great with modifications and making sure people are keeping good form. and i greatly appreciate their motivating attitude! it's important to note that it's not a boxing gym - it's a circuit training system where you get to punch a few bags. i bought the 15 session groupon and i'm on my 9th day. even with enjoying this workout as much as i do, i don't know if i'll continue because of the morning conflict. however if a 5 or 6 am class isn't important to you - then i highly suggest you stop in and give this place a go!! the support is fantastic as is the workout!"
5-star,1,"jabz is a fantastic high energy engaging workout. it is themed around boxing and keeps you engaged with different workout combos every day. there are between 14-16 stations for the full workout. you focus on each station for about a minute keying in on high intensity and high reps! the trainers are amazing! they get to know you personally, offer support and encouragement, and push you when you need more! the class environment is very friendly and welcoming. there are women there of all different types, shapes, sizes, and fitness levels! jabz is a great option whether you are looking to just start becoming active or if you are looking to shake up your workouts and challenge your body! bonus...they offer a free trial week and often run groupon deals! i love it!!"
5-star,1,"i struggle with being consistent in working out, but this place makes it easy! each workout is new and challenging which makes me want to go every day! this is such a well run and clean business! the trainers are so personable and push you so you get the best workout for you that day! i have gotten some seriously awesome results because of these wonderful work outs! and getting my frustrations out on the bags each day make it that much more fun! you gotta check it out! they offer a free week! no excuses!"
5-star,1,"i tried the free week 6 months ago and only went once and wasnt feeling it but i was also not feeling physically well. after hitting a plateau at the gym and being too lazy to drive to my zumba classes. i decided to give this place another try, i am so glad i did! ive been going every day for the last 2 weeks and this place makes me sweat. the gym or zumba never made me sweat the way this place does. the trainers are great, friendly and push you to your limits. i am also glad that this place is a block from my house no excuses!!"
5-star,1,i started with a groupon back in january and have been hooked ever since! i go to class at least 3-4 times a week. the instructors are all great and will help you achieve that next level that often is hard to do on your own. i've lost almost 15 lbs and have so much more energy! this is one groupon i didn't regret buying!
5-star,1,great workout! i great staff. they are very friendly and helpful. i love that it is close to my house and that the hours work with my schedule.
1-star,0,"do not sign up for this gym if you're planning on using the bootcamp/""k-fit"" room in the back. the room's floor is full of holes from people dropping the weights. it is simply a safety hazard to use their facilities: you risk seriously injuring yourself if lifting any amount of weight in there. they use subpar material for the floor and have not replaced it in over 6 months. they've actually received replacement pieces, but have it sitting at the lobby for the last couple of weeks. not in a rush to fix it at all! our class usually spends a couple of minutes before every workout trying to find what part of the floor is safe to stand on without stepping on any holes. it's surprising to see a gym whose staff cares so little about the health and safety of its clients."
3-star,0,"grand local plusieurs etages, vitrée, piscine exterieur, sauna, cours de groupe, section privée dans le vestiaire des femmes pour les poids ... funny."
5-star,1,"this gym is walking distance from a metro. it's 24/7 and has great and fun classes (including outdoor classes) such as k-fit, boot camps, spinning and so much more. the vibe of the gym is young and fun. you can go there and train like a beast, or have some fun with friends by the outdoor pool on the roof. the staff is super friendly and helps you with everything you need. the prices are amazing for what you get and all in all, it's a lot of great services that at any other gym will cost you over 100$ a month and the prices here are more than half of that. there is amazing trainers that can give you any assistance you need and they answer any questions you have. really worth have a trial and seeing how you like it!"
1-star,0,this gym is terrible. much of the equipment is either broken or not setup (including any of the fun features they try to sell you when joining).a little cleaning of the equipment that is functional wouldn't hurt.
4-star,1,"i like the fact that the gym is open 24h/7 days a week, great staffs, place is clean with an outdoor pool, big enough i always get my workout done, the only funny thing it's the dirty version of hip hop music that you can hear sometimes playing at the gym lol ..that's actually get me going ...twerk twerk .."
5-star,1,"this is one of my favorite locations to workout at. the staff is very friendly and always greet me upon entering the club. the management is very passionate about helping others, and you can see that they take his/her job very serious. i'm very thankful that this gym is very close by my house and would recommend all my friends and family to give it a try. one of the best gyms in the valley."
5-star,1,"i've been a member of la fitness about a month and a half, and i've got to say i'm lovin' it! i purchased the personal training for a year. it's been so awesome, super challenging but so worth it. can you say bikini body here i come?! i've been trained by vlad who i highly recommend. he's super nice and has great exercises. rob is my main trainer who is equally as wonderful. he really pushes you! they really listen to how you would like to transform your body, and guide you from there. it's been a great experience so far, and i can't speak enough about both these guys! recommend them times a million!"
5-star,1,"i've received training from the staff at la fitness on greenway and 7th ave. howard has been very helpful to me by teaching me about my target heart rate, the amount of exercise time i should expend to break through burning sugar in my system to burning fat. he has shown me the best ways to exercise that will bring me the most benefit. i highly recommend him and his staff."
1-star,0,"update- i spent 4 months trying to get my money back. after june they no longer were supposed to charge me for personal training as the one year agreement was over. they continuously ignored my requests to cancel and steal my money every month. for 4 months, craig the incompetent manager promised he would reverse the charges and never did. i spoke to him on sept 25 and he told me the reason they hadn't refunded my money was because the regional manager was away in the army and they have 25,000 members (umm how is that my problem?). i gave it one more chance and he promised to call me the next day to update me. guess what...never called! i finally am resolving the issue by myself by reporting this criminal activity, canceling my credit card so they can no longer fraudulently charge me. be warned do not sign up for the one year personal training.....because after that year is over they will continue to steal your money and they wont stop until you have to turn your life upside down and handle it yourself."
1-star,0,"disgusted with how i was treated. my buddy and i came in to check out this location as we tried out the la on 32nd st bell rd and there wasn't a lot of amenities. they gave us guest passes for the one on 3rd st and greenway so we could try out their amenities as we would need to get a membership regardless that allows us to go to any la fitness due to business traveling. damien the salesman was a terrible disaster. he came at my friend and i like we were cheap pieces of crap and that ""we couldn't get anything for free"" mind you the guest passes i had got were expired and never used and they still made us feel like we were total crap. i am beyond disgusted and was ready to get the family pack for this gym so my family can come as well. my company pays for our gym memberships so we could've had a great nice big family package but damien wouldn't even allow us to tour. will never return."
3-star,0,gym is big with lots of equipment. down side is it is very stuffy and smells like body odor sometimes when it's really crowded. this place definitely needs more ventilation or fans.
1-star,0,this gym is gross. it constantly smells like bo atop that...they don't even have wifi. wtf?? everyone has wifi! super annoying. i used to go to a nicer one in scottsdale. this place is unacceptable. there are $10/month clubs nicer than this one.
1-star,0,"below 0 stars!! went in, wasn't really happy with prices so manager dropped initiation fee to acceptable range but i didn't like the monthly payments. so he dropped that down too. i agreed. i was shown around, nothing special, in fact i don't understand how they advertise they have deep water aerobics when the pool is only 5 feet deep.. smh!! received receipt via email 2 days later and saw the charges. nothing as they said. i have no paperwork because there is no contract. i didn't have a calculator at the time to add what they charged me so i trusted them and just paid. i only have a credit machine receipt. called mgr, said i was misquoted and there was nothing i could do. i called my bank. i am fighting this charge, never going back and getting a new credit card. fyi i never used any of their services, so they can't say ""well she came an used the equipment, etc."" very unhappy!! i wish there was a sports center like at a college where you can take one class for a certain amount of time for a set amount of money and leave it at that..at our community college in our small town in texas we could join the sports center for $125 per semester and use all equipment. i just went for deep water aerobics and the pool was 12 feet.."
4-star,1,"i've been coming here for about 2 years now and like it, i feel comfortable with where everything is and always enjoy my workouts without having to wait for machines, as it is a large facility and plenty of equipment are available. i. an only speak for myself but i have not had any bad services so far. front desk staff is friendly, cleaning attendants always emailing, and my friend that i hired for a year ""steve"" is the man. one note i'd like to make is that weights are often laying on the ground, even if i'm there at 4 am in the morning, i see the mess when i am there like the employees the night before didn't make an effort to tidy the place up. part of the problem is the people training there who do not return the weights in their appropriate place, but employees also should take rounds and tidy the place up. i see plenty of sales/trainers/ and front desk staff doing nothing at times, and instead of just standing, may he stack them weight."
5-star,1,"i just love this place. i can walk now, i can jump, i can dance. i can run short distances on the treadmill. i can practice my headstands, i can take a class, i can relax in the spa. i can invite my friends, i already have many friends who are members, and i'm starting to see more people in the community who also love being active. i definitely did not think i would reach today when i signed up, but i sure am glad that i did."
1-star,0,"let's start this review with the sexual predator that's creeping around in the men's shower room. very lewdly flashing himself in the common area between showers; not the run of the mill old man with his dong hanging out, mind you, a bona fide sexual predator bent on showing himself to anyone that walks by. when he was called out, he hopped back into a shower stall but left the curtains open and was back at it in no time. he's got multiple tattoos on his forearms, a cross and something else. 55-60ish, tan with graying curly hair. pot belly. watch your children in this location - you've been warned, the location has now been warned."
1-star,0,"i have been a member at this particular location for almost 10 years but i'm getting very irritated by their staff and i'm about to leave. the front desk girls are beyond rude. i hate dealing with them. sales people and managers.....oh god, i'm not going to even waste my time on them. a friend of mine walked out last night and canceled his membership, i'm about to cancel it for both me and my wife. or i might try a different location, but i'm definitely done with this particular one. i would rather pay little more at mountainside and get treated like a human. i literally hate this place now."
5-star,1,"i'm not a gym person, but i have enjoyed my experience at this particular la fitness. staff are friendly and helpful with signing up. i did a personal training session with r.d. who was excellent. he is highly motivating and encouraging, but was responsive and adaptive when i hit my limit. i felt that a got in a great workout in a short amount of time with his help."
4-star,1,one of the better la fitness gyms in the valley. the four stars is strictly based upon other lafs not all gyms. spacious. the weight section is completely separate from the cardio machines. there are multiple squat racks and hammer strength machines as well as many benches. by far the biggest and best selection of weights and machines out of all the lafs around the valley. no staff complaints. the guy at the counter badged me in and said have a good workout bruh...what more do you need? the locker room and facility was also very clean. i would work out here with no problems any day of the week. those who are knocking this gym need to check out the other lafs and see what crappy really is.
3-star,0,"while i was trying to sing up, from desk girl was really rude, i thought front desk girl supposed to smile and help you with anything you need. i was for the not happy with that experience."
1-star,0,"don't waste your money or time with this club. the locker rooms smell like sewage and the machines are always dirty. the staff is extremely unhelpful...unless they are trying to upsell you. also on a corporate level, god forbid something happens with your credit account and your payment is late...they will blow up your phone. i was at a funeral and my card had expired on my account. i received 26 phone calls in 3 days. if your trying to save money there are better cost effective options. if you like the full service club..pay the little extra and go with lifetime."
2-star,0,"out of all the la's i've been to in the valley, i'd say this is my least favorite. during the cycling classes and other fitness classes i've been to, something is always wrong with the instructor's equipment. it not only frustrates the instructor, but its a complete bummer when i'm feeling my workout high. i'm also a consistent lifter. you'd think with how crowded this location is they'd have enough spare cash to get some updated equipment. they also don't have enough bars for bench, incline & decline bench so whenever it's chest day, expect to wait, and wait...and wait for a bar. do not go here between the hours of 5-8 during the week. i know those are the times when everyone is getting off work but damn, it's packed and you're constantly waiting for machines/benches/racs/etc. hard for me to get a good sweat in during these times, and super-sets are out of the question. unless you're a cardio bunny you'll be fine; treadmills and ellipticals are always open."
1-star,0,"i drove down today since a friend had just moved to the area and started frequenting this location. i went in and spoke with daniel, who rudely explained to me that since i had used a pass within the last month that i could not use another one. i explained to him that my wife and i are shopping for gyms and he suggested i get a membership or pay $15 to workout there for one day. my friend showed up and told them he had been a member for 2 years and that my wife and i were considering getting memberships. the trainer came to tell me that ""this is a business."" awesome ""business"" move turning down someone that can potentially bring in two new memberships. i will never be a member after i see how your treat potential customers...so petty. avoid this place like the plague. thanks for making my gym selection easier."
5-star,1,yoga class at 5:45pm on friday evenings is great! donatella is an awesome instructor. you will leave feeling like you just had a great workout!
1-star,0,"i i signed up with a trainer back in february. i spent almost 2 months observing this trainer and talking to her about goals before making the decision as it is quite the financial investment. after enough time i decided i wanted to try personal training again. while things started off great, after 3 weeks my trainer abruptly left. i was told by the club manager i could cancel if wanted but he wanted me to try working out with another trainer. i gave it a shot and was not satisfied. when i called to speak to rd, the club manager, and express my dissatisfaction and desire to follow through with cancellation, he suddenly reminded me that this was a contract and i couldn't cancel but would have to buy out my contract. this was the exact opposite approach from our previous discussions. after some back and forth and a few weeks of him failing to return a single call i was finally able to speak to him and we came to an agreement that i would not be charged for my 3rd and final month as in my opinion the contract, while binding was not fulfilled on their end by any means. i called back to confirm this and he guaranteed me that i would not be charged. i took his word and moved on. just last week i was charged for services i was told i wouldn't have to pay for. upon my trying to call him, not once or twice but 4 times, i have yet to receive a phone call back or a solution to the situation at hand. only a voice mail reminding me that it was a contract and i had to pay for it regardless of my 100% dissatisfaction. i am not one to write a bad review, as this is my first,, however, in my experience with rd, the club manager, i have found that his words mean nothing and they fall flat. he is very quick to make promises with zero return. it is clear that customer service is not his priority. additionally, this situation has made it clear that he is only out to cover his own behind and that he essentially lied to me and his boss about his actions. in hindsight, i very much regret re-joining la fitness. i would much rather have spent the money elsewhere and had a good experience and actual results. i would strongly recommend that if you are looking for personal training with actual results you seek another gym, as la fitness treats you as a number with a dollar number attached. my experience has made me realize that do not genuinely care for their members or their results and they are selling a false program. it is incredibly disheartening to learn that they care so little for their members after a $2000 financial investment of personal training."
1-star,0,"unsafe place for children! this is a complaint my husband and i made with cps. parent of child and myself were walking towards spin class and we observed a man, who has a restraining order against him from the parent of the child entering the child care area. he was requesting for the child to come over to him. the parent of the child immediately ran into the child care area and i followed. i witnessed them arguing and her telling him to not touch or talk to her child. as he was trying to talk to the child i saw the child was extremely terrified of him. he proceeded to keep trying to allure the child over to come to him while the mother of the child protested and tried to get help from the staff. i was extremely concerned that he was trying to abduct or harm the child. the only staff member present was a young girl not knowing what to do. i immediately asked him to leave to step outside. i had to ask 2-3 times while he was still trying to get the child over to him before he complied. he finally did and we walked outside. i told him to leave the child alone and that he had no business in there harassing the child. he has no relation to the child and no children in the child care. now the restraining order has been expanded to cover the child as well. my concern is that anyone can just enter this child care facility with no safety precautions and abduct a child. the child care area is also only five feet away for the entrance with nothing in-between. i contacted the gm of the gym on sunday 3/29/2015 around 10:45am other info: the parent of the child called the phoenix police department cps won't step in to protect the kids either. here is there response: ""we are in receipt of the online complaint you filed regarding la fitness gym. the gym is not licensed by the department of health services as parents are on-site while their children are in care. unfortunately, we have no jurisdiction over this matter and will be unable to assist you"" avoid this gym if you take your kids there. they are not safe!!!"
1-star,0,as always la fitness guys won't let you cancel it with the usual manager not there story. the girl in the front desk(jan 2nd 8:10 pm duty girl) is so rude.
5-star,1,"what a great gym! i was with 24 hour for the longest time. thank goodness i made the switch. it is so clean in here. it's also the biggest one around since it's so new. the staff is very friendly and not overly pushy about sales. of course they're gonna try. that's their job. they offer great classes, a juice bar, wet area, and a sauna in the locker room."
1-star,0,"this location is a joke! i canceled my membership 2 weeks ago and unfortunately i had to escalate my problem to corporate. i canceled online and had the option of mailing the cancelation form or dropping it off by 5 pm. i went in and the manager parag wasn't there, he went home early. so i left it with someone else who assured me parag would do it first thing in the morning -keep in mind this guy never asked why i was canceling my membership, never asked to see what they could do to get me to stay, just said ok i'll give it to him. a little after noon the next day i called to find out the hold up. parag said it's up to him if it gets canceled and he needs to review it first. it's not up to you! at no point does anyone within this company get to decide if i'm canceling my membership. i'm not under a contract. i paid my first and last months up front. you have my money and i'm not giving you anymore. he was unbelievably rude and condescending, he kept interrupting me and was clearly stationed on his high horse. so i called corporate who instantly canceled my membership. the reasons i canceled: good luck working out between the hours of 5-7 during the week, you will wait and wait and wait to use any non-cardio machine. if you wanna prance on a treadmill chances are you can get one easily. but, if you're into strength training...good luck! my biggest problem with this gym is the hours. they close at 8 on sundays and 10 fridays and saturdays. seriously?? the sales reps they call personal trainers are pushy and rude. i was told by corporate they are able to sell individual training courses but according to the folks here they can only do the one year training membership...stop lying to your customers!!"
1-star,0,"so, i have been really wanting a gym membership and i finally made it in to check it out. i was looking for a gym that has lots of classes and a good amount of cardio machines. l.a. fitness seemed like a great fit. it is really hot outside today and i was dying to work out. i figured l.a. fitness had something where i could do a trial period so i could work out and see how i liked it. i want to make sure i feel comfortable working out there. if i liked it i would sign up. this sounds reasonable right? basically, what happened was the guy at the front desk told me...no, i had to sign up, pay sign up fee plus monthly membership fee then if i didn't like it they would give my money back. also, if i didn't sign up today it would cost me more money. he kept throwing all sorts of numbers at me and talking fast so that i couldn't keep the numbers straight, he wouldn't write anything down for me so i could see how much all this would end up costing me and think about it. it was like trying to buy a used car. i hate high pressure sales. also, to insult to injury he said,...""you look good but you really need to tone up a bit."" really? your going to insult me to get me to sign up for your membership today? i think this is a terrible sales tactic. never do i spend money anywhere that insults me. the only reason i currently do not have a gym membership is this sales tactic. so, in a nut shell i just walked out and will never go back. if you like high pressure sales and some guy commenting on your body, pointing out how tone you are or not, commenting on how many inches you need to loose, then this is your place. as for me i really hope to find a gym that is not like this."
3-star,0,"sometimes i feel like i'm here more than i'm at home so it surprised me that i hadn't actually reviewed this place yet. it's one of the bigger la fitness gyms i've been to so even when it's busiest i don't typically have to wait too long (if at all) for anything. there's a huge cardio room when you first walk in and then the weight training is a separate area down a hallway. everything is kept pretty clean and if something is broken the staff is good about fixing it pretty quickly. the staff at the front desk varies, sometimes they smile and are friendly, sometimes you get the teenagers who don't look up from their phones, but seriously do you really want the person checking you into the gym to make conversation with you? their job is to scan your keycard so you can go workout, so how bout you get to that and stop complaining."
1-star,0,they have been billing me for a year now since i cancelled my membership. it is the worst system because once your in it you can't seem to get out. they keep calling you and billing you. horrible place.
1-star,0,"i wish you could leave a rating with 0 stars, because that is the quality of service you receive with la fitness! where to start really...monitor your account, they will try to double charge your account, and make charges to your account that they can't even explain themselves what the charges are from. front desk is extremely rude so forget about asking any questions to the members that work there. direct all your questions and complaints to the gm who is never there, and who never returns your phone calls. i could go on forever on this, but review space here is limited and my main focal point of frustration is their kids care service. please, i repeat please do not bring your child here. if you love your child and care for their well being (as most parents do), do not bring your child here. the people that are paid to watch over and take care of your children do not even interact with them or watch them. instead you can find them sitting in a corner playing on their cell phones or having inappropriate conversation in front of your children with other employees. if your child has any kind of altercation they discipline them by yelling at them and sending them to a corner until you pick them up. now i don't mind disciplining my child my self when my daughter gets in trouble but i will be damned if someone else does it. if there is a problem the parent should be contacted immediately and let them resolve the issue. we provide the gym with both of our cell phone numbers that are with us at all times, and the part of the gym that we never leave. there should be no excuse not to contact the parent as soon as any kind of altercation takes place. a parent should never have to pick up their child who is crying uncontrollably, especially when the employees can't even tell you how long she was ""in timeout"" for. when picking up your child, you do not even have to provide any kind of identification, they go based on a ""we know what you look like"" policy. i mean come on we live in a city of over 4 million people, the odds that there are a few others who resemble me can be quite high. as a parent would you feel safe that just anyone can pick up your child without any kind of identification based on another employees assumption of who you are? this place is hell, avoid it like the plague and do not waste your money here. if you have no other alternatives just please avoid their child care services..."
4-star,1,"compared to some of the other la fitness clubs this one rocks, was very impressed. i am happy it is so close to my house."
3-star,0,love the gym.. but heres the dealio.. dont just sell me a membership.. i still dont know where everything is.. heres why.. the staff never .. nope.. not evah.. gave me a tour.. i had to ask another fitness girl where the ladies locker room was!.. some of the ellipticals need replacing.. but the gym is cool.. so.. theres at least a 3.. staff.. hmmmm.. (no comment!)
3-star,0,"this gym is alright, it's always super clean inside and out. the equipment used to not be maintained but now it is. the only thing i don't like about this place is the staff. the sales people are super pushy and will call you 10x a day, no exaggeration. the front desk staff get real mad when you reach down 2 inches to scan your tag when no one is manning the desk lol. this place also doesn't honor guest passes at all and they try and force your guest to talk to a salesperson to activate your guest pass. that's bs, you pay for guest passes as part of your membership. and just in general all the staff have just unprofessional attitudes and are always complaining about dumb stuff. it's like none of them had any other jobs before."
5-star,1,love to work out here love how there are many different locations near me and my work so i can get a great work out any time i need. super clean equipment as well.
5-star,1,"i have been going to fitness clubs for over 40 years. this facility is easily one of the cleanest and best maintained i have been in. it has numerous amenities and the equipment is well maintained. there are numerous grou classes for all fitness levels as well as personal trainers and a nutritionist. my personal trainer, matt shapiro, has been working with me for over a year and i am in the best shape of my life...great results for a 66 year old. matt is knowledgeable and able to adjust to any ability level and weakness or injury. he is dependable and efficient and has helped me achieve and maintain my fitness level without spending many hours in the gym every day."
4-star,1,"i am giving four stars because i've gotten pretty much everything i signed up for, but there have been nights when i wish it was open just a little later. it's in a convenient location to where i live in the west valley and is never too busy to where i can't get a machine - and if so, it's a short wait. the staff is always friendly and courteous and aside from normal wear, the machines and mats are maintained pretty clean."
5-star,1,angie witte is an awesome trainer! i've learned so much from her. thank you angie for showing me that i really am worth it and i can do it.
5-star,1,"awesome gym!! matt and travis are great!! they helped my son with asbergers to incorporate a new workout regimen and diet. they were very thorough and informative while working with him. my family and i had fun talking with them. the facility is clean, organized and well maintained. i observed no ""out of order"" equipment as well."
1-star,0,"gym is ok, however the trainers' staff is a completely different idea. no communication within the infrastructure of trainers. trainers say one thing and do another. promised education on diet, received none after 3 months. go somewhere else!!! not worth the money that they charge!!"
1-star,0,"shady ass club!!! don't do business with la fitness especially the one is goodyear, arizona. poor customer service!!!! they want your money. that's all they care about!"
1-star,0,"negligent, indifferent customer service: the afternoon of sunday 6 august 2017 i went to this la fitness to inquire about facilities and joining. the young lady at the reception desk was courteous and efficient. she immediately went to an area to the right, as you enter, where there were 3 young men laughing and joking around. she returned and said someone would be with me in a moment. they could see me standing at the counter, but continued laughing and joking, with no interest in a potential new member. the young lady kept looking over at them nervously but seemed hesitant to interrupt their playing around. after 10 minutes or more i walked out, with them still goofing off. i could understand if one employee fell short of standards.....but not three at the same time. if this is the customer service at the time you are trying to get a customer to join, i can't imagine how negligent it must be once they've gotten your money."
2-star,0,"neglect, neglect, neglect. very disappointed with the la fitness corporation. the management and staff are very courteous and professional. there seems to be a methodical plan to recruit members. but i question if they are interested in retaining long term customers. first- the cardio equipment is old and wore out. i have on more than one occasion requested service on several treadmills because the belts slipped. this is no good for my back injury. second- the weight machines are wore out too and (see attached pics) the attached pics convey that some of the equipment needs to be replaced. it should be noted that, to date, the management has not addressed the issue of wore out equipment for months now. coincidentally, i checked the la fitness website and the corporate machine is still churning out new gyms, however, the infrastructure is neglected."
3-star,0,"i like the gym, the classes and the equipment. i am not happy with the salesmen or manager. someone called me to come in for a fitness examination. i didn't think i really needed one as i just came from ca where i belonged to a gym and already had an assessment. he talked me into coming in and to make a long story short, he belittled me by telling me i had the worst bmi he had ever seen and that i could get osteoporosis or diabetes. my doctor told me i have a perfect weight and excellent health. i was very pressured into buying a membership with a trainer and now don't want it as all i do with her is workout on equipment i already use when i come in. i am going to stop payments on all future charges. my trainer was wonderful but i just don't need her!!!"
4-star,1,"i'm happy with this gym overall except for the early closing hours. 9pm on friday?! you should see the crowd walking out when they say it's time for you to leave. not sure about all the reviews with rude staff. everyone seems really nice. perhaps all the rude people are gone or only work the day shift? positives: reasonable prices friendly staff not too crowded big floor plan - open space usually don't have to wait long for equipment if at all (depends on time of day) equipment well maintained nice pool, hot tub, courts cons: hours suck! no wifi - tv's are on fm radio only one heavy squat rack there's not really a good spot to do deadlifts or power cleans. but if you just want to walk on a treadmill, there are a ton."
4-star,1,"i have been a member at la fitness for over 4 years. the gym fits all my needs, various machines and good hours. i only have attended one of there boot camp classes but the over many different classes. after 4 years, i finally got around to having the complimentary body assessment consultation. travis was very knowledgeable and informative. all the information he provided made sense and seemed realistic as far as goal setting. i would recommend travis for this consultation. i haven't committed to the personal training program yet."
2-star,0,i really do like this gym but hate the hours. needs to stay open till midnight at least. most likely will be switching to another w longer hours. sad since i've been with them a long time.
2-star,0,this is not a bad gym nor is it in a bad area. so props on that... my id we signed up yesterday. we were supposed to have a personal trainer show us what we need cause me and my mom are both larger. and the appointment was at 10. the guy said 10 minutes he is finishing up with someone that .. its now 12:14pm and he has yet to come back to us to show us what to do. now he is helping some other woman... so my issue is if you're going to offer a personal trainer. try to have them actually help us with our problem areas. rather than just ignoring us all together. bullshit...
5-star,1,"i love this gym. everyone is super friendly from the time i joined until now. the professionalism and kindness hasn't changed. everyone is willing to help. i especially love my trainer, don. he is so professional and knowledgeable. i highly recommend la fitness, specifically the good year location. i'm just a mom trying to get back in shape and this location is so convenient for me and my 2 young kids. they love the kids club so it makes working out that much easier. if i had to have one thing to complain about, it would be that i wished the kids club had evening hours on the weekends as well. that is my only complaint and hopefully that would be something corporate could consider especially for working moms trying to be faithful in their work out routine and trying to get in shape."
1-star,0,the gym manager is rude and not cool at all please don't go to this gym ! she wouldn't let my brother go in just because he didn't have an id even though he had gone to the other la fitness on dysart without any problem . i got guess privileges for two other ppl !
1-star,0,"just moved into the area and thought i would get some information about the membership since i live just around the corner from here. went in and the manager steve is unprofessional and extremely rude. didn't even look up from the computer to provide information about membership, he just stared into the computer and didn't acknowledge my questions without trying to input my details (like name and phone number). i don't mind providing this info if i like the place, but if this is the treatment i would receive as a potential customer, i don't want to find out what the treatment would be like if i was a paying customer! will not go here and do not recommend."
1-star,0,"do not go to this location . the staff is the laziest most unprofessional group of individuals i have ever met! the manager steve felt the need to put my three year old in time out and ""pep talk"" him without contacting me, all because his receptionist didn't ""badge my son into the daycare"" which is not my problem. however instead of getting off their lazy asses to come find me (yeah because this gym is so massive you couldn't find me in a crowd of 20) he decided to take it upon himself just because he has ""5 kids"" i don't give a crap how many kids you have, you could have 60 and i still don't consent you to put my child in time out and talk to him about any issue. you're a damn gym manager not a counselor . i would also love to add how a manager in a place of business does not want to give his name to me. good thing i asked your lazy social media scrolling employees your name before i left."
5-star,1,i've been coming here since it first opened and have always been happy with this location. never gets too packed anytime of the day and plenty of parking. its not the biggest but still has everything you need.
1-star,0,"don't join unless you plan on staying with this gym forever. trying to cancel your membership is more difficult than achieving world peace. i specifically joined because they have a lap pool but the chlorine is so ridiculously high, it makes me sick. i advised the front desk and was told it's monitored and kept at a safe level. silly me. i guess it's normal to find it difficult to breathe in the pool area due to the overwhelming chlorine smell. it's also normal to be unable to open your eyes under water for fear of them burning out of your skull. and, it's pretty normal to be sick after being in the pool... i think i'll just stick to my dvd's for now. i've made more progress toward my fitness goal in my living room than i ever did at this gym anyway. :/"
1-star,0,"this is my first time ever giving anyone a review, but i felt i had to share... anyone thats planning on opening up a membership here please beware. i signed on 2 months ago, the ""manager"" told us they were remodeling and adding other activities, like racket ball (which is what my son was interested it), he said i could change the membership name to my husband's if i found myself not going often. well today i went to switch the membership name to my husband's and come to find out, 1. im not able to, 2. they are not remodeling/adding anything, and 3. he was not the manager, infact he was just fired for providing customers with false information. i was told to call the corporate office and let them know the situation to see if they could help me with the name change, well corporate told me they could help. ... but i would have to pay $99.00. i asked her why i would be charged for making a change to my account if when i signed up i was told i could, they fired the guy for lying but still want to charge me . again.....please make sure you get the correct information and you review everything before signing anything, it's clear they cannot be trusted, and instead of helping they still want to go after your money."
1-star,0,"called the corporate office to cancel my membership and told i have to contact the local club. call the local club and told i have to come in person to speak to the manager to cancel. i said, i have not been in there in a year (been paying the whole time) and i'm not coming in there to cancel. cancel it now. nope, have to come in and speak to the manager in person during the week between 9-5. i work out of the area and am not available m-f between 9-5. i hate businesses that hold you hostage and will never support this pos place again. i guess i keep paying these crooks until i can take vacation and make it in to see the manager at his convenience. the joke is on them though. i just wanted to cancel my personal membership and leave my families memberships active. now i'll be canceling all my memberships, screw you la fitness."
1-star,0,the employees are very rude. every time i ask for help w/ machines they act like i should already know how to use everything. whenever i ask questions they act as if i am bothering them. they argue w/ their customers. one time i gave my membership card to man at front desk and he threw it back at me. i asked for the manager to speak to the employee who threw the card at me and turns out he was the manager! i'm going to be contacting corporate and suggest anyone who has a membership here or planning on getting one do the same.
1-star,0,the manager here kevin is the worst manager i have ever seen. instead of him doing his job and make sure the club is running right he takes time out to give paying members a hard time about stupid stuff. has to be the worst customer service i have gotten. if you are thinking about signing up just pay a little extra and go to lifetime fitness.
1-star,0,"i usually go to a different location, so this was my first time here, and last. first off when i walked in no one greeted me with a hello and so i checked in and took my 3 year old and 8 month old into the kids care center, there was at least 20 kids in there with 2 teachers, my daughter is 8 months she was the youngest there, as i walked out i asked the ladies at the front desk what was the amount limit of kids per teacher she said 12 i said ok, i went to work out for about an hour and a half and when i went in to pick my kids up there were about 7 kids, my daughter was in a baby swing screaming and crying at the top of her lungs, not strapped in and another 2 year old pushing the swing at its hardest, as soon as i walked in i immediately heard my baby crying and the teacher was conversating with another parent, i picked up my baby and she stopped crying. my son at the time when i walked in was trying to unlock the gate and so he saw me instantly. i talked to a supervisor and he (kevin) seemed careless. i would not recommend this la fitness, not a very good facility all together!! i wouldn't even rate it a one star."
3-star,0,i had a really bad experience at another gym in town so i was hesitant to join another gym. but with the summer temperatures i didn't want to work out outside and this gym is close to my house. they gym itself is a nice facility and includes a pool and hot tub as well as dry saunas. the only thing i would say is unless you are interested in signing up for personal training skip the complimentary fitness intro because all they do is a hard sell on personal training. the front desk staff can be a little grumpy at times that's why i only gave 3 stars.
1-star,0,worst customer service reps i have ever dealt with. they're rude on the phone and on site. about to terminate my membership with them.
1-star,0,been a member since gym opened and it has just gone down hill. kids throwing a football around the gym at the entrance inside. trainer's having inappropriate conversation while on the clock. to bad it use to be a great place to work out.
2-star,0,"i really don't like to do more than two reviews of any given place, but i feel like i should. i went here yesterday (and a few times last week) and i'm not sure what their problem is, but they are incredibly pushy! the last few times i went (which ultimately made me decide to tell/warn people), i have handed over my key card thing they scan and usually hand back. well, the person handling it holds the card (with all my keys attached) and asks me if i'm interested in this, or that (yesterday it was an assessment with a personal trainer). the time before yesterday, one of the guys got me to fill out information on my boyfriend to call him to let him know about the gym. i was under the impression i was going to be given a two week pass to bring home to him, but nope. each time i come here, i've set aside half an hour to 45minutes to get in a work out. i'd rather be left alone then hassled (they don't like when you tell them ""no"" and keep pushing the issue). i've had the same guy at the l.a. fitness on rancho sante fe be annoyingly pushy, ""what're you gonna be doing today?"" ""are you sure you don't want to speak with a trainer?"" but this place is ridiculous! i almost hate going to the gym for totally different reasons than i always leave sweaty and hate the duration of my 35minutes of cardio. this is a 1 and a half star which comes from the place being brand new and having new equipment. oh, and its closer to my house than the other la fitness."
1-star,0,nice facility but i could not get them to stop billing me. my daughter moved to college and it took 8 months for them to stop the membership. they even billed me $49 for the next year fee on top of the $19.95 regular monthly fee. i hate auto deduction fees because they suck the money off of you and you have to give an arm and leg to end the contract. finally the corporate office agreed to stop.
3-star,0,"this la fitness location is not so bad. one of the only locations in the area with rack ball courts. they did some remodeling a few years ago, which made it better. much much much better than the bethel park la fitness. one downfall, which can't really be fixed, is building is concrete with not many windows except in the very front, so it's hard to get good cell reception to use data for music streaming. the group fitness classes are decent and available multiple times a day with a variety of different classes. the locker room is usually pretty clean, but the bathrooms are hit or miss. nothing is worst than being on a public sweaty place & the restrooms being out of soap or toilet paper. this happens semi often at this la fitness location & they could do a better job at cleaning the bathrooms as well. one thing i like about this location is the stand where you can grab a snack, protein shake, smoothie or even buy a towel incase you forget yours and need to shower. super convenient. they offer childcare too for a fee for all you parents with small children. if you're considering a cheap local guy, la fitness bridgeville is probably your best bet."
2-star,0,"i have been a member of this gym for about a year and a half. do not waste your time or money on the personal trainers. they are fine people but they are constantly changing and short-staffed making it hard to schedule appts. the gym could use some updates too, especially in the showers. they remind of my high school locker room. i also constantly find myself waiting for machines because someone is sitting there looking at their phone. there is no monitoring by staff to make sure others are not taking up space either looking up music or chatting on their phones whilst reclining on a machine someone else is waiting to use."
1-star,0,worst gym ever!!!!! i have been a member there for 3-4 years. i have seen them go through some bad times before but this time is the worst. so bad i cancelled my membership!!!! the gym has a real bad odor to it!!!! the management is the worst i ever seen since i been going there. don't waste your money.
1-star,0,the gym smells. people seem mostly there to pick up others. staff is more interested in looking at their phones than being helpful. avoid.
4-star,1,"i mostly go here for ""cardio days"". the spin classes are the best. they have the stair master, that is hard to come by if it's busy. i generally do not lift at this gym because it's always so busy and the way it's set up, the machines are organized in a way that doesn't really make sense. but overall, a good places for cardio with many different machines to choose from."
1-star,0,"they will tell you the support you will get and what you want to hear when you are first signing up, after that you are 100% on your own. also they try to sell you very expensive private trainer classes. don't do it !! during the most common times to go the place is way too crowded....."
5-star,1,"best la fitness location in the entire chain! try the spin classes, instructors are the best and the work-out will kick your a**....i would go into town just for the classes. warning: this is also the fittest gym that i have ever been in, and it would intimidating to someone who is just starting out. after work it gets crowded, and it is tough to find a spot in the free weight area...."
1-star,0,i became a member of this location in 2011. i signed up for personal training at the beginning of 2012. in july of 2012 my trainer began making comments about finding me attractive. shortly after he began text messaging my personal phone to continue pursuing his interest. i complained to management and asked to cancel my contract. i was told i would be contacted by corporate headquarters and it would be taken care of within 24 hours. after 5 days i gave up hope and filed a police report against the trainer after being contacted yet again by him. that night the district manager contacted me to tell me that i have no grounds for cancelling my contract and she won't allow it. i am now being forced to pay $200 per month for a membership and personal training that i am too uncomfortable to use. not to mention the trainer is still employed at this location.
2-star,0,"this la fitness has been through an emotional year that i won't get into. it's got lots of workout machines, a huge 4 lane pool and lots of great people working there. one problem is the pool area always seems to be out of order, sometimes it's the ventilation being down or the jacuzzi not heating up. we've complained to managers and they say corporate doesn't want to pay to fix the problems. ""hey corporate, you gladly take our membership dues every month, so give us equipment that works!"" with that said, i'm going back to my abs workout and wondering why i'm putting myself through this hell called fitness. oh and for some reason when you are standing right in front of this building and try to check in on yelp, it says you are 3 miles away and too far to check in. weird!"
3-star,0,"became a member three weeks ago. so far, i haven't had any issues. will be going to the new one at hurontario and eglinton when that one opens june 1st, 2017."
4-star,1,"this gym has a ladies section which is quite stocked in terms of equipment. women of all shapes and sizes come and use this section. the women's change room is huge here. it even has a hot tub in it. i noticed that whenever equipment is out of order here, that it often gets fixed within 1 to 2 weeks. the other general open area of the gym has lots of equipment. this place is clean and neat. i recommend this gym."
2-star,0,"ive been a member for years and let me tell you, the staff is horribly rude! anything you say or do, they always have something to say back to you. woman bathrooms smell like poo all the time (at the time of making the place they messed up the bathroom, that's what they told me) and never got it fixed till this date. i told them to get atleast like 5 air freshners so we arent dying in there but guess they're too cheap for that. when u are done washing your hands theres no papertowels, why? cause they dont have funds to provide it. they need to just get a whole new team of staff."
1-star,0,"don't sign up. this gym is really bad in so many ways, and has consistently been so for the last several years. it's now 2015 and i'm going to switch to a gym further away, out of frustration. several problems at this gym: * change rooms are not maintained. consequently, it's too icky to take a shower in there. i shower at home in the spring/summer/fall. but in the winter, i want to be able to shower at the gym. so i finally decided to leave the club, even though it is very close to home. * sinks in the men's change room (hand sensor based) are constantly not working. one out of three sinks (the middle one) is what everyone uses. everyone knows that's the only one that reliably works. i've mentioned this problem on several occasions over the last few years. it never gets fixed. years pass. they just don't give a rat's ass. * urinals in men's change room are constantly under some kind of repair. just replace the damn thing at the source of the problem. * like many gyms that are out of touch, they've got a huge inventory of cardio machines that are never fully utilized, even at peak times. conversely, the free-weights and weight-equipment that the membership is interested in, is always busy. * only 2 power racks in this gym, and constantly being waited on. what a waste of time. it's like being stuck in traffic on your drive home. i've tried making constructive suggestions; there's no place to even formally complain or make your suggestion. * i spoke to the operations manager (jacquie), ""hey, can i make a suggestion about needed equipment?"" and she'll shut you down. ""sorry, we only have plans to fix what we have"". i respond, ""but you need more power racks. they are busy even off-peak. get rid of the cardio equipment assets that are underutilized. rebalance your equipment portfolio."". she's not going to hear it. she's the operations manager and didn't even know what a ""power rack"" referred to. no suggestion box either. no one wants to hear your suggestions. * i followed up, ""well, someone has the authority to change equipment. maybe your boss; maybe your boss' boss. who could change the equipment if they wanted to?"" the answer i got: ""no one"". basically, la fitness wants your money, and for you to have no expectations about cleanliness, availability of equipment or equipment that works. and they don't care about whether the gym is meeting the needs of their members. this place needs to get taken over from la fitness, renovated and run by someone else."
3-star,0,"i like la, but not this location. it looks a run down gym, every machine is close to another, it's unorganized as there's some cardio up and down stairs. free weights are in the middle and it looks like a zoo. machines are older than the other las i've been. changeroom is huge and nice, staff are friendly. i just don't like the closeness of every machine and not many of the ones i use to be at this gym. if it's close to home it's better than nothing but i prefer to go to another la."
2-star,0,"this is a ""meh"" gym. i'll list my pros and cons below. pros: -solid staff that will help you when you need help with workout routines, specific exercises and/or meal plan advice -the gym is never so busy that you can't work out cons: -customer satisfaction sucks: i tried to get reimbursed for training sessions i had paid for ....had to jump through loops, call the head office in the states, and i don't know how many wasted hours talking to people ....to no avail. still didn't get my refund. i finally caved and simply used up my remaining sessions -there is an ever-present focus on buying training sessions. although the staff is friendly and helpful, they'll drop the ""you should get training sessions"" line all the time. they will still help you, but you just have to keep saying no to their advances tl;dr: mediocre gym with staff that are always hounding you for training sessions."
1-star,0,"just don't - i thought i'd give the la fitness brand another try as this location was closer to my work. colin, was fairly nice but has no spine in regards to customer loyalty and/or future business with clients. he is apparently the director or manager of the club. went to use a 3 for 3 pass (3 guests for 3 days) and was told i was not allowed to use it as i was a previous member at another la fitness a while back. i had a friend with me, who was also told that he could not use the pass as he was a guest last november at the la fitness in brampton and therefore we both would have to pay the $15 guest fee. needless to say, i told them that if i was paying, i would not be paying them. we drove to the goodlife fitness at vodden, the staff let us in for free and asked no crazy questions and were very polite. they even offered to hold our bags/coats as we worked out as we did not have a lock with us. afterward, no pressure to sign up. literally, showed us the prices and we walked out. apparently, all la fitness gyms are built alike. i told the manager that this was not the appropriate way to do business with a client who had a membership with you for over a year at another location and i would've considered a membership had this experience been better. apparently, that meant nothing to him. don't expect loyalty, cleanliness or friendly service from this brand, frankly twice at two different locations can't be a coincidence."
5-star,1,"preparing for a destination wedding is a lot of work! training with lonnie gave my fiancé & i the motivation, drive, and ability to prep for our special day!"
1-star,0,horrible gym!! do not waste time or money here and if you ever do want to cancel your membership it will be absolutely impossible to do. this place sucks every way it can!
1-star,0,"the only reason for one star is because they cant go lower. my minor son was pressured into signing a contract for personal training. $250 a month. this happened on a friday, his mom went in on saturday and the person who sold him the contract said he couldn't do anything till the regional manager gets back on monday. i guess the employees don't understand a minor can't bind a contract. we never had this problem with mountainside. this kind of bs hurts the fitness industry."
1-star,0,this place is always dirty and the staff are horrible. i don't understand why they even hire people for the front. i usually am checking myself in while the employee is usually talking to friends huddled around the desk or on the phone. no one ever greets you or attempts to break a smile. anytime you try and ask them a question they make you feel like you are bothering them. there are several other gyms around the area with better equipment and employees with great customer service skills. canceling my membership asap.
2-star,0,"this la fitness is prone to get busy especially after school gets out--since it is across the street from hamilton high. downside of this location is that it's pretty small overall, there's only 3 squat racks, basketball court is smaller than normal (basically no 3 point line on the sides), doesn't have racquetball courts like other locations. also have had issues with people at the front desk. been bounced around when asking for assistance when trying to adjust my membership. told by various workers that another person would take care of me, came back on different days because they weren't there. and then finally told that only one person had the clearance to do it and she only works at a time frame when i was unable to come in. ended up going to the other location off of the 202 and gilbert--and their front desk person was much nicer, and changed my adjusted my membership right then and there."
1-star,0,the place is gross. they rarely clean. weekends the garbage just overflows and the men's locker room looks like a garbage dump.managmebt does not care and walks right by it. the machines up stairs are full of hair and dirt from never being cleaned. just a gross gym. i have been to other la fitness that are clean. not this one. avoid
2-star,0,"i certainly been to better facilities for fitness. pro's: close to my house typically not overly crowded the meatheads are fairly quiet and to themselves it's not a bunch of people looking to hook up at the juice bar (because it's probably not open anyway....) nice equipment and plenty of it. it's clean, but i don't use the locker room, or showers. i only use the weight room and upstair cardio machines. con's the water from the water fountain is nasty and only 1 in the entire building? just don't forget your own water. front desk is often on the phone when you walk in and can't be bothered. opens at 8am on the weekends? this was as close to a deal breaker as i could get. if it wasn't 20 bucks a month and 3/4 mile from my house i'd probably have cancelled my membership. lastly, if you have your membership hooked up to a debit card that you lose or have to cancel for fraud purposes.....get ready. you will have a tidal wave of la fitness telemarketers lighting your phone up several times a day. it comes across as really desperate. don't worry la fitness you'll get your twenty bucks, i promise....if i come back."
1-star,0,"people, pleasant enough lazy. usually can get on equipment easily. the bad part is the showers are always gross. floors are dirty and have clean streaks where people track in pool clorine. i was really grossed out once seeing brown stuff in shower but then saw hair dye treatment in small trash cans. there are always clumps of hair and sometimes qtips in drain. i started carrying lysol spray in my gym bag. i complained about dirty condition of the bathroom and showers they said it was just cleaned.!"
4-star,1,personally i love la fitness. it's a great place for me to go right after school. it gets very crowded between 4:30-7 as people get home from work and can barely get on any machines or benches. the place is full with meat heads who are fairly rude but i just ignore them. overall great experience here for the last 2.5 years
2-star,0,"i've been a member for 2 years. 2 stars because i really don't like that they open so late on the weekends (8:00). i've never had to deal with the staff, so no comment there."
2-star,0,"i liked this gym but sadly i have to cancel after only having the membership for a month. when i originally signed on i was not informed of the hours and i work crazy shifts. i just went in for a workout thinking the gym stayed open until 11pm every day except sundays. i get pretty sick if i don't workout after drinking pre-workout, so now i'm stuck & pretty nauseous. the juice bar was amazing too! i'm so upset. i wish i could just get my money back."
5-star,1,"having a great experience at my new gym. the facility is amazing, the training staff is knowledgable and friendly and service oriented. the kiwi juice bar is top notch, as well."
1-star,0,"on 5/15 my friend and i went into this la fitness, i have a membership and i tried to put her on my guest pass for the second time this year. when we went in and they told her she can't use a guest pass for the second time, they tried to sell her a membership card. the guy said they have a sale going on but didn't explain the sale so my friend said no thank you. he kept pushing her after she said no a few times. finally he said it would be $33 a month and she said no because she has a membership at ymca for free and his response is ""what? you can't afford $33 a month?"". that's when i got mad and i said ""she said no."" i will be cancelling my membership from this la fitness because of his comment. that was absolutely ridiculous of him to say and he has no right to assume someone's budget and what they can or cannot afford."
1-star,0,"i've been a member of this organization for several years. i go to a few different locations but mainly end up using this location quite a bit except for within the last few months. the reason would have to fall upon the constant high turnover of staff which results in a serious problem of them being incredibly rude and unfriendly at this location. even their gm greg is absolutely terrible with the members. i've witnessed this time and time again. the front desk girl, maria, is the absolute definition of complete rudeness and all about attitude. talk about a la fitness location going down the tubes for having pretty good equipment, amenities, etc. they are losing more and more members either to other locations or different gyms in general that provide better customer/member service. once you're a member, they don't seem to care about you. i'm considering canceling my membership all together to find a better fit facility to work out at."
5-star,1,mariella has provided me with a happy face and courtesy every time i check in at this location! this is sadly not always the case with some of the other locations. but i digress as this post is all about mariella and her stellar customer service!! thanks gal!!
2-star,0,"just started this week. haven't had unfriendly staff but they don't seem to like to answer a straight question. i signed my kid up for the kids club, the lady refused to give me the print out. nice selection of machines, sauna is nice, pools are over cholrinated and showers kinda suck but you get clean. the folk in the kids club seem nice enough and engaged with the children. about the only staff i don't feel simply see everyone as a walking $."
1-star,0,zero customer service. when you walk in front desk person looks down or talks to another employee. doesnt acknowlege anyones presents. hardly any good classes. employees are rude!! makes me not want to go to gym.
1-star,0,"after our favorite instructor for zumba left, it has been a challenge finding a good zumba class at laf. the instructors change constantly and the management and staff / front desk are unfriendly. i have been member here since it started and had recommended 3 others because of the one good zumba instructor we had. with her gone, this place has nothing worth going back to. unfriendly staff, worst management. the one star is for comparatively clean facility."
1-star,0,if i could give zero stars i would. my wife and i are in the process of relocating to chandler from california and we came into this la fitness because we called and spoke with alan. we told him our situation and he said that he would be happy to give us a 7 day pass while we were town. we were given to greg in customer service and this guy treated us horribly. he said he wouldn't give us a free pass because he always gets of town people coming in and trying to get a free workout. he said we could workout today but after today it would be $15/day. after our workout my wife went back to greg and wanted to explain our situation one more time and he reiterated that he let us workout today and that should be good enough. my wife again voiced her displeasure with his attitude and asked for his name. he refused to give her his name or the number to corporate. stay away from this gym and greg and his horrible customer service.
1-star,0,"nice spacious gym with quality equipment but the cycling classes and nothing like their video . there is no energy in the classes, there is hardly any people . the instructors are not motivating the music is terrible you can't even hardly pedal to the beat of the music because it either too fast away to slow according to what you're doing with the instructor, instructor is not even in sync with the music. do these instructors have any qualifications or they just make it up as they go along? https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=miqu5gohnfi# classes are not even close to what this video shows!!"
1-star,0,"while the club is nice the employees are unfriendly!!! if you don't like your job, leave. let's start with the front check in counter. wth ( what the hell) if you think they are warm and inviting, they are not and far from it. management get a clue. pls. get a clue this is the worst possible display of friendliness or customer service i have ever seen! this is not golds gym like back in the 80ies. this is 2016 please treat people with kindness, friendliness and willingness! the trainers - one guy looks so out of shape and that inspires people? no way today 10/09 the doors did not open until 8:30. late unacceptable!!!! the juice bar opens so late. hello!! how is that servicing your patrons??? it's not. waste of time hours of operations sat & sun 8 am who made this rule. people like to get their workouts done before 8. do you get it. this is a fitness club not sure why i continue with this place. 24 fitness why did you sell to la fitness? please come back... i beg you. do you need a new club manager? i'll apply for the position. the patrons are more friendly that the employees. member services - i can't even comment on that. the whole place needs a training class on how to treat customers. this is not a positive environment. sincerely disappointed!"
1-star,0,"okay, so ...first off i have not been to this location in over a year. when i had attended this location it was simply for the yoga classes, and they were cancelled multiple times. i understand, people get sick ..things come up. my complaint is this morning at 8:08 i had received a call from corporate telling me that my card on file needed to be updated. not news to me because i knew it had expired as of the end of this month. no problem gonna go online and update it. i go about my morning and get on a routine morning business call. at 8:42am just a little over 30 min from my first call from la fitness i get a beep in on my phone call i am currently on from a local 480 # i do not know. seeing as how i am on an important business call i hit ignore. they proceed to call back quite rudely four times in a row. i hit ignore each time obviously cause the incoming call cuts into my current conversation. this is completely unprofessional and unnecessary. they did not leave a voicemail or get the hint until after the fourth time calling. i will not be going back to that location. also, whoever is making those calls needs a lesson in professionalism and needs to drop their attitude before picking up a phone to speak to paying customers."
4-star,1,"i really like this la fitness. since they opened in 2014, i have been a regular at this gym. it's not a big as some of the other la fitnesses, but there is a nice neighborhood feel to it. it doesn't get to busy and they have a nice selection of machines. the staff has always been great. things i like are the juice bar, the large area they have for stretching and the upper level for bicycles and tread mills. my only con is that some of these newer la fitnesses have smaller pools (2 to 3 lanes)."
1-star,0,"i was at this location earlier this week around 7 pm. my wife and i went upstairs to use the treadmills. most of the open ones were covered in sweat. i am not talking lightly. it was though they were sprayed. i went downstairs to tell the manager who could have cared less. his response was ""which one is dirty"". my reply was that most of the open ones needed to be cleaned. he smirked and did nothing. other members came upstairs, looked for a celeb machine, and left. what was amazing to us was the fact that three employees were hanging out at the front desk, including the manager when we left. not one of them ever climbed the stairs to look into the issue. what a joke. after several years of being a member, lifetime fitness is looking better and better. they respond to things like this."
5-star,1,"i love this location. i've been to many la fitness locations in az and ca. they are not all the same. every time i go i see a lady wiping everything down. the whole time and she doesn't stop. personal trainers don't follow you around and push what you don't want. class instructors are really awesome here. so enthusiastic, keep me pushing and seem like they love their jobs. juice bar is so good. skip starbucks.....feed your body something nutritious. the kids love coming to play in there child care. tv's on their treadmill (catch a show while doing cardio). some days i catch a class, some days i'm on the floor, i've even came just to let the kids burn energy and let mama relax in the sauna. whatever you choose to do....this is a great gym."
1-star,0,this is a steroid friendly gym. if you are looking for a relaxed neighborhood workout spot or you are female this is not a good place to go. i was there a few days ago and sat down three mats away from a walking advertisement for steroid abuse. he demanded i move right next to someone else because friends of his were coming to the gym. not wanting to workout shoulder to shoulder with someone else when there was plenty of space available i told him i would move when his friends showed up (they weren't even at the gym and probably did not exist). this enraged him and he got up and kicked a workout ball at my head. on the way out i complained to the front desk. the guy acted like it was my problem. the roid user came over and started screaming at me that he was going to hurt me and to go outside and fight him. the desk guy knew the other guy and was talking to him by first name and openly sneering at me. i saw the same front desk guy today and asked if he spoke to the guy about his behavior. again he was rude and pretended for the first two minutes not to remember what happened! then he said he didn't know the guy at all despite calling him repeatedly by his first name and then he said something about how he weighed 315 pounds. the implication was that i better do what he said. there are a lot of gyms around this one is not worth your time or money.
1-star,0,"i've been a member here since the doors opened a year ago and i go 6 days a week so i feel i have a pretty good grasp of this gym and can provide an honest assessment. here goes: first, the staff who work the front desk are rude, condescending and could care less about your very existence. i've never been to a gym with worse customer service. i don't expect much but when you walk in they never so much as say hello. not a smile or a welcome or ""hi, how are you?"". nothing. they can barely muster the enthusiasm to lift their heads from their cell phones to scan you in and even that annoys them. some just put the scanner on the counter and point to it so that they can minimize their human interaction even further. the pitiful customer service is a sign of extremely poor managment and poor hiring standards. then there is the personal trainers and since i was a trainer back in the day and owned my own business i can't help but watch them from time to time and collectively they are a real disappointment. there are a couple who seem to put in some effort but the majority just stand there with their clipboard and count reps, staring off into the distance just waiting for the client to tire out so they can move on. i'm sorry but if you pay for a ""professional"" trainer you should get 100% of their attention and energy. lastly, the facility is ok. there's enough equipment and variety to keep everybody moving. unfortunately, they do very little to enforce some basic gym etiquette like replacing your weights when you're done. most free-weight machines remain fully loaded as the previous user simply walks away and let's others clean up their mess. there are dumbbells and barbells littered througout the gym as users just leave the weights when they're done. it's sad but there are a lot of people at this gym with very poor gym etiquette and the management does nothing to hold members accountable. if there was a gym closer to my home i would certainly cancel my membership and probably will eventually. for now i put up with the horrible customer service and can only hope that one day one of them will be sitting before me for a job interview where i can return the favor!"
2-star,0,gym is nice and new. kids club is terrible and they don't offer enough classes or times. staff is not that friendly. canceling my membership for a gym with more options.
1-star,0,well. i was happy when i was working out there. the gym is fine. but i mi ex back to san francisco. i cancel my membership. and here start the hell. cancel a month ago. the guy i spoke with never did what i ask to. just to cancel it. and i got a bill the month after. and when i called. every time they transfer to a different guy. they been very rude. and i get phone calls few times a day for the balance that i don't even owe. the meneger say. witch i think it's stupid. oh i am sorry. you cancel your member ship the day i wasn't here. and i am the only one who can do it. really ? silly people
2-star,0,"equipment and machines are decent. they have everything you need. however, the staff are rude and only want your money. gm is a jerk, and all the trainers are the same way. don't expect any hook ups or deals that would actually benefit you. canceled and never going back. mountainside fitness is less busy, and have better customer service."
5-star,1,"we initially joined here because we found the staff to be friendly, attentive and courteous! the facility is in the perfect location and has plenty of great equipment. we love the variety of classes offered as well. brandon the fitness director assessed our needs perfectly! he checks in with us regularly to ensure we are still on track and meeting our goals! we receive expert training from ramsey - he got us started on the right path immediately and has kept us motivated to stick with our work out plans! the people and atmosphere here enabled us to achieve our fitness goals!!"
2-star,0,"i normally go to a different location but wanted to check this one out because it was near my work. first of all, when i walked in the guy at the front desk didn't even greet me and his look on his face made it seem like i was just inconveniencing him. also, this location is super outdated and just plain ugly. not to mention it was super dirty and gross i didn't even want to set my gym bag down. unimpressed and disappointed."
5-star,1,"josh was very prompt in regards to contacting me shortly after i signed up for a membership online. once i met with him, he was informative, friendly, and motivating. i would definitely recommend him for any personal training needs!"
1-star,0,"from all of the terrible reviews floating around in the cybersphere - from google reviews to yelpers - about la fitness in general, and this location specifically, you would think management would intercede and get their act together, but they haven't, probably because they are about to close this location. i've been to gyms that are about to close before and this is about how it looks and acts. against all judgment, i went into this location today to check out their elliptical machines. no one was at the front desk when i walked in, but 2 teenage kids on duty (without any adult supervision) were sulking at desks in a dark corner. neither of them greeted me or smiled at me. finally, one of the kids got up super slow and walked slower than i have ever seen a young person walk over to the front desk and asked in a monotone voice and with a totally bored expression on her face if she could help me. i said i was shopping for a new gym, and i just wanted to take a quick look around and see what kind of elliptical machines they had. she said she would have to have someone take me around. i said that was fine, but that i was really in a hurry, so her person taking me around would have to be super quick. she gave me a really hard look and said it would take 20 minutes. i informed her i would not be spending 20 minutes at the club, i literally just needed to run upstairs and take a quick look at their elliptical machines. she asked if she could get ""some information"" from me and i said no and repeated for at least the third time that i just needed to take a quick look at their elliptical machines. she took two timid super slow steps away from the desk, then two timid super slow steps back to the desk to tell me she would have to have someone take me around. i repeated to her that was fine, but that i was in a hurry, so whoever it was needed to chop-chop. she moved super slow away from the desk again and fetched the other kid who was sulking at a desk in the corner. he came up to me and introduced himself as kamin. i gave him my name and he said he'd need me to sign a waiver. i said fine, but it needed to be quick. he stared at me with his mouth hanging open - clearly, he has never, ever before met anyone who was in a hurry, in his young 18 years on this planet. he led me super slowly over to his desk and said he would have to find the waiver that i needed to sign. i mentioned that, if they were serious about getting new members and new business, they probably should have stuff like waivers just handy, right there at the front desk. he stared at me with his mouth hanging open again. then, he asked for my name. i told him i had just given him my name when i had introduced myself, so it was nice to know he wasn't listening. he said he was trying ""to help"" me. i informed him that he was speaking to a potential member, potential new business staring him in the face right here, and this is how he and his sidekick were behaving? he just stared at me with his mouth hanging open again. he was probably stoned, now that i think about it. i stared back and finally said, ""wow, you guys really don't care about new business do you?"" the little skank standing at the front desk yelled at me on my way out the door, ""we don't want you here!"" i yelled back that she was an ""asshole"" and left the club. guess who won't be getting my business in the new year!!!! you should go ahead and close this club down, loser management!"
1-star,0,it really makes me sick when thesse old men walk around the men's room naked with no towel. it's really a shame. they stand on the weight scale butt naked... they use the men's urinals butt naked.... it's really gross. have some class and wear a damn towel.
2-star,0,"once upon a time the q sports club was the hottest and hippest gym experience in scottsdale. you could leave your kids in daycare while you used the new nautilus machines, took a step aerobics class, or went for a swim. when you were done you could shower and change in the large locker rooms or if you were a real baller, you could purchase entry to the separate vip locker rooms. unfortunately, more than 20 years and two names later this la fitness still feels like you are going back in time to the 1990's. even the color scheme feels dated and although they have replaced a few pieces of equipment, you could go through a time warp wearing your zubaz shorts, a headband and an original pair of nike cross trainers and you wouldn't feel all that out of place. the first floor is basically deserted. there are one or two people at the front desk and i don't know that i've ever seen any one in the pool. unlike when 24 hour fitness ran this facility, they don't even have a shop with supplements or equipment for sale. the space that once upon a time held a massage / chiropractor clinic is long empty and the child care are looks huge for the small number of families that use it. oh, and the vip locker rooms still exist, but i've never seen anyone in them. upstairs is still a mix of treadmills, ellipticals, nautilus and hammer strength machines. there's a small free weight area and 24 hour fitness put in a jungle-gym type machine to try and compete with crossfit gyms, but it rarely gets used. there is also a large and small group exercise rooms where they offer group classes such as bodypump, yoga, and spin. a smaller room that used to be the spin studio is now mostly used by personal trainers. for some reason the center of the floor still contains a square counter that must have originally been used by gym staff, but is now mostly just a place for women to store their purses. it seems clear that the owners don't know what to do with this location. it would probably be cheaper to tear it down and start over, but until then it seems that no one wants to put any money into it and thus it continues its decline. luckily, if you're an la fitness member you have plenty of other nearby options, but if you're coming here, don't expect much."
1-star,0,"i've been a member at this gym for a little over a year. they swore up and down they'd renovate it within six months of me beginning my membership. not only has it not been renovated, they're no longer a 24 hour gym as of the 15th. worst of all, they disclosed how much i pay per month to a family member. if you enjoy outdated, broken equipment, invasions of privacy, and sudden changes in hours without any advance notice, this is the gym for you."
1-star,0,"buddy was offered no initiation fee by clay as he walked in for his trial. he said to stop by after his workout. buddy stopped by and a guy named chris first said clay had left for the day, and later went on to say he had actually quit (convenient). long story short chris said he overheard the conversation between clay and my friend and never heard anything about waiving the initiation fee. we walked out, no point in wasting time with unethical people. this gym used to be ""smart gym"" so there is no basketball court and it is older and smaller. it's funny because they send me emails once a month asking me to come back and join for no initiation fee, yet they try to tell you they have no way to do it. #triggeredsnowflake"
5-star,1,"this is my favorite la fitness location. the people are nice and always have a smile. i got my first personal training assessment with raine and she was fabulous. so knowledgeable!!!! she knew exactly what exercises i needed to do to assist me in my fitness goals. i'm training for a triathlon, and i know how to swim, run, bike...but i don't have a clue on weights and strength training. she knew exactly what i need to do for not only building the right muscles for tri-sport, but for injury prevention. i've been down this road before, and had to stop due to injury. her personal training skills are valuable for increasing my productivity as well as staying in the sport--essential for achieving my goals. also, i signed up with la fitness through chris, the gm. he was kind, knowledgeable and no pressure. i have a great aversion to salespeople. at no point did i feel ""sold."" i felt assisted in the process of acquiring what i wanted at a fair price."
1-star,0,"this gym is a dump. much of the equipment is old (very old) and shopworn. i've been told for years that this location would be remodeled or updated. peeling paint, stained walls and flooring. it's dusty and looks dirty. go to the la fitness website and you'll see that this location is such an eyesore that they won't post photos of the actual building. there are other la fitness locations around town that are fine; this ain't one of them."
5-star,1,"this gym is great. very clean, not overcrowded and all the equipment you would need. i had my first personal training session with raine. she is super knowledgeable and will teach you a lot about your body and how to meet your fitness goals. she came up with a unique plan for me and pushed me past my limits which is what everybody needs in a trainer. if you're looking for a gym and a great personal trainer make sure to see raine at la fitness."
1-star,0,"my wife and i were working out at this location, when she had to take a phone call. she stepped into a isolated area of the gym and took the call. while she was on the phone one of the trainers (named freddy) came into the same area with a client. he looked at my wife and told her to get off her phone. as if that was not unprofessional enough, he proceed to yell ""maybe if you did not talk on the phone you would not be so heavy."" first, my wife is not heavy. second, regardless it was extremely unprofessional and publicly embarrassing. frankly completely unacceptable. when we complained to the font desk, the attendant had a laissez faire attitude."
1-star,0,"if i could give zero stars, i would. i've been an la fitness member for 20 years and this is by far the worse location i've been to (thunderbird/scottsdale rd). it's never clean, weights are never put away, it's rarely open on time, and kids club is constantly closed! time to move on to a gym that actually cares about their clientele."
1-star,0,this gym can never open on time. if you require an early workout look elsewhere. most la fitness gyms have problems opening on time but this one is especially bad. besides that the equipment at this gym is antiquated and you frequently have to hold your breath using the bathroom.
3-star,0,"this place is definitely outdated and you get what you pay for. bargain equipment. it's maintained well enough for safety, but don't expect shiny new equipment. watch out for the hard sell on the training. overall good for your value if you just have realistically low expectations going in."
1-star,0,"this place is very poorly maintained, has bad industrial hygiene, and in desperate need of an update. this place has an excellent opportunity to contract an antibiotic resistant staff infection. management could care less about customer complaints, concerns or commentary. take your money to an institution that cares about customer retention and is sanitary. the equipment hasn't changed since this place was called the ""q"" back in the early 90's. the cable cross-over's have been broken for 4 months. still, no replacement or repair has been made. what a toilet!"
1-star,0,"i've been going to this la fitness since they purchased my membership from 24hour fitness. the turnover is incredible. i go about 3 times per week and see new faces weekly. the worst thing about this gym however is the kids club. the girl who does weekday afternoons and weekend mornings is extremely rude and unprofessional. she never greets me, never smiles, and if i try to make conversation with her she snaps at me. it's so bad that it affects my workout after being treated that way by her whenever i take my son with me."
1-star,0,"i went in there once to ask about a gym membership and now they call me ever other day. asked several times for them to stop calling. they say they removed it, but i keep getting phone calls. david the front desk clerk said he never called even though i have a voicemail from him 5 mins prior. no manager ever available. just a heads up on how they do business."
1-star,0,"la fitness acquired this location from 24 hour fitness which unfortunately no longer exists in the valley. la fitness quickly turned this location from a 3-star gym to a 1-star gym. the men's locker room is filthy and rarely cleaned anymore. the spa, sauna, and/or pool are frequently closed for repairs. deadlifting is no longer allowed here. the equipment is old and outdated. sometimes the staff is friendly, most of the time they ignore you. memberships are more expensive than when 24 hour fitness ran it. time to find a new gym!"
1-star,0,"was told in march that this la fitness was being totally updated. they said ""the owners are picky and have high standards and they were coming to visit after the 24 hr acquisition"". this is the worst, dirtiest gym i've ever used, we have been going to the shea gym instead which is very nice. i would skip on this location and wouldn't be surprised if they were closing it after a lease expires. keeping my fingers crossed they up one of their high quality centers in north scottsdale."
2-star,0,this gym hasn't changed since the mid-2000s when i used to go. signed up again and literally not one new piece of cardio. i talked to the manager and asked if they would be updating now that they're la fitness and he didn't know. the first day i went it was raining and there were buckets all over the place! tacky! cardio equipment is old and gross. stained (big stains) all over the carpet. i feel gross every time i leave here--and not because of my workout.
5-star,1,"i recently joined la fitness and had a great personal training session with joshua werner. josh is very professional, educated, and motivating. josh is developing a very thorough workout to fit my physical and health needs. i highly recommend josh for your personal your personal health and fitness needs."
5-star,1,"i joined la fitness on wednesday, and had a free personal training session with josh on friday. it was the best personal training session i've ever had! josh was totally great about going over my personal lifestyle, diet, and exercise routines. i left feeling motivated and on the road to a healthier lifestyle! can't say enough good things about josh and la fitness!"
1-star,0,"thinking of going to la fitness? be ye not so foolish! they talked me into personal training with weekly weigh-ins, a personalized meal plan, shopping excursions to whole foods - the whole nine. i was pretty stoked. until, of course my trainer no-showed for a solid month. then the second trainer quit after one session. then the third trainer quit. before i knew it, my pre-paid sessions had expired before i'd even been able to use them. i texted the josh the vp, who was supposed to be ""my guy"" after the month of no-shows and my text sat unread and unanswered for 5 days. not much of a guy. but really, not calling you back is kind of just the la fitness way. everyone i've talked to is like, ""gosh, that's not the experience we want"" but they sure aren't doing anything to fix it. with no refund in sight and no services delivered, i'm out $700. that's what i call getting swindled by business."
4-star,1,i like this gym b/c there are less people here so it's easier to get the machines you want. downside to the gym is the equipment is a bit used.
5-star,1,as far as personal trainers go....thank you veronica s. for always inspiring me & kicking my butt into shape! one of my favorite personal trainers i've ever worked with!
1-star,0,"this place is filthy. it's a former 24 hour fitness that i realize needs an updating however, la fitness doesn't even clean this place. the mens locker room is disgusting. you advise the front desk of this and they just say oh ok and continue on chatting with each other."
4-star,1,"this one is much better than the one on shea. much bigger workout floor, bigger team rooms, sauna, steam room, pool, hot tub. the only thing it's missing is a basketball court."
1-star,0,"awful!!! i go to the one mccormick or mcdowell usually but because the pool was inoperable wanted to see if theirs was working. i call, two rings and immediately get a man not in the best of moods ""la fitness, please hold"" like its a call center. ok maybe they are busy. so i wait, and wait and wait, minutes go by. so i decided to call again. i hear two rings and then he places me on hold again, no greeting this time. i wait a min, nothing... i call back, he's now angry... ""you're going to have to hold!!!"" i didn't say a word and he goes directly to placing me on hold. no hello, straight to hold and now he's pissed. great service la fitness, i had a simple question that could've taken you a simple ""yes"" or ""no"". i just wanted to know if the pool was open today... you've lost a long time customer..."
1-star,0,"i really enjoyed 24 hour fitness at this location. and then it was bought by la fitness. in just a month it has gone to hell in a hand basket. no more trainers, just sheets of paper to read at where you should be in your training cycle. outside grass is overgrown and not maintained. inside the showers have no soap. then there is the ""duh and oh"" staff. when you tell them anything, like the showers have no soap, they look at you with wide, dumb eyes and say ""oh"" and remain sitting on their butts, making no effort to fix the situation. there is no full time equipment maintenance guy anymore, just a maintenance groups that roves to the different locations, whenever they get there. i fear it will become a place with constantly broken down equipment like the one on tatum. time to start looking elsewhere. i was proud to walk in to 24 hour fitness. this place is really starting to feel like a dump. how sad."
1-star,0,"my son has an la fitness membership in ca. he came here yesterday with his buddy to work out as we are in town for a baseball tournament. they charged us 5$ for an ""inter club exchange fee"" and tried to charge our guest 15$ to work out. we already pay 29.95 per month and for that amount should be able to go anywhere we want. we had to speak to the gm to get a guest pass after getting strong armed by a sales person for our guest to work out. way to lose a customer laf! not a good look for the franchise. will be canceling ca membership as soon as we return home."
4-star,1,"great gym! we've been going there for almost a year now and we love this place! they open at convenient hours, there are a lot of tools to train, weight and cardio machines, a great swimming pool, raquette ball and basketball courts! the staff is very friendly and helpful and they do a great job at keeping the place clean and enjoyable to train at."
2-star,0,"my only qualm is their dam app. i've been trying for 3 hours to reserve a cycle for cycle class and their site never works. when i can't reserve a bike, i can't go to the class. their web people or i.t. people need to fix simple little problems like that to make everyone else's lives a lot easier. frustrating"
1-star,0,"probably the worst managed national chain gym i've ever been a member of. staff is rude and has constant turn over. trainers have no clue what they are talking about. thought an l4 vertebrae meant ""left side"". gym experience: trainers leave equipment dirty and sweaty soaked with their clients for the next person, great example they set. free weights are never put back or 1 of them is missing. always trying to upsell you as you walk out."
1-star,0,"i can't speak regarding all the employees, but i do want to recommend you don't sign up with sam. if you sit down with one of the sales guys named sam, ask for someone else!!! he will go back on his word multiple times and change prices. integrity is more important to me than anything, and la fitness lost my business this evening due to sam! i don't even know how he can even be the manager..."
2-star,0,"the hours are very inflexible. especially considering my prime workout times are nights and weekends (hello???? they open at 8 and close at 8 saturdays and sundays, they close at 10 pm weekdays). and about the front desk....there's this woman (girl) and she is a horrible person. she stares me down when i come in and obviously doesn't want to be there or 'work' as we call it. she makes my morning terrible with one look of her eyes. she constantly rolls her eyes at all the customers. there are no good workout classes here (hello bodypump!) there's also a ton of creepy old men. i'm canceling my membership. why am i paying 40 per month for this crap??"
1-star,0,"location is very convenient, biggest problem that makes it uncomfortable is the girl that works mornings on the weekends. honestly the most unpleasant employee, she is always on her phone, never even looks at the people walking in, she only brings up the scanner to sign in while string at her phone. she doesn't acknowledge she is at work and that she is literally getting paid to use her cell phone. i don't like it because it makes me and others as well feel like she would rather us not even get near her and it makes it uncomfortable to check in. the gentleman that works evening mon-friday is a great example of customer service always says his ""hellos, goodbyes and thank yous""."
1-star,0,"i have been to 7 la fitness locations in the valley. most are 'okay' making 3 stars. none 5 star. this location ... doesn't even reach mediocre. i wasn't even actually in the gym yet and the front staff was extremely rude. i can't believe that i was treated with such disrespect when all i asked was ""where is the sign in scanner?"" it amazes me that the employees are so rude and very arrogant. la fitness is not an inexpensive membership. you would think that the employees would be happy that they had customers. no customers ... guess what ... no job fools!!!!! i will not return to this location. my search continues. probably with another company."
1-star,0,"the front desk staff was incredibly rude! just went in to get an açai bowl from their berry divine place, but front desk lady chased me down and told me i'm not allowed in there without 'checking in' which i was told differently last time i was in! i said oh sorry i was just going to get an açai bowl and she said ""well obviously they're closed today so you can't get one anyway"" i will never return to this location! completely dissatisfied"
2-star,0,"this location is one of the nicer ones. it has two storys with plenty of gym equipment and awsome bathrooms and locker rooms to accommodate your every need. but one thing this location lacks is customer service everytime i walk in every employee has their phone out and will wait to finish a phone call before they check you in. they never say hi or by or acknowledge any type of kindness you still give them.. and one more thing i can not believe happens here is, 5 minutes before they close the weight room lights turn off.. god forbid someone is lifting weights and gets the lights turned off on them.. this company is asking to be sued. reguardless of the nice layout and abundant amount of gym equipment i won't ever recommend or return to this gym.."
1-star,0,i was very disappointed in la fitness. wasn't clean or a friendly environment. i felt pressured when i signed up. would not recommend
1-star,0,"#lafitness sucks. read on to see why! summary: la fitness has the integrity of a meth dealer. before i moved to thailand i contacted la fitness about refunding my prepaid membership because they have a policy where if you move out of the area and there are no la fitnesses they refund your pre paid membership fees. i've worked out at la fitnesses in mesa, gilbert, queen creek and the east valley. i went in person to the one on greenfield and that's where la fitness intentionally makes it difficult because you have to deal with corporate. first, they do not make it easy because you have to jump through all kinds of hoops to show corporate a new country id, utility bills, etc and these things are not always easy to obtain especially when you move out of the country.two months after i moved i had all the paperwork and sent la fitness everything needed via certified mail and over a month later they have done nothing refusing to honor the refund. here's what i think of #lafitness. 1) they have the integrity of a meth dealer. 2) they make it very difficult to qualify for a refund. let's see, a one way ticket to thailand... no gyms in thailand... what's the issue. 3) when you do qualify and jump through all the hoops which include certified mail and an act of god they still refuse to honor their own policy. la fitness has nice gyms. however, a company, #lafitness with no integrity that lies and refuses to honor their own contracts should be held accountable. i encourage anyone that's had a bad experience with #lafitness to share their experience and give them a review on yelp and through social media. if i had known la fitness had zero integrity i would have gladly taken my money and business to a company/gym that did."
1-star,0,"no matter how many times i ask, they refuse to get more 45lb plates. if anyone is working their legs it is nearly impossible to find enough free weights to do my workout. how hard could it be to get 30 more plays? they also run out of paper towels all the time."
1-star,0,"entering this gym was a big mistake! after talking to a salesperson for about five minutes i was so ticked off i will never return. the salesman was pushy, rude and arrogant. if they want to have clients buy memberships and stay at the gym long term they're going to have to change their ways and start treating people with respect. based on their ratings and reputation i'm obviously not the only one that feels this way. i live 5 minutes from the gym and will never go back, i'll sign up at the gym a little further just to avoid this place, not worth my money to be treated rudely."
1-star,0,"pros cool pool and ian, the trainer, was really nice. now cons. jacuzzi was gross, stuff floating around in it every single time i went. my main issue: i'm enlisted in the us navy. i needed to get in to shape before i left for basic training so i signed up to get a personal trainer. first of all, i was told that circuit training would not work for what i was trying to achieve, but what does my trainer do? circuit training. not only did it not work, but it made me gain fat as opposed to lose any or even keeping me where i was. i found out my ship date was going to be in the middle of january so i went in the day after the $210 was taken from my account, for my january payment, to cancel my membership. when i signed up, the manager told me that all i needed to do what bring in a copy of my orders and they would cancel it. well, because i didn't ship out until the middle of that month, i just lost the $210. while part of my was expecting it, i then got told that i needed to scan in a copy of my orders as well as mail in the copy. i find out, over a week later, that it still has not been cancelled and that i need to send in another copy of my orders. these people will tell you whatever they want to get you to give them money. they are awful and i will never ever go to another la fitness again. what's worse, there is no corporate number to call to speak to someone above the managers of the location. so i can't just call corporate to talk to someone about my membership fee or make sure that it has been cancelled. the entire company is just the absolute worst."
1-star,0,"if you plan on using day care for children, stay away from this gym! i was informed when signing up that they are required to have 1 adult for every 7 kids, but instead of hiring people specific for daycare, they simply take front desk people and throw them in there if needed, but they're not too good at math because coverage is still poor. beyond that, the adults in the daycare do not monitor or attend to the children, and we had three incidents in the course of two weeks where our four-year-old twins were bullied and harassed by older children but the staff told us ""we couldn't get over there in time to stop them."" furthermore, they were unapologetic and their lack of concern was apparent. if you have kids that need daycare while you exercise, look elsewhere, as there are more suited gyms within walking distance of this one."
4-star,1,it has one of the coolest pool in the city. be mindful it can get crowded and it will be closed whenever there is a water aerobic class but that is ok. the sauna is very hot so it works out great.
4-star,1,"pretty solid crew, solid gym! only thing is i understand they like to keep the gym clean, but it seems like every machine i'm on is constantly getting cleaned hard to get a solid workout in with someone in your shoulder the whole time. other than that, awesome."
1-star,0,"typical gym. overpriced and under cleaned. there are a few reasons i give it one star. they get pissed if you work out with anyone because there is no ""personal training"" (i guess talking to my brother every once in a while at the gym is personal training)........unless of course you buy it from them. the sauna only worked about half the time. the music was freaking horrible and so damn loud. ""regulars"" (i don't know what else to call them i went enough to be called a regular i guess) would hang by the front desk and try to flirt with the late night receptionist. it was super annoying when i was trying to check in and by the look on her face most nights i'm sure it was even more annoying to her. now the policies i paid cash in advance for a year so i wouldn't have to give them cc info but even that was a joke. i asked about a partial refund because some things in my life had changed (mostly having a daughter) and i wasn't going to the gym that much anymore. it wasn't a huge deal just something i was wondering about. i was told there are only 2 ways to get a partial refund. 1. proof of death (i swear i'm not lying) 2. proof you have moved to a place that doesn't have a la fitness within 100 miles. yea ok....well whatever. it's a gym so they are always going to try and get every dime they can. but my problem was mostly with the gym and the employees."
1-star,0,this is the worst la fitness gym i've been to. at least 40% of the cardio machines are either broken or due for major maintenance service! i would stay away from this gym.
2-star,0,"i was a member here for 2 years. i canceled my membership about a year ago. it was overpriced and i would be mid run and a ""personal trainer"" would approach me to talk about his sales pitch. i really dislike stopping my run to tell them i am not interested. it got to the point that when they asked me how my fitness goals are gonig i would tell them i have lost 100 lbs so far! that shut them up real quick. since i canceled my membership i have recieved weekly ""we want you back!"" emails that offer me a special deal of a monthly price that is more than what i was paying when i canceled my membership. i have called their local and corporate offices to get myself removed from this mailing list, to no avail. overall the facilities were nice. i was just highly disappointed in the service."
1-star,0,hayden hidalgo...stop leaving your crap flyers in unwanted sections of stores. your gym sucks and you make it almost impossible for someone to cancel their membership.
2-star,0,"phone call: hey, do you guys have a steam room? ""please hold, let me check...yep we have one!"" fail, no they dont. but they do have a sauna...yet, arizona weather is a sauna...never understood why fitness clubs put sauna's in when its free outside. hours are not the most convenient, but arent so bad. i never get the gallery of ""managers and reps"" sitting over in the office areas, what a cost maximizer for the corporation. geez, i wonder what my monthly fee would be if they had 1 mgr/sales rep per shift, which really is all thats needed. kids club is nice, but what they want to charge you is not worth it. those that give this place 5 stars have most likely never been to a gym before ever and have no clue what to expect. bottom line, they can do better, they just choose not to."
3-star,0,"when i started coming to this location a couple years back i was so excited, it was never super packed like the scottsdale location and it was really clean with fairly new equipment, i always felt comfortable there. it's slowly but surely going downhill. they haven't updated anything in this place in forever. the cardio machines are often broken. i'm a spinner and this location is still using bikes from like 6 years ago. it's impossible to find one that's in full working order. it's like musical bikes for the first 15 min of class. i will say i love the instructors for their group fitness classes here. most all of them are awesome. if they would just update some of the equipment this place would be 5 stars in my book again."
4-star,1,this la fitness is just like all other locations. cardio kickboxing class with andrea is awesome!!! i don't like how packed it gets during the 5-7 hour. and they hold the body fat percentage calculator hostage and make you sign up for training for it.
5-star,1,"i go to two locations regularly and this location always has the friendliest people working, looks clean, and has a great variety of classes. it doesn't seem as closed in or dark as some of the other locations. no complaints :) the women at the front desk on the evenings i go always seems to be wiping down the doors, windows, desk etc. which when you consider all the sweating on the machines it is nice to at least have the illusion that everything is being cleaned all the time!"
3-star,0,"my first venture to la fitness outside my chicago gym: same open, bright space and positive atmosphere, more diverse range of people (nice to see people with disabilities, including the man with seeping elephantiasis). strange arrangement of the ellipticals on a floating elevated strip with not that great a view. staff a little impersonal or icy, one i flagged down their attention to ask about towels, they directed me to the juice stand lady that was selling them. guess i should have brought my own......"
4-star,1,"i really love going to this la fitness on greenfield. of the few la fitness gyms that i've been in the area it seems to be the most open, bright, and clean. it's great to have the gym divided into the different areas. treadmills, elliptical, bikes, and stair climbers upstairs, circuit training in the ""big"" area, free weights towards the back. just trying to give you a little visual. i feel comfortable at the gym. i'm not some massive weightlifter by any means (although my picture may deceive you... haha) but i feel like there's a really good mix of people there to make anyone feel comfortable. i've just had some issues with the administrative side of the gym. my roommate was getting charged for a while since it didn't switch over to my card when i signed up with him and i've just never felt like the staff was friendly toward me... i know it's not always their job to say ""hi"" when i walk into the gym or as i'm leaving but when they have conversations with a lot of other people, or i almost always have to scan my card by myself just isn't the greatest. (these are really nit picky things by the way - just a few of my experiences.)"
4-star,1,"i'm a fan of this location. for the most part, the staff greet you when you walk in (the signal butte gym they didn't even look at you), it's pretty clean (i think), and it's close to home. they have a good variety of classes that give you a pretty good workout. my only complaint is that the director of the classes is always 15 min late to teach class which is super annoying. but, even though she is never on time, she will kick your butt. i take my son to the dayacare here, and the ladies that work there are all really nice. they remember my son's name and always gives him a sticker when we leave. they seem very attentive. the body works instructor (i think her name is jolene) is awesome!"
4-star,1,"i like going to this gym as opposed to the other la fitness's, because it's clean and everything is in working order. the staff are friendly and the personal trainers are approachable. i just wish the upstairs was bigger, so it could have more treadmills/ellipticals."
1-star,0,"one of the grossest gyms i have been a member of. the bathrooms are almost never clean, smell horrible whatever time you choose to come in to workout and the management even after multiple requests refuses to take action on it. i would rather sit on a porta potty for hours than even attempt to sit in their bathrooms for more than 30 seconds. equipment is a hit or miss, multiple machines are always out of commission. they did however add some new stair masters which are great. being swayed into it by other friend's recommendations, i tried out their personal training services while i was a member and boy was that a waste of money. trainers are more worried about making sure you finish before your 30 min are over rather than making sure they make the most out of it for you. even if they are late, they will make sure you finish before your time slot is over. even though they advertise 30 min sessions, realistically it is around 20 min. i was told while signing up for the service that i wasn't tied down to just one trainer, but when i complained about the unprofessional behavior of my trainer to the manager, no actions were taken. the trainer did get very defensive about it following which the workout sessions became progressively worse. would not recommend this service or this gym to people looking around."
4-star,1,"this is a well run gym at a great price point. they have a walking track, large free weight area, and 3 sets of circuit weights. the classes are better than average and included in your fee. this is a great gym for those not looking to spend a lot of time looking at themselves in the mirror."
1-star,0,"today this was probably the filthiest gym i have ever been in!!! busy gym during flu season with trash overflowing, not paper towels, no hand sanitizer and a staff that didn't seem to care. they said the janitor would be in tonight, in the mean time they wouldn't have to worry about trash overflowing any more because there are no more towels to put in the trash. i do believe if the department of health were to do an inspection they would shut the place down."
2-star,0,"you know! i would really like to give them a better review. however, after explaining to them 5. yes, 5 times our house burned down and we won't be using our membership. i was still charged for the passed 5 months. normally, it wouldn't be a problem. but, we live in chardon, that's a 45 minute drive to use this gym. i called over and over again. i even came in 3 times. yet, i was still being charged. today was my 4th time here and they said my membership was cancelled and i wouldn't be charged anymore. what about 5 months worth of charges. after i already cancelled? this is ridiculous! just another large corporation wanted to screw over their patrens."
1-star,0,"if you try to use a guest pass here, you will wait a long time an it may not be honored. not a good way to encourage people to sign up."
1-star,0,"it is a total disaster to enroll in this gym. please google it and consider my review before you go. i am not the only person who gets into trouble with unexpected bills from this gym. the staffs there have credibility issues. they promise you everything and treat you nice until you find out they are only after your money. i got billed for over $700 for personal trainings i have never agreed or received. after i brought this to the personal training director's attention and request to stop the unauthorized charges, i still get billed! so i have to call my bank to file a credit dispute. i don't know whether i will get my money back but you should not be the next victim."
2-star,0,"at first site, this gym was great, and even until now i really want to love this gym. the positives: great layout, use of space, design and features. there is an indoor upper floor track (which is impressive), plenty of cardio areas and the gym is large enough that even during peak hours it isn't as annoying as other gyms where you just lose momentum waiting for machines to open up. i do get a little frustrated sometimes and wish they expanded the weight training area for peak hours, but comparative to other la fitness centers this space is glorious. also, it's easy to find a less busy, more optimal time to go. it's impressive that they are able to fit in something for everyone there. i love me my stationary bicycling, and their little room is quiet, dimly lit and nicely isolated for when i want to just go at it without being bothered or cramped. there is a nice variety of weight machine, and plenty of rooms to do cool downs and cardio routines. the cardio machines upstairs are nicely updated. there are many negatives to this gym. first and foremost, they do not keep it clean. i can speak for the the men's locker room. i know it should expectingly carry that traditional stinky man scent you can't escape from, but the stalls and sink area are down right offensive. i've worked in plenty of restaurants and facilities enough to know that they do not even bother to use bleach, or they're not cleaning it frequently and extensively enough. it's so sickening i try to run right in and right out to wash my hands. it literally smells like urine and bacteria dried all over the floor and walls. i'm not exaggerating when i say it smells like that every time (and i go 4-5 times/week). it's like they don't even care. completely unsanitary. on the subject of cleanliness, there is a guy in the evening that tends to take his shirt off at the last hour and pine over his own silly bod (what a corny, narcissistic era we live in). shirtless and sweaty, he moves from machine to machine in the weight room. interestingly, there is cleaning staff and front desk staff helping clean up, walking right past him and no one enforces the ""keep your blouses on"" etiquette that every gym in the world has. what a great way to help transmit ring worms and mersa to everyone. there are a couple staff members at the front desk who have great customer service and are very polite, but most of the time we are standing there waiting on the other apathetic staff members to grab our passes and scan them while they sit there and chat to each other. one staff member was even sitting there calling stores looking for a beer pong table! not a good look for any business. i've counted up to 30 seconds as we watched two people chat it up before scanning us in. when my fiancée signed up, the man helping us told us he'd sign her up for a discounted price, but when she came in to sign up, he claimed that he overlooked it and that was for a different period. yeah we're not stupid- the bait and switch is not something new for la fitness. i've had a couple experiences both here and at home in wa, with la fitness ""sales"" reps. each and every time they are frustrating and just trying to sales pitch you to maximize profit for the gym. the other downside is that the basketball court can bring in very loud and obnoxious people. i've never had a problem until i got here trying to keep focus during my workout. the noise and yelling is so loud from the court, that even with my music at max volume, it's still hard to focus and get in my own zone. i thought i was being ridiculous in reacting but then i realized when i looked around, that everyone was irked by the noise as they tried to continue on. again, the staff hears the same loud noise- yet no one cares enough in that facility to do anything for the masses. this doesn't happen all the time and really just matters when you go- that's the plus side of that. this gym (locker room) is very stinky and has terrible, apathetic etiquette. we only stay because it's size, layout and i'm only here for another year for school. after that, thank goodness! it's unfortunate because like i said, i really want to like this gym. imo it has serious potential to bring in a lot more members. if the folks that ran this place just cared about improving, rather than just hooking ppl into contracts and knowing they have their money, and looked beyond that i think they would have a gym that retained their customers and their business. i would think twice and weigh the pros and cons of this and other gyms before signing up. i'm mostly the type of person who just gets in and out and so i try to bite my tongue when it comes to the negatives. but overall, i've seen other la fitness centers run with a better etiquette."
1-star,0,"poor customer service! was not able to get the promised guest pass due to the lack of proper information. i was told, you can bring the guest anytime for two weeks. however, what i was not told about is that the guest's phone number has to be placed in system on day of signing the gym contract. even after explaining my situation, they would not try to help me in any way. again, poor customer service."
1-star,0,"terrible organization and service. i signed up less than a week ago - at the time i was told that there is no option to do a 7-day trial of the gym as advertised, unless i sign up for a membership. however, as long as i cancel within 7 days, i will not be charged. i return in 4 days to cancel my account, because the facility is just too far for me to use. i was told that i won't be refunded because i had to cancel before 3 days. i was also told that in order for me to cancel, i need to come in when the manager is here, which is during normal work hours, despite an associate telling me over the phone that anytime would work. who can take a day off work just to cancel a membership!? when i told the front desk person that this means i may have to contact my credit card company to dispute the charge because of their service, she shrugged and said that that's what i would have to do. what kind of service and attitude is that!? they also consistently looked away and stopped paying attention to my questions even when i'm kid sentence. i would not recommend this location to anyone if you expected to be treated with common courtesy and respect."
2-star,0,too crowded all the time i hate it.. the staff overall is very snobby and unapproachable as well... don't like this location very much
4-star,1,great gym if you go during off-peak hours. waits are long for machines and free weights in the evenings. locker room and facilities as a whole are pretty good and membership price is very reasonable.
1-star,0,"been a member for at least ten years was there this morning &observed a very dirty walk/running track. the walls & floor were filthy. also, looked like a lot of bikes & other fitness machines were missing."
4-star,1,"i've been a member of the gym for a few months now. i really enjoy it. its not perfect, but thats why i gave it 4 stars. it is usually clean (not always extremely clean, which is why i gave it 4/5 stars...sometimes i see bottles or paper towels on machines left behind by other members), it does get busy at peak hours but i avoid those. i go in the mornings and its not busy and you can always find a empty machine to use. my favorite part of this gym is the womens workout room which allows me to be more comfortable, although a few times men have walked in while giving tours which i think is inappropriate (please let the woman tour the locker room/womens fitness room alone so no males enter it!) i also attend the group fitness classes 3-5 times a week and love them. they have helped me so much and all the instructors are great. i really recommend them! definitely check them out, its one of the better gyms in the area!"
2-star,0,"the past 2 months, i've been getting collections calls from different locations in the u.s. i paid $60 for a 5 day pass. the front desk girl said i'm late $32 and i told her i'm not a member and never was. she said that i paid for my first and last months when i ""joined"" in may (i visited my family and my cousin paid the $60 for me for the 5 days). she passed the phone to a sales rep, matt, i believe. ( i'm an assistant manager at a national health club. i knew exactly what was going on with the temporary account.) matt addressed the situation and agreed with what was going on and said he will call me monday to update me that the account will be closed. he has great customer service. as for the manager that signed me up.. he is bald and has glasses....he is a sleazy salesman."
3-star,0,"hey i like this one! they have a track overhead. the place is laid out very well. the staff at the front was not exactly welcoming, but not really rude. the place was really clean in the bathroom, but the machines were looking rough. there was some cups and debris left behind on the floor, so it looks like they are not vacuuming on a regular bases. but hey, it does not impact me while i am working."
3-star,0,this a nice facility that is not well maintained. the location is very convenient. i usually do my grocery shopping in this same plaza. my workout requirements are basic. i use ellipticals and weights mainly. the classes here are what make my membership worth it. i've enjoyed yoga and zumba but have friends who speak highly of spinning and kickboxing also. i pay 30$ a month and feel the cost and amenities are fair. there's also an indoor pool and track.
1-star,0,"i did my research on yelp before i went and took a tour. and everything that was written on yelp was 100% accurate....the facility is not well-maintained. fingerprints all over the glass windows like they hadn't been wiped down in months. when the guy giving me a tour offered me the option to check out the women's locker room i took it upon myself to get some live testimonials and ask a few ladies in there what they thought of the gym. slick, eh? one of them mentioned that the water fountain had been broken and it took the staff a few weeks to fix it. weeks? three ladies all gave me an, ""it's ok for the price"" response. they pointed out a locker that was hanging off the hinges, broken, and some unfinished areas in the locker room. they said stuff like that goes unaddressed for long periods of time. there were a few machines that weren't in working order. what *really* stood out to me was the fact that there were weights, mats, empty water bottles etc. laying all around the gym. so that tells me two things...the people that go to this gym don't re-rack anything (which is bad enough because it's discourteous to other gym-goers), and that the staff doesn't do anything which is worse. this is a big place and it could be so much better if they took care of it. it felt like a really run down and tired bally's fitness (even though i know it used to be urban active), and i didn't feel good when i was inside the place. i left there and drove down the road, took a tour of lifetime fitness, and bought a membership there. that place is the rolls royce of gyms in the area. so for the $35 per month la fitness quoted me it was a no-brainer to go to lifetime and pay the $75 per month to go there just to be in a cleaner, newer gym where you feel good in the environment."
1-star,0,"on dec 29th, a friend and i went into to the brand new cuyahoga falls location to see if we could take a look around/get a tour. we were thoroughly disrespected. we asked for a tour and the staff at the front desk staff called over some in a shirt and pants that looked like he might be management. he started asking us marketing questions, (what are you looking for, where do you work out now) and although i politely asked about 3 different ways if we could just take a look around at what they offered he would not give us one and told us to wait there (there were only a handful of members in the gym and there were though no less than 8 staff at the desk and at the marketing tables on the left talking to each other). they just sat there and stared and ignored us until we left. we finally did leave when a younger hotter person came in and asked the guy at the desk and he took her that instant for a tour without so much as a look towards us. even though i know first hand how shady gyms are, i'm still sort of in shock. it was clear to us the type of members they are looking to attract."
2-star,0,"have been working out here for a couple of years, and as far as gyms go it's pretty standard. i like the indoor track and the fact that they have child care available (although the caliber of that care is somewhat suspect). i usually go during the day so it's not too crowded, but can be pretty busy at peak times. locker room could be cleaner. membership fees are always negotiable, and if you pay upfront you can often get a pretty fair rate."
4-star,1,"star 1: friendly staff, and always well staffed. several pts available also. star 2: great open layout, with many options for traditional and 'modern' exercises, with a decent pool. star 3: cardio theater, in addition to an indoor track and a plethora of cardio machines on the first and second floor star 4: even at peak hours, you can still get your workouts finished without being flustered other pluses: good juice bar, saunas, several class options, plenty of parking minor nays: closes at 7pm on the weekend, and at 11pm on weekdays."
4-star,1,"love this location, have never had an issue here. the smoothies are good and the facility is never to crowded. i have had memberships at other gyms but ended up back at la fitness."
1-star,0,"despite my contempt for this corporation and management, my trainers rock. those two in particular, have changed my life. i will be forever grateful and give them five stars of solid gold. ethan and joe are awesome!!!"
2-star,0,this gym has changed a lot since it first opened as urban active. it was much cleaner and better ran than. la fitness has allowed the standards to deteriorate and the cleanliness to go by the wayside. it's frustrating when there's no direction from the staff towards patrons abusing equipment or hogging machines. additionally if something does break it can take up to 2 weeks for it to get fixed. yes this is a big gym with lots to do but it's not worth $35 a month.
3-star,0,"great location, i tend to go this location more since its more spacious then the market street location. reason for three stars is due to limits on free weights here. other then it's great ."
3-star,0,"to start off, let me say that i've been to at least 30 la fitness locations around the country. this one ranks somewhere in the middle. the upside is, it's not very busy, so you can relatively easily get to the equipment you want. however, the equipment is very mixed. some is new, while other machines are ancient. the older ones tend to break a lot, so a substantial portion of this gym is always out of service."
3-star,0,"oh, how i really want to love this gym. the location is great (next to a nordstrom rack? yes please.) the facility looks nice and offers lots of different kinds of weight and cardio equipment. they also just opened a smoothie/health food bar, but i've never tried it. but it's still missing the mark in so many ways. this place lacks in communication, customer service, and cleanliness. first of all, the time of day you come here makes all the difference. expect it to be a bit of a madhouse on the weekends (especially in the late morning-early afternoon hours). i have yet to take a class here because i find them to be at awkward times and the ones i've seen have been unbelievably packed. but i just figure they are so packed because they are that good. as far as the gym itself, everyone's comments about machines being broken and not fixed for a long time is totally true. machines will be unusable for weeks, but it hasn't been an issue for me personally yet, because there is an abundance of equipment and you rarely have to wait for anything, anyways, which is really nice. furthermore, i have to say, this is the filthiest gym i have ever been to. i always wipe down machines before and after i use them, because as you will witness, few people do. while i usually see someone cleaning during the week in the mornings, the weekends are a different story. hand sanitizer has often run out, trash cans are overflowing, bathrooms are gross, discarded water bottles are on the floor. as far as the staff goes, most of them are super nice. there are a few kids, however, that are usually sitting down, texting, and not even responding when you say hello as they scan your key card. maybe i'm old school, but seriously, am i inconveniencing you? and one final note - this place needs an email list or facebook page. i've driven here a few times only to find they have randomly closed with no warning. 2014, people!"
1-star,0,"i was mistaken when i even thought to give this place 2 stars. you can find decent equipment, a track, classes, etc at many other gyms. i def got another call from personal training... seriously??? not sure what education these guys have to be personal trainers, but they must not go over reading or understanding english. not sure how many more ways i can say ""please don't call me. i'm not interested""."
1-star,0,"the worst experience i had! signed up for membership and visit couple of times and was schedule an orientation, instead of showing me around, the guy was pounding me for 45 min. with the fact that i have to use his services as a personal trainer. it was awful so i cancel my membership. never again."
4-star,1,"pretty good pricing (month to month) and good training services. try to catch them on a deal. shoutout to stephanie who trained me for half a year! she was great. i highly recommend her. they have a lot of good amenities - pool, women's only gym, fitness classes, spinning, etc. i also occasionally go here for yoga and zumba. my only issue is that for yoga, it's more ""pop"" yoga. the instructor does a great job with breathing and giving everyone space to go at their own pace, but she plays sometimes poppy music in the background, and occasionally will try to make funny comments, which makes it hard when you're trying to hold your body in a pose! it works for a lot of people, but i prefer a yoga class with more concentration."
3-star,0,this gym is decent but i was looking for a gym that offered classes (which they do) but they are usually filled to the max and the times being offered aren't that good. i also tried to go spinning on a weekend morning and the bike i got on was broke so i had to leave and i notice that a lot of the equipment there is broken. the gym is usually crowded and there is a lot of grunting/yelling in the free weights area which is very annoying (definitely a meat head kind of gym). the one good thing about the gym is the pricing and they allow you to do month to month (i signed up when it was urban) so not sure if this still holds to be true.
1-star,0,"they will force you into a 2 year contract and then trick you with the cancellation fees. i moved states and the lady that signed me up kay said if i moved states it was free but if i wanted to cancel the membership it would be $50. here i am a year later, i moved and want to cancel it but no they won't let me!!!! worst gym ever. worst customer service."
1-star,0,"i was a member here for a little under a year. the gym itself is nice & i don't have any complaints about that. the reason for the 1-star are the corporate policies and harsh contracts. in fairness they have good pricing, but to compensate they take advantage of you from various contractual standpoints, misleading sales tactics, and outright lies during cancellation. so let's talk about what led me to write this review. there is a $50 cancellation fee if you move more than 20 miles away from any lvac. this $50 fee is uncommon and the vast majority of people will have no idea it's there until they move and cancel their membership. this is because the sales staff doesn't tell you, and most people don't read the contract. i told my at-the-time gf i would only sign up if she was the guarantor of my contract since i may have moved and i didn't want to be stuck with the $50 cancellation fee. she agreed and was the buyer of the contract. fast forward about a year, i move, and go through the appropriate steps to cancel my membership, sending in the required docs and whatnot. they confirm with me my (former) gf is the one responsible for the fee and my membership has been cancelled. they continue calling me asking for the money and i request my phone number to be removed from their database since my membership has been cancelled and i am not legally responsible for anything. the lady agrees and says she'll delete my phone number. fast forward a few weeks and i start receiving phone calls again which i don't answer. i then receive a letter stating my membership is not cancelled and i owe $43. i called today and the lady on the phone tried to tell me i was legally responsible for the $43. fortunately, having an attorney as a father i understood the appropriate questions to ask to get her to ultimately admit i am not legally responsible for this money & my credit will not be impacted; however, the representative was convincing, and most people would have been duped into thinking they were legally responsible and would have coughed up the $43 membership fee plus the $50 cancellation fee. you can really learn a lot about a company by reading their contract. the salespeople will tell you (or not tell you) anything to get you to join, and that's their job, i used to be in sales. you can only trust the contract... you also learn a lot about a company when you try to cancel your membership. unfortunately, both signing up and cancelling have been quite arduous experiences. couple random notes: -downgrades at ""end"" of contract have $35 fee & sometimes you won't be eligible for cheapest rates (they do this to try and force you to stay w/ higher tier pkg). make sure to clarify renewal fees and rates before you sign. -receive 3 months free for referrals, but they force you to go to headquarters to redeem (tactic to dissuade people from redeeming as there is no reason this can't be done from from any gym location). plus, they outright lied. they gave the person who referred me this 3month slip but when ""i"" read the fine print it did not apply for my type of membership. after bringing this up they acknowledged she would have gone to corporate and been rejected the 3 free months, and i would have signed the contract under false information. me reading the fine print and realizing i was lied to led to me choosing a different membership structure. -no 12 month option? forces clients into long-term (26mo) contract. also, no month-to-month at the end of your contract. forces long-term contract renewal. these are tried and true business tactics to take advantage of customers who don't understand what they're doing. -be careful. i received 3 different sets of pricing (2 of which were incorrect) from the sales staff. you really need to read the fine print and ask lots of questions. it's a lot more complex of a structure and contract than eos or 24hr fitness. -compared to 24hr fitness & eos, the staff is by far the lowest quality. that's not to say everyone is bad, i had a few people i really liked, but in aggregate, the lowest quality between the three. notably my issue w/ mj & my gf had an issue w/ 2 female employees taking mirror pics when she was naked in the changing room. this issue continued even after she altered management."
4-star,1,been with them for almost a year now so this is overdue! parking is plenty but it gets fill-up quickly. the facility is super clean. i like to use their sauna after a long day at work.
1-star,0,"very mean when i made my plan three years ago, i was told that i could cancel when i wanted to. but they lied, they gave me no option to do that. they said i could not cancel. after much insisting they said they would cancel, so, without worrying, i went back to my country, brazil. this year i went back to vegas, i went to the gym again, this time i was able to make a three-month contract. i paid in cash $ 100. i was super happy. but to my surprise the other day when i came back to work, my plan had been canceled. i was told that i had a debt for non-cancellation of the contract. i did not get back the $ 100 i paid the day before. i am very disappointed with the gym. i do not recommend ! you will never be able to get rid of it. and when you think you got them, they'll get your money making you a fool."
1-star,0,"i got a membership here, and i cant cancel it because of the contract i signed which i have to pay for years before i can cancel for free. they told me i have to pay $500+ if i want to cancel the membership. lesson learned, don't sign contracts from people you don't know, they'll lie whats not and what's on the contract."
5-star,1,"this is such a long over-due review! i love lvac and have been going here for years. my first location (pre-baby) i went to was the central/sandhill and although old, still got the job done extremely friendly staff, & clean. now that i've moved near henderson, i go to the green valley location and don't think i'm switching gym anytime soon! i must must must rave about the playroom now that i have a daughter. norah has been going to the playroom since she was 8 months old (now 2!) and they are nothing less than amazing. they remember her by name and she gets so excited once we pull up to the gym (forgive me for not knowing staff names - i should ask!) i usually going around 6pm and the same staff is there. now that it's the new year every gym is bound to be crowded so don't let other reviews fool you. love the staff. love the gym. period."
1-star,0,"i've been looking for a gym close to my house, as i didn't want to drive all the way to my office where my current gym is located. i signed up for a free 1-day pass to check this place out as many people i know go to lvac, and they seemed to enjoy it. the front desk girl looked like she was ready for work, but i felt like i was interacting with someone who didn't entirely comprehend what i was asking. she mumbled most of the time, and kind of trailed off, leaving me sort of confused as to whether i should repeat what i said or just get someone else who had a brain. the guy who was helping us fill out the form acted like ""sign up if you want, or don't -- just don't waste my time."" when i started to work out, some machines were broken and archaic. towels weren't readily available, and everyone in the gym must have been trained to stare at people with contemtment who didn't have mr. olympia-status muscle-bound physique or 34d-sized boobs. from the person cleaning the floors to the trainers all the way to the lackluster front desk girl, i wasnt feeling all that welcomed. then they hit me with a 26 month contract. when i said i don't want a contract that long, the staff just plainly stated, ""it's only 50 bucks to cancel though."" when i replied, ""it's still 50 bucks though,"" he didn't say anything, and he didn't say anything either when i told him, ""thank you, and have a good day."" i can deal with less-than-stellar equipment. i won't deal with rude staff. and i didn't meet a single one today who was decently nice. won't be going ever again."
4-star,1,no complaints i like the classes they offer... 8 strikes and rpm cycle are my favorites. just wish they offered more on the weekends.
5-star,1,i love my gym! i have been working out here since i moved to las vegas in 2007. going on 9 years soon. i have nothing but good experiences here. i shall be working out here for another 9! ;)
5-star,1,"finally!!! a manager who makes and runs lvac green valley like a five star resort like spa!!! this new manager is joey fisher and because of this guy, i am bringing all my industry friends and colleages with me since this gym is in way better shape thanks to joey. no more spit balls or nasty toilets or smells of sweat and funk or brown pools or spa. because of joey as manager, it's like working out in beverly hills at a five star resort. don't take my word for it. come and join the prestigious lvac and see for yourself. thanks lvac for looking out for us members and hiring this guy joey. vip of lvac - szw"
1-star,0,"this location has the worst costumer service ever!!! i've been coming here for 5 years and it's always been the same. front desk is extremely rude, they never greet you and they seem bothered whenever you ask them questions. -10 stars for them"
4-star,1,"its good big gym. has everything you need to work on your fitness. there is a pool and indoor track too. the only thing is parking sucks and at any given time of the day its always busy. this gym is always packed and at least once everyday i have to wait for a machine which i hate because im a person of routine. there's like over 100 classes too, so if thats your thing then this is the gym for you. there's also a small women's only gym downstairs that has most things you need."
1-star,0,"bought a three year membership. not a great gym but i i paid for three years. joined the vip locker section. after my 2 years of vip locker i had knee surgery during renewal time of locker. no call, no notice just put my my personal items in a plastic bag. the area manager bill apologized to me. i renewed my locker and got my stuff back. about three months late about $200 stolen from me out of my locked locker. two weeks later another $40. i'm fortunate enough it didn't hurt me but no fun. bill seemed to fix the problem by changing locks and access to vip. renewed my membership that expired and at that time switched from premium to standard. i have vip access i didn't need premium. on invoice told them to change membership to standard and authorized to cc to be charged each month. after 7 months of over billing called to get straight with them the told me you're switching memberships we have to charge you more and a sign up fee. are you joking? i cancelled my membership today effective june 30, 2015. don't go to this gym unless you want to be treated like trash, stolen from, and ripped off by them. i hope my post saves one person from the mystery of joining lvac."
1-star,0,i'm an avid gym enthusiast. i go.5-6 times a week. i got the pleasure of visiting this place with a member not too long ago who swore by this place. she loved this place. then she took me ....member services did not want to honor there own promos and made us both jump through hoops and was plain rude. which is fine. one star for rudeness g. if i could get over that if rate them a lot higher for the gym itself. large facility with a lot of equipment. i'm assuming to their low pricing (good thing) that explains how insanely busy it was during what i would consider a non peak hour being from another part of the country.
1-star,0,"i have attempted to cancel my membership over the last 5 months as i haven't set foot in lvac. i noticed a $20 charge in addition to my monthly membership. when i called lvac, they stated that this was an insufficient funds charge. i reviewed my bank account and called to confirm this was not true. i had plenty of funds and payment was processed at the initial request. lvac did not call me to say i didn't have funds, but expected customer service out of the biggest scam gym in town was expected. i plan on using this to cancel the membership before the two year expiration. the fine print at this place is as fungal as the nasty overcrowded locker room! don't go here!"
1-star,0,"this is the worst gym ever, their customer service sucks!! they try to lock you in for 2 years, they lie, and they're management at corporate is very unprofessional do not sign up here ever. tru fusion is right down the street and they are absolutely amazing"
4-star,1,one of the two lvac's i go to and this one is the better of the two. it's location can be a problem at times as traffic is backed up certain times during the day. this gym is usually crowded so parking can be equally as fun as fighting traffic. the equipment is up to date and they always get the newer machine to exercise on.they have two classrooms that offer many different classes for your pleasure or pain! the pool and hot tub is a decent size and usually has enough room. the sauna and steam room also a larger than other locations and these are popular spots on members visits. the club is clean and staff is friendly.
1-star,0,"steer clear... signed contract 2+ years ago and still getting charged once expired 9 months ago! no refund, and no apology of any kind! apparently you sign up for life! go month to month or don't go! there are better clubs in town! no stars if that was an option!"
1-star,0,"i was very disappointed today, i brought my wife along for a tour the facility and possibly her becoming a member. the sales representative gave her the tour was really lack and didn't give her the full details of the facility. it seemed like we were bothering him for the tour, it seemed like a real good opportunity to sign my wife up today turned out to be dismal as she is did not sign up thank you for your poor representation by your sales staff. i would like to suggest that your manager aj is retrained on how his customer service skills are delivered to your current and future customers."
1-star,0,"not happy with this this gym or the customer service at all!!! found out two months after processed payments, that even though the payments went thru on my credit card, they were considered late. now i owe $50.... where were the phone calls or emails (some sort of communication) the first time a payment was ""late"" i think they do shady things like this on purpose to get even more money. like i told them, if i had known there was a problem, i would have taken care off it two months ago!!! it's a $20 membership, not worth this! plenty of other gyms with out the run around and non communication."
1-star,0,"bottom line: oversold and unmaintained. this is the 4 gym i have been a member of (i move a lot). it is by far the worst. all of the problems stem from the same cause. they never stop selling memberships. i have been this gym at 10 pm on a saturday and its full. i have regularly driven around for so long lot looking for parking that i gave up and went home. you regularly have to wait for machines. many classes are so full you can barely move around. i have gone for spin class and had to leave because there wasn't room for another bike. despite the high demand for classes they haven't added any more. it is a high use gym and it doesn't seem like it is ever cleaned. the entire place reeks. i assume that their staff are underpaid because they are all rude a-holes. basically, it seems like the owners of lvac are trying to squeeze every penny they can out of their gyms."
4-star,1,"one of my favorite places to be. except during zumba of course! i started recently coming back here to work out and get back into shape. for the most part they have avoided me about the free months i was suppose to get with signing my friends up, but whatever thats a thing i hate about this place. i did though get a year for $144 so its not too bad. i've checked out most of the gyms around my area and out of all of them, this one just simply has me most to offer me, seeing as i like running on a track and not a treadmill."
1-star,0,"giving it 1 star only because the staff left a bad taste in my mouth. i don't remember the guys name that i dealt with, but he was over pressuring me to sign up & was not professional. plus its always over crowded, so for me its worth driving 15 min to edge fitness off blue diamond. their staff is extremely friendly, & i train 3 times a week for the past 3 months & have never had a problem. this location is only 4 minutes from my home, so if the staff treated me & my girl friend more professionally, than i would've signed up since my brother & friends work out here too."
4-star,1,"this is my new location, since i moved. i much prefer the location on rainbow & vegas dr. i haven't been to any classes yet here. but i will be trying soon. the womens only area could use some work... they have a good amount of cardio machines. and seems to always be busy. lots of parking, but always busy so might not always find a spot too easy. i will be updating this after the next time i go and see more of the location."
4-star,1,"can those tv ads and that website be any more annoying? they market to add sufferers. awful techno music on the tv just blares up when it plays (virtually useless - non informative tv ad) and their website has those annoying ""live interactive"" salespeople that tries to talk to you and you can't find any relevant info on your own. good luck finding the monthly fees on the website. i gave up. not worth the hassle. edit- good deal on membership once i showed up. i feel like an ass now since i wrote bad review. this place is pretty good compared to the local 24 hour.. cheap too."
2-star,0,"i was a member here for six months. it's a decent club but there are entirely too many people. at 5 pm, i expect a gym to be packed. but 5 am? parking is terrible here. the staff is pretty indifferent when there's an issue and i'd rather pay more for a gym at which i can actually use the equipment sans a 15-minute wait."
4-star,1,"great gym at a great price. open 24 hours a day every day. lots of classes all day every day. can get pretty busy. nice indoor running track and the kids area is fun for the kids. alot of people complain about the people who go but honestly, if you are going to work out, who cares what other people are there."
3-star,0,"it seems funny giving a so so review to a business i go to 6 days a week. this is one of those situations where you make lemonade out of lemons. i got a great deal for pre-paying for a 3 year membership. it is close to home and my workout partner was already a long time member. don't get me wrong, the place isn't awful. it is just very heavily used. machines are starting to show their age a little and they are not super fast on updating them. first 3 months of the year are the worst because all the ""resolution fatties"" hog up valuable gym space. my only other huge peeve is their cleaning crew is scheduled for 9am every day. really? prime time is when you have to mop at a 24hr gym? how about 3am? that would make more sense. until this city get s a nice high end option like sportsclub la or reebok club, it will have to do."
2-star,0,"i originally liked the idea of a large athletic club, until i started having to deal with the management of this chain. here are a couple of examples: 1. they gave me a membership number that was the duplicate of someone else's number. after i called and cleared up the matter with their corporate office (nobody at the gym itself is empowered to do anything) i attempted to go back to the gym. when i arrived they wouldn't let me in. i calmly explained that i had just talked to corporate and my bills had been paid on time, every time directly from my bank acct. 1 hour later (and 45 minutes more on my cell phone, since they wouldn't let me use a house line) we finally got the matter cleared up. unfortunately i could no longer workout since they had wasted all of my allotted time. all of this, and not a single apology or offer of compensation 2. they decided to close their child care at 2 pm three days after a holiday without advertising or announcing that they would be doing this. when i arrived to drop off my kids they just said ""tough luck, what do you want me to do about it?"". other: as expected the personal trainers have completed their mail-in certification program, but are hard pressed to figure out that folks workout for many different reasons. their expertise is sorely lacking and the free session was completely unproductive. the one spin class i attended started off with a 35 minute ""endurance ride"" (i.e. ride the bike at a normal pace) then we stood up for 5 minutes and concluded with a cool down. not exactly the ""spin class"" i was looking forward to attending. on the bright side, i've rarely had trouble finding equipment to use and there have been very few instances of broken equipment that isn't fixed quickly. the location is convenient and their 24 hour schedule is helpful for busy folks. the gym has a lot of potential but the staff and management seems to not be focused on their customer base."
1-star,0,"good luck trying to cancel your membership. i fax over information and strangely enough they didn't receive anything. and even when they do get your inform, if you moved out of state they will charge you for a couple months anyway. and if you get a new debit card and have a long distance number they will not call you to inform you that you bill is building up. all a sudden your 2 states away and collections is calling you for $700 dollars. thanks lvac for not spending 4 cents on a long distance phone to inform me of anything!"
5-star,1,"rob is the best trainer in las vegas! i look forward to working out now. each workout is customized and tailored to my current fitness or strength level. even if i sustain minor injuries while playing sports, my workouts are modified to not only work through those injuries but to allow them to heal without losing fitness or strength in the process. i cannot imagine having anyone else as my personal trainer. try him out. you will not be disappointed."
5-star,1,"i've been going here for years and love this place. rob takes his time to understand your fitness goals and helps you achieve results. i've been to numerous gyms that do group fitness and never felt like i received any attention or had someone to be able to show me alternate moves if i couldn't do something... not here. the focus is to ensure you don't get injured which is key if you want to have sustaining results. wether you try the body pump class, personal training or group training... you should try it."
5-star,1,"lvsp has been the only gym i'll work out at for almost four years! i started coming to this gym after a few years of not being very active. my back hurt and my hips made a popping noise when i did certain exercises and rob fixed all of that! lvsp isn't your average gym, it's really about changing your lifestyle. my workouts are 100% tailored to what shape i'm in and how my body functions and i always see results when i put the work in! i got into the best shape of my life before my wedding with rob and currently am working on regaining strength and physique after my first baby! i wouldn't go anywhere else, i love this place!"
5-star,1,robbie martinez has given me back my mobility. four years ago when i started with him i hobbled in with a cane. i've had 11 surgeries and will be 70 in december and my improvement makes me grateful everyday. i have a individualized program that rob constantly tweaks to challenge me weekly. he had me quickly off my cane and i am still advancing. in spite of the different ages and levels of fitness even some world class athletes he gives me 100% devotion. check him out it works!!
5-star,1,rob is the best. i haven't been here for long and already see more improvement in my body and it's ability than i've seen doing anything else. definitely try it out! if you don't have excuses not to work out that is.
5-star,1,"i first came to lvsp for a bike fitting after hurting my achilles tendon on a ride, i wished i had come here first instead of trying 2 other locations to get a proper fit. a couple of years later i am still riding with the position greg set me up with and with no problems/pain. last summer i started to come here for the group training classes. i have been to a few other gyms with personal trainers and they don't even come close to what greg and rob have to offer. they start you out with a functional mobility test to determine your strengths and weaknesses and create a plan designed specifically for you. the group training is pretty much a semi private session with either greg or rob, class sizes max out at 6. during the class they are constantly watching everyone to make sure they are using proper form and determining if your routine needs changes. unlike other trainers i have had in the past who try to push you too hard right out the gate, greg and rob slowly work your weight up to avoid injury. i also did classes in the cycling studio. it is a nice setup and between the group workouts and cycling studio i was able to ride further more comfortably, which to me was more important that going faster, although i was getting a little faster. if i still lived in las vegas i would be going to lvsp, i have yet to find a gym that can come close to what they offered. instead i talked to greg one afternoon about what weight kettlebells i was using and exercises so i could continue what i was doing there at home. not quite the same, but better than some of the places i have seen around my new area. if you are looking for a great place to work out and get in shape in las vegas, this is the place to go. their facility is spotless and the equipment is in top shape."
1-star,0,"i'm very hesitant to offer such a dismal rating, as i'm more inclined in life to find something praiseworthy. in light of the poor rating, i feel it's incumbent upon myself to thoroughly explain to the reader and, perhaps, even the trainer, why i have come to this conclusion. my daughter has been racing xc mountain biking for the last year. i'm an avid mountain biker, but hardly knowledgeable about racing, training and the detailed philosophy and mechanics of the sport. through a search on google, i was delighted to find greg and his facility. i read some articles he'd written, heard him interviewed on a podcast and thought the facility on the website looked outstanding. i couldn't wait to get my daughter started. we sat down with greg and i was convinced i hit a home run. greg, aside from being a certified 'bike fitter', is a former racer (both mtn and road), and clearly understands the sport and the art of mountain biking. he gave us a lesson on the physics, biomechanics, psychology and theory of racing. i couldn't have been more thrilled. we talked about the advantages of having a local trainer, as i had previously dabbled with an online service. so far, so good. greg set up my daughter's training program which consisted entirely of different types of riding on the trails. this all made a lot of sense and i loved the focus and direction it gave us. however, a pattern was starting to develop. the first thing i noticed was that beautiful facility we saw was never utilized. when i enquired as to why, i was told that during her race season, it was not a good idea to start any kind of weight training. this made sense and so i thought when the season was up, maybe we'd be spending some time there. i would be patient and listen to the expert. another expectation i had, was that he would actually get on the trail with my daughter and work with her. well, the first attempt at that and i was told the day of the ride that his bike was out of order and we'd have to re-schedule. fine. the second attempt to ride was canceled due to the heat. i found that unpersuasive, as riding in the heat in vegas is commonplace. when we finally did manage to get together, he was very instructive, knowledgeable and the experience made me very happy. so, you can see, i don't for a second question greg's knowledge. something else started to develop. the lines of communication became very difficult. greg made it clear he wanted to use email. however, it seemed he only meant one way. meaning, when i would email him, i'd get no response. additionally, it seemed reasonable to me that i could attempt to get him at his facility. so, i would periodically call there when email didn't suffice. he was often with a customer, of course, which, i completely understand. i think that leaving a message for him to contact me was well within normal business/client relationship practices. my daughter would have a race every other week. it would seem reasonable that we could expect him to reach out to discuss strategy etc. except for one occasion, this did not occur. you start to get the feeling that we were just not that important. today, oct. 27th i called, with excitement, to tell greg about my daughter's results in sunday's race (as still... no email). i got the receptionist who said ""greg was available"", only to come back to the phone and say he was busy. so, i simply left a message for him to call. i had done that a few times the previous month, only to be disappointed in not getting reply. i attempted one more time today, the 27th and again was told by the receptionist ""he is available"". now... here is where some weirdness begins, and i may have been the cause. i responded to her... ""are you sure he's 'available' or do you mean you're going to check?"". she came back and said he was not in the facility. and here's the closer... i get a call from greg saying he speaks ""flat out' and wants to end the service. he assured my that my child has a great future, but he will not put up with me being 'rude' to his staff. he also scolded me about how he communicates through email. but, here's the kicker... and this is what bothers me the most, is unforgivable and the reason i'm writing this critique. he said ""i've asked around town about you and see that this is a pattern"". ooh. that was fighting words and completely below the belt. because, that is meant to be painful. it's unknowable or provable to me. it's not relevant and not believable. but, it was meant to sting. didn't he know i'm a new yorker. i'm not gonna put up with that. anyway, i was taken by surprise. i literally didn't see that coming and, admittedly, i'm a little pissed right now and might decide to take this down eventually if i remember. the guy has knowledge, i'm just not sure he's 'all there' and certainly doesn't believe in good communication or discussion. so.. there you have it. i wish him the best. i truly do. just a little pissed about that ""i've asked around...."" comment."
5-star,1,"what a great workout! this place may be geared towards athletes but the team could not have been friendlier or more helpful during our drop in to the body burn class on a saturday morning. if you are lucky enough to live in vegas and try this place, you'll be hooked. if you are just visiting like me, drop in and enjoy a customized workout at a very reasonable price (my class was just $20)."
5-star,1,"this gym has provided me with the best experience i've ever had in the world of fitness. the trainers are attentive and innovative. my fitness level is constantly being evaluated and the training program evolving with me as i do. the equipment is top notch and the environment is the opposite of the big box gym....nobody taking selfies in the mirror or oiling their body or looking like they're about to hit the club, everybody is there to work and get fit!"
2-star,0,"i've been coming to this gym for about 3-4 years now and i love it! i'm a loyal lifetime member that doesn't cause trouble and doesn't mind following the rules but recently there's been a new rule change about wearing your shoes in the sauna. i think that is utterly disgusting and unsanitary to make people take of their shoes when hundreds of sweaty people and feet walk in their! i think that rule should not be enforced and should be taken off immediately since there is a lady manager at night that is a nazi about it. i understand they're trying to keep it clean but for 1) we pay 60 dollars a month for them to work so they should be able to clean it. 2) if hundreds of people go in their a day and they don't clean it at night cause they think it's ""clean"" cause we have our shoes on i'm pretty sure disease and nasty stuff is going to start spreading. i hope someone reaches out and fixes this problem immediately, thank you ."
1-star,0,"watch your bank account!!!!! i just noticed i was charged $69 fee for a membership that was canceled in october (last payment was in nov). i just called and talked to olga, i explained that i was changed $69 today and my membership was canceled. i have not been charged since nov (last payment). she asked if i canceled or put it on hold. i told her i canceled completely, like forever! she asked if i came in to the gym to do it (yes i was told that was the only way) and she asked if i was given a cancellation form. i did but don't now 6 months later!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! she put me back on hold and came back and said that she sent an email to her managers nancy and patrick and that i would get refunded 3-5 days. this is sum shady sh*t. i wonder how many other people they do this to. i guess i need to cancel my freaking bank account so this company doesn't charge my card whenever they feel like it. i will update this post in 5 days (or less) if i see the $69 in my account."
4-star,1,i basically use this membership for the kids swim lessons. i truly wish i didn't have to pay for membership to enroll my kids in swimming but that's the deal. also wish there were more class time options. i've been very happy with the swim staff especially noah who has been awesome with my kiddos. we previously attended hubbard at the recommendation of friends however my kids learned 3x as much ian's did more in one month that they did in 3 months of biweekly lessons at hubbard! so glad we found lifetime for lessons.
1-star,0,"life spa is the worst place to get a massage. i got one a few days ago and have been in pain ever since to where it hurts to breathe. first, they try to cheat me from my hour massage by doing ""neurokinetic"" therapy which i was not informed will be part of the massage. just stay away! it's expensive and causes pain!"
1-star,0,"this place is ridiculously overpriced, we paid for a member ship for 2 years and barely went. so i went in and cancelled my membership and now they have me in collections saying i never cancelled it, now 4 months later of me calling them every time a collections agent called me saying it was put on hold not cancelled they are saying the amount for the hold is less then the early cancellation so i should just pay it. wtf! that is not good business practice! they should have notified me at the time of cancellation any charges dues which they didn't, nor did i ever get any bills, just a collections agent calling me every month saying we owed, $10, then $20, then $30 now $40 and each time i reiterated that was had cancelled and not put on hold, they said it didn't matter and i owed them money now. i finally just paid the $40 and will never recommend this place to anyone."
1-star,0,i brought my son to swim today even though i'm not feeling very well i have high blood pressure but i wanted to get him out the house to swim for at least 30 minutes in the indoor pool as my son is swimming in the shallow water i'm approached by lifeguard telling me that i need to be in the pool with my son in the shallow waters then his manager comes out she tells me the same thing so i move closer to the pool so that i can be close to my son they asked us to get out of the pool because i refuse to get in the water today because i'm not feeling well mind you we have been coming here for the last 2 to 4 months i've never gotten in the pool with my son and now all of a sudden today it's a problem i will be canceling my membership i paid $122 a month not to be harassed by life time staff when they're having a bad day i would not recommend anyone that just want to come and relax with their children to lifetime in goodyear arizona i have referred several people and their families to this gym i will be making a complaint to the general manager tomorrow and i will be telling the families and friends that i've referred here the issues and let them decide if they would like to keep coming which i don't think they would it's not a family-friendly place they will harass you if you are of other color yes i said it lifetime is a races place
4-star,1,i've been a member since 2010 and i must say the last couple of years have been the best. overall i love my gym. the management and staff are very attentive to the members needs and request. there is an overwhelming amount of support for your wellness needs. love the life spa and cafe. my only disappointment is the cardio equipments cleanliness late at night. after being used all day by the time i get there it's in need of some major sanitizing.
1-star,0,"do not join this gym do not sign a contract..... i have had a membership for 4 months. been paying 110 for me my girl and my son. today my girl took my son as she has in the past already and all of a sudden hes not registered and we have to pay an additional 13 dollars a month to have him have child care. the gym is good and ammenities are good but they lie and decieve to get you to sign up. ive left 2 messages for manangers and have recieved no call back. i hate being lied too.... 13 dollars in the grand scheme is nothing but i personally do not do business with dishonest businesses. i have a year contract and they got me for another 8 months after which i will absolutely be leaving this gym. very dissapointed in the way ive been treated and i do not reccomend you sign up here. you mean squat to them once they sign your contract. do month to month or better yet go to a different gym. once they got your bank info and your contract, your dead to them apparently."
5-star,1,this place gets five stars where ever i go. you get so much more than a gym membership when joining life time fitness. the place is always clean. ample space for any kind of workout you want to do. the extra programs and classes they offer are great as well. this is gym of all gyms. family friendly and positive atmosphere. you really get what you pay for.
1-star,0,"canceled after 7 days of trying it out. didn't notice they where still charging me after two months of canceling. i went to talk to the manager and they told me i was going to see a refund and my account will be closed. it has been a month and a half now and still no refund. to top it off i'm still getting emails stating that my account is pass due. i was expecting organization from a $60/month gym. keep this in mind just incase you want to ""try it out"""
4-star,1,"this is an amazing place. my kids love to come play in the pool during the summer. i work out 3 times a week and the equipment is always clean and in good repair. other than the hot tubs being closed too often, it is a great place to get fit. thestaff is friendly and helpful. only complaint is that it is a little pricey and they should allow you to brieng a guest a little more often."
1-star,0,"just another big, scummy fitness corporation that will keep billing your card long after you've canceled, and refuse to refund fraudulent charges. don't sign up unless you're ready to be a member until death, or until you're ready to file a fraud claim with visa, because that's what it'll take to get out of here."
5-star,1,even though this gym is more expensive i do like it and my kids enjoy it i do wish they had fitness program for the kids for free rather than paying another additional price. my youngest has a bit of difficulty but i think it's because he's used to a preschool setting where they sing and dance well here it feels more like a babysitting position. i have my oldest so he tends to give his brother the attention and it works out. i love the classes especially wednesday night zumba step and is my favorite and i just enrolled for the 60 day challenge and i'm excited to see how that goes.
1-star,0,"i signed up on the 6th of oct and was also signed up for the 60 day challenge. the trained told me then if i signed up with him he would train me for an hour each session and that he would credit my lt bucks toward my first personal training bill. he talked up this big game and said he could work around my work schedule. the first few sessions were alright and i was content. it wasn't until my 4th session that i realized i wasn't getting my full hour. when i asked him about it he said i was only paying for 30 minute sessions, completely disregarding his ""promise"" when we met. go figure. in order to work around his schedule i had to go to the gym at 830 pm, after working, leaving me no time to get anything done. i told him i needed to do earlier sessions and he said he was going to sign me up with someone new who could meet me earlier and that he would call or text me with info. nothing happened for 2 days so i called him again and he said that he was still going to train me and i'd just have to work with his hours. for he last 9 days i haven't received any messages or calls back from him so i called the gym after the 5th day to try and cancel my personal training contract and the trainer i talked to told me i had to talk to my specific trainer because he couldn't access my file. i called back the next day after i realized i had already been billed for the next month $328! he told me i would be billed monthly from the day i signed up which was the 6th. so not only did i only get 4 of 8 sessions for my first month but now i was already charged for the next month before i could cancel. the female trainer i talked to apparently could ""access"" my file and told me she would cancel my contract and email her manager and that her manager would contact me and refund my $328 and actually use my lt bucks toward my first month like my trainer said he was going to do in the first place. 3 days later, today, i get a call from another personal trainer seeming like he wanted to help and offered to refund me my lt bucks but could not refund my $328 because i didn't do a written statement to cancel. not only was i not aware that i needed to do this but i was told something completely different when i signed up. i tried to call and cancel in time and couldn't even talk to my personal trainer. when i talked to another one he couldn't help. and the next one... apparently i was too late. now i'm awaiting a call from the general manager which seems doubtful by now. i enjoy going to this gym but i feel really ripped off over the ""personal training aspect. the kicker is that the personal trainer i was training with got fired on saturday and i didn't even know this. i guess they didn't plan on notifying my girlfriend or her mother who also trained with him. they were just supposed to keep calling and texting and getting nothing back. i really hope someone calls me to fix this or i'll have to just cancel the gym all together and dispute the charges with my bank."
1-star,0,"i went for a tour and loved the facility, beautiful, huge and smelled great. however when i took my kid to childcare (he was in sandals) he was told he couldn't play in the maze because he didn't have socks, that's fine but they left it there... they didn't redirect him to other toys or the ipads. they let a 3 year old sit there staring at other kids playing for 45 mins being oh so sad. i'm also not sure the adult/children ratio is within legal standards. there was maybe 60 kids and 4-5 adults. childcare is most important to me, and i won't be signing up because of this incident."
2-star,0,"lifetime fitness is a solid place to lift, swim, run, etc. however, once you sign up its almost as if no one cares about you. i had tried to ""suspend"" my membership for the month of january as i was going to be gone. i emailed 3 different times to the employee who signed me up and not one response. i have no idea why i was never responded to. so then i called the place and talked to the manager who assured me things would be taken care of which they were not. called again and in my profile there was no written information on me calling before and no information on the emails i had sent. have full proof of emails and calls. its pretty pathetic customer service and all they care about is making money. the overall gym is great but the customer service is something to definitely question prior to signing up. be aware that is all."
5-star,1,"life time is the most impressive gym facility i've ever seen. there are more pieces of equipment, classes, rooms, classes, training, and other amenities than you'll probably ever use. and honestly, the price isn't bad either. (if you're a veteran or have certain bc/bs policies, they waive whatever the initial sign up fees are as well.) i rarely see any broken equipment, which is impressive given the sheer number of machines. the staff is helpful and isn't always trying to upsell you, which i appreciate. i primarily joined for the pool(s), so i could swim year-round, but i've found myself appreciating a lot of other things that life time offers."
1-star,0,the gym equipment is on point ... but when i took one of the classes the yoga mats smell ! i don't think they wash them.... the class was great though dont ever go to the juice/smoothie bar ... they are so slow .. like a bunch of big ass buffoons trying to figure how to make an almond spinach smoothie ... how long does that take 20 minutes + and there was noone before me !!!!!!!!!! all you have to do is throw almond milk and throw spinach and pour into a cup .. it takes less than a minute .. anyways i ended up canceling and got a refund but wasted 20 minutes waiting and i looked over the counter they just started blending it like wtf! totally incompetent the guy did even say sorry for the wait or anything he was just like oh yeah refund okay durrr stupid gorilla
4-star,1,very good gym. i am a big fan of group classes and have stayed a member because of these classes. i tend to stick to classes amy teaches since she is super motivating and fun!! also enjoy the hot yoga classes. what is keeping me from a 5-star rating 1) the membership prices are quite steep and 2) the classes tend to get really crowded and require you to get there 30 mins prior to get a decent spot. wish they would add additional classes to the schedule. especially evening classes. 3) there are a ton of kids which makes it hard to go to the pools.
1-star,0,$16 dollars for lunch. 20 minutes later no lunch. went to counter and wasn't even started yet. staff email eating together. wth.....
5-star,1,"ahhh lifetime fitness.. probably (my opinion) the best gym around. the gym is open 24/7 which helps me work around my schedule. the staff are really great and very friendly. i've been going consistently since 08 and lifetime is always trying to improve the experience for us! great gym, a little pricey compared to other gyms, but well worth the money (if you go consistently)."
1-star,0,weeks later and still barreling them on my membership. i called gm went to vm he never called me back called again and the same never called back. we i think there on gm 7 so what do you expect.
5-star,1,lifetime is as good as it gets! i love my gym! the staff is extremely friendly and the class instructors are great! i am a yoga fanatic and they offer multiple classes throughout the day which is really nice. i take yoga 5-6 times a week here and love it! the locker rooms are extremely clean; the entire club is very clean. i really enjoy working out here and refuse to work out anywhere else... i'm addicted!
1-star,0,"not a good experience here at all. do not use spa, no bathrooms, had to go to the family bathroom in my robe, inexperienced masseuse. signed up for a trainer session and it was nothing but a sales pitch. pool closed a lot, hair in showers and not clean. a complete joke, not a gym......more like a sleazy car dealership. i contacted management several times and no response!"
4-star,1,"i'm sorry for those that have had bad experiences at goodyear lifetime; however i can't say the same quite yet. so far all couldn't be better- exept for two things. eric who signed me up, did an awesome job in presenting in everything. the gym is always clean,super clean towels, always find an available clean working machine, never overcrowded, plenty of classes offered to just join for no separate fees. i initially met with a pt which didn't work out for me- so i chancged to meet with charles and annie, they both are awesome people to work with. not superficial at all, easy going, encouraging, no pressure sales. my two setbacks are that i wish there were better massage chairs at the spa place- those chairs that they currently have suck major, it's a joke of an annoyig massage. and i wish they would supervise the kids more and separate the little kids from the big kids, all that running around and comingling of big and little kids- is just asking for an injury. i doubt that i would drop off my little ones with them just for that reason. otherwise this is a great gym- if i could i would spend half my day there - it's an awesome place to join. it resembles a country club a top notch one."
5-star,1,"fees and inclusions: yes, this gym is kind of expensive- $52/month for a single membership, $100/ month for a couple. if you only want to run on a treadmill or lift weights, this might be overkill. for those who like classes and want some luxury options (eucalyptus steam room, anyone?), the price is very reasonable. membership includes access to any class (except for the ones that use the reformer pilates machines) from spinning to hot yoga to core. it includes access to both the indoor and outdoor pools, the saunas, and steam rooms. and an insanely huge cardio area and a very nice selection of weight machines and free weights. classes and instructors: if you enjoy classes, $52 is a steal. being a yoga fanatic, i feel like i am in heaven. there are 2-3 yoga classes every day, with hot yoga at least once a day. go price what it would cost to do yoga every day (or even 5 classes a week) at a local yoga studio. the way i see it, i am getting a steal on yoga classes and everything else is just a bonus. all of the instructors at lifetime are fantastic. speaking about yoga, specifically, these are the best yoga instructors i have ever had the joy of taking classes from in my life. the instructors in general are friendly, welcoming, and know what they are talking about. i've taken the gamut of classes and have interacted with over a dozen instructors, and have never had anything other than friendly, pleasant experiences. i've also never had to get a ticket to go to a class, so maybe that's just a zumba thing? someone mentioned randy, specifically. i have taken classes with him and never picked up on anything rude, arrogant, or ass-like. equipment: you won't wait in line here for a cardio machine, whether you are wanting a treadmill, elliptical, or stair machine. when i enrolled, my member service guy told me to come to his office if i ever had to wait in line and he would make sure that i was refunded for that month.a few weight machines have duplicates, but there is a chance you might have to wait if you are wanting a specific weight machine and are there at a busy time. i go several times each week, and any time a machine has ever been out of order, it is fixed within a couple days. personal training: when i signed up, there was a special for 3 free personal training sessions with your membership. unlike others who experienced a high-pressure sales pitch, i actually really enjoyed my first and second sessions. my first was used more to discuss my nutrition, current exercise regimen, and fitness goals. my ""trainer"" (dustin) asked if i was interested in having a personal trainer as a long-term thing, and i explained that i was very comfortable with my current routine and meeting my goals on my own, so i was really only doing this because it was free. he was okay with that and didn't try to change my mind, and used my second session to do more of a physical-therapy type session (which i loved) showing me how to properly stretch out the areas where i tend to feel soreness. i was switched to someone else for my third session, and this guy (don't remember his name) was flaky. he rescheduled me at the last minute 3 different times. i ended up not using this third session, and used my credits to do a couple of yoga workshops, instead. so, for personal training, it seems to really depend on who you get. in terms of the fitness/health assessment, this was free and checks things like cholesterol, body fat percentage, range of motion, etc. i was kind of skeptical of my results, because i am 5'6, 125-130 pounds (size 4), and have a fairly athletic body type, but was told that i should focus on losing weight because i had too much body fat. you don't need to be a toothpick to be healthy, so i was actually kind of offended by this. facilities: i have never seen the locker room messy. it is always clean, there are always lockers available, and the steam room with the eucalyptus is just luxurious. i love that there is a separate family locker room for parents with opposite-sex children... it prevents awkwardness. my only complaint is that you can't get a long-term locker in order to be able to keep a toiletry bag or other belongings at the facility. i have had memberships at gyms that cost less than 1/2 of this one that have had that option. so, overall, i think this place is well worth $52. i'm not sure where other people are from if they consider this an ""ungodly"" amount of money... it is pretty average for a gym membership everywhere that i have lived, and more than reasonable for this level of facility and amenities... a downright steal if you take advantage of the classes."
2-star,0,"2 stars mean "" meh. i've experienced better"", and that statement runs very true for this ""gym"" i signed up in may to get fit and to get strong. it was a pretty nice gym, lots of equipment and lots of room. the locker room is very nice and they have steam rooms and private showers. this place has a ton of amenities, but it is not a great gym it is a club, a place to go and great and meet and that's about all. if you are into heavy lifting, or into being able to get to the free weights at all this place is no good unless you go on friday night when there is no one in there. try getting in there on a monday, tuesday, wednesday and your not going to have enough room to stretch let alone work out. the people that go here are not friendly in fact they are all pretty much scared to make eye contact. everyone is to focused on the chick in the workout room or staring at themselves in the mirror. the company itself cares more about getting new clients than retaining old ones and the gym is just over crowded. it is a very pricey gym well over $100 for two people and that price goes up even higher with kids. i recently canceled my membership and moved to a real gym not a club. my only advise to this company is start caring about the clients you have more than you do about packing more into your facility."
5-star,1,"how i miss this place.....the pools, hot tubs, steam rooms. i'll be okay since i can pay whopping $20 less a month and go to a 50 year-old ymca in pennsylvania ;( arizona is so fortunate to have new, nice gyms!"
5-star,1,"pricey but worth it. i got a 7day pass to use and fell in love with this place. the locker room was always clean. unlimited towels to use, lockers (where you don't need to bring a lock because it uses your club card in exchange for a key), hair dryers, body wash in the showers, a sauna and the steam room with eucalyptus aroma therapy is something i miss terribly. ( i moved back home after school and was a member for 6 months) this place felt so pretentious when i first walked in- then i joined after my 7 days was up. best decision i made in my life. everyone was so friendly. i got two personal training sessions and matt did a great job. he wasn't pushy and didn't overly pressure me to buy anything...this led up to me buying more training sessions on my own accord. i lost 20lbs with his help. i would take my lady friends (even my mother in-law) here to hang out in a spa like environment. the club advisers who signed me up would get me free passes for my friends to use so we could ""get away"" and relax at a gym. this place was like a huge spa. i always felt energized after leaving this place. who goes to relax at the gym anyway? always thought it was sweat and tears until i came here. my husband got a couple hair cuts at the salon and i did a brazillian. i was given a cup of hot tea and they put a hot lavender scented sash thing that helped relax my shoulders before my wax session. the woman who did it was quick and very nice to keep me talking so i would be distracted from the pain. i also let her know it was my first time. i wish they would open up a club in my state! however when i visit i'll definitely be picking up a 7 day pass and if i move back to az....i will not hesitate to join again. they have successfully ruined my expectations of any gym out there- i simply cannot find a duplicate."
5-star,1,"i don't know how people complain about the prices when this is the premier ""chain"" gym in the entire state of arizona. you get what you pay for, especially with the facilities and cleanliness. cheaper gyms don't have towel service nor squeeky clean showers that lifetime has. i've been a member since they first came into arizona way back when. i lived in the east valley so i was a member at the gilbert location and sometimes frequented the chandler one, next to ikea. what's very interesting is that even though lifetime is a huge national chain, all their locations vary on layout and what they offer. also, they are open 24/7. this is one of the main reasons i'm a member here. i think they're one of the only ones open 24/7. i sometimes go to work out after midnight and i like having the option to do so. it's a trip when you go to a different lifetime, especially if the floor plan is the opposite of what you're used to! i know the tempe/chandler location has tanning beds, which i wish the goodyear location had. there are a lot of group classes available as well as very good child care. if you take advantage of all that they have to offer, it is not expensive. also, the sales people are to the point. they are not like bally or la fitness where they try to give you a ""deal"" by giving you a year or two worth of membership, so they can literally take all the money from you up front. i know so many people who have prepaid for their gym memberships and never go! lifetime is month by month so you can quit or place your account on hold. best ""large"" gym in arizona!"
4-star,1,"i was in the area and wanted a fitness class while here. this is a great facility - huge gym w/ plenty of cardio equipment, free weights & machines. it is spread out so you aren't on top of one another. they also had an indoor track, racquet ball courts & pool. i attend a body pump class which the instructor did a great job with. there is a beautiful outdoor trail that runs along the hospital and gym area as well. i would definitely return to it."
5-star,1,"this place is the best. as far as equipment goes, if you can't find it here, you probably don't need it. when any of the machines are out of order, they are not out of order for long. there is generally a sticker or some other kind of notice on the machine with the approximate expected repair date. not something you would find at your local city rec center. the locker rooms are exceptionally clean, and soap, shampoo, lotion, and towels are provided. there's also a sauna, steam room, and whirlpool in each locker room. there is also an olympic size swimming pool for those who prefer aquatic sports. classes are offered, and many of them are free of cost to members. some of the classes have a small nominal fee. even though they have family times in the pool area, the locker rooms are restricted to those 14 years of age or older. this means no whining, sniveling brats underfoot when you're trying to wind down after a long, hard workout. this alone is worth the price of membership. i would recommend lifeworks without hesitation."
4-star,1,just joined last week. i met with a complimentary trainer who suggested some machines to use and made sure i knew how to use them correctly. today i took a couple water classes and i enjoyed the instructors for each. everyone i have spoken to seems very nice and whenever i have a question a gym member seems more than willing to advise me. so...so far so good!
5-star,1,"we joined a couple of months ago, and love the place. it has a wide variety of machines, weights, cardio, strength, and a million classes of all types. clean as a whistle, and you don't feel like you have to be a musclehead to be there. there are also trainers available for fitness evaluations and instruction on the machines. all this, at a very affordable price."
4-star,1,"overall i like lifeworks. the child care area is outstanding...my kids love it, the locker rooms are kept clean and it's not overly expensive to join. for the most part they have all the classes an amenities you could ask for. my only complaint is that when equipment breaks it seems to take an inordinate amount of time to be repaired."
4-star,1,"as part of southwest general, lifeworks offers a bunch of programs and deals a lot with rehab and massage. i use lifeworks solely as a workout facility. and it's the facilities are what lures me in to lifeworks. and it's not super ridiculously expensive. i've joined or visited most all of the gyms in the area here, each having their individual perks. i personally love workout classes and lifeworks offers a wide variety for every level; land and water. the locker room is spacious with nice showers providing shampoo, conditioner and body wash. there is also a hot tub, steam room and sauna located right in the locker room. you'll definitely make some friends in there. with a new memberships, lifeworks gives your 6 free training sessions, as well as a few other paid for amenities such as a free pilates session and a hot water massage. still being a new member, but have generally been impressed with the services and facilities and am currently happy with my choice."
4-star,1,"it's awesome for this place to have an intro to pole class. the instructor was so friendly and welcoming, and the class wasn't that overwhelming because we were all beginners. they taught us quite a few tricks for a beginning class, and made us feel confident that we could do this. i also went to an aerial class and was able to do some inversions, as well as get some stretches in. the only problem with live it up is that it is quite costly. it costs around $25 dollars a class, and a membership isn't much cheaper."
5-star,1,friendly environment. great coach. looking forward to my class everyday. will recommend to anyone who is interested in pole fitness.
5-star,1,"this is a fantastic pole studio! the instructors are friendly, the classes are fun and everyone at the pole studio is extremely kind and encouraging. definitely recommend taking an intro class or 4 week beginner course to start off but eventually you'll get addicted and opt for a membership! my favourite part about this studio is that it's more like a small community. you'll get to know the instructors well and the students too. most classes can only have up to 11 students so you get the individual attention you need when it comes to perfecting or learning a new move. i'm not going to lie - pole is also really hard. and that sense of community is awesome when you're feeling down about not getting something right away. there were so many times in the beginning when i wanted to quit but i kept going because everyone was so encouraging and willing to provide tips and help. also lots of free parking! :)"
5-star,1,super awesome pole studio. the classes are super fun. all the instructors are really helpful and their routines are super amazing. it has a great community and everyone is really nice.
5-star,1,"i would definitely recommend this studio to anyone interest in pole or has done it for a while! maggie the owner was super patient when it came to memberships and being new to the studio! teachers here are also super supportive and go above and beyond to teach not only what the syllabus says for the day but what you think are your strengths and weaknesses. this is one of the few studios i've seen in the gta that not only just does the exotic part of pole! it is an all round workout! they work on every part of the body. during stretch and aerial yoga classes teachers ask students body parts they would like to work on! very personalized experiences here through every type of class. if you're looking for a great workout, dancing, stretching, flying in the air doing aerial yoga then this is the place to be!!"
5-star,1,"i always look forward to the pole classes here, and after class i'm thinking of when i'm going to be at the studio next. that's how much fun the classes are. not only are the instructors supportive and encouraging (shout-out to iris, who is wonderful), but the students also help each other out with tips and pointers, and cheer each other on. it's a great atmosphere to be taking classes in. the pole classes are also great workouts. i agree with a previous reviewer that in addition to learning dance moves, there's a focus on developing the strength to properly perform new pole maneuvers. i've also been to this studio for a pole party for a friend's birthday and jen made it so much fun! we learned a pole routine step by step and managed to do it all together as a group by the end. i highly recommend group parties here too."
5-star,1,i've been taking classes here for almost half a year. all of the instructors are super attentive and helpful. they are always willing to slow things down when you're having trouble. definitely recommend this studio!
5-star,1,"probably one of the only pole fitness studios that focuses on both athleticism and art in all of gta. i highly recommend both pole and aerial yoga to anyone who is looking to build upper body and core strength while having loads of fun. maggie, the owner and head instructor is amazing; so are all the other instructors."
5-star,1,i've been going to this studio for half a year and it's been a great experience. instructors are really nice and fun. would recommend it.
3-star,0,"i tried aerial yoga for the first time at this studio last week. the address is a bit hard to see from the road at night but there is plenty of free parking. it isn't really yoga in the traditional sense where you move smoothly from pose to pose, and if you can't do some of the moves there aren't really any alternatives. you do require some level of fitness to do this, arm strength and flexibility specifically. the instruction was attentive and ensured everyone's safety, but since people are at different levels it is pretty slow going. i didn't work up a sweat but i felt it in my core the next day. i was wearing shorts and was told capri length pants would be better; i was going based on the photos on the website, which show everyone wearing considerably less than that, and the only mention of clothing is that if you tend to sweat to wear something that covers your underarms. the front door opens right into the studio so it was pretty cool in the room which was something i didn't expect. i would probably go again if it was a little more affordable."
5-star,1,"i've been to several of the big pole studios around toronto and i have to say i've finally found a studio that feels like home for me! a lot of the other studios i've been to lack that one-on-one dedication that maggie at live it up provides to all of her students. she's very attentive and knows how to instruct based on my body and the level i'm at. it's great to be around an instructor who is a patient and works with you to make it to that next step in your pole practice. she's never too tired to demonstrate and teaches directly to you. i can tell that she's genuinely excited when her students progress and that supportive environment is why i keep coming back to this studio! another great thing about this studio is that you do not have to share a pole. i've been to studios where you're sharing a pole with a stranger in a 1 hour class which essentially means you're paying full price to spend 30 minutes on the pole. i've also found that maggie is concerned about the safety of her students. she is always there for a spot and will recommend methods to help you enhance your grip. she also makes sure that you have a proper warm up and cool down which i've found a lot of other places will skip over, resulting in soreness and injury. definitely would recommend this studio to all aspiring pole dancers no matter what level!"
5-star,1,"i purchased the groupon in july. it was $45 for 5 classes. maggie is the owner and instructor. she is very nice, patient and attentive. maggie is also very encouraging and allows you to play around with variations (with her instructions of course!). i have tried aerial yoga (a little slow for me but still fun), intro to pole (love this!!) & can't wait to try some more! the studio is very clean & spacious. i helped organize a bachelorette here and maggie was very accommodating. everyone had a great time and she also bought us mini cupcakes! the session was one hr (5 girls - most places dt require max of 8 ppl), $35 each, photo/video ops, and a chance to play around on the pole and aerial yoga hammock. i will highly recommend going to live it up for classes or even a party !!"
5-star,1,"great pole studio! i've been taking pole for a year at other studios but this one is by far the best. not only is it close to my home, you get free parking too! the instructor is great. she is patient and spends a lot of time working with me to achieve my goals. i'm constantly learning new things to the point where i feel like i don't have enough time to practice. it is a friendly and safe environment and is a great place to meet friends. i highly recommend coming here!"
5-star,1,"have been taken 7 classes, there have very patient and friendly instructors, very professional skill. she makes sure all students achieve something new before leaving the class . i have learned lot and that is the reason i keep coming back to the lesson . :) plus, the place is prefect, clean, large and free parking ."
5-star,1,if you are looking for personal training from a guy who knows what he is doing i highly recommend madden. this guy really knows his stuff when it comes to fitness. his gym has all the equipment you would find at a large place - minus the crowd. personal 1on1 training and on your schedule.
5-star,1,"i have been going to the madden endurance gym since early 2014 and in 3 months i lost 15 pounds. my wife had another personal trainer and she stalled out on her weight loss progress. at the time she stopped losing she was 20 pounds from her goal. she has been with tony for about 8 months are she is 5 pounds from her goal weight! tony is a caring, passionate trainer who wont let you give up on yourself. he wants you to better than what you were when you walked through those doors. unlike most classes, tony isn't in it for the money.... he actually loves what he does & it shows in his clients."
5-star,1,"love this place! no ridiculous crowds, or overfilled classes. personal training and classes in a private environment with great people!"
5-star,1,"i've been using his personal trainer services for almost 8 months. i couldn't have asked for a better training experience. there are many different exercises he bring into the session that keeps it exciting and fun. he provides excellent healthy eating tips whenever we go over the ""what did you eat today?"" part of my session. he encourages when i feel like i don't want to go another set and motivates me to do better. bootcamps are awesome! fun times with like minded people. awesome services with reasonable pricing!"
5-star,1,"i highly recommend coming this gym if you are looking for a total body workout. whether it's boxing, kickboxing, boot camp, or personal training, each workout is a full hour of excitement and intensity. tony's personal training techniques have helped strengthen my old injuries as well :)"
5-star,1,"first it's a close location to us, so we thought to give it a try and let me save you time and money.. not a huge place but you have all you need. great people to spend time with. very clean place and great customer service."
5-star,1,"my husband and i joined this gym specifically because of geographic location as it's near to our house. my expectations were low, but the price is affordable, lots of handweights, bathrooms are clean and stocked, the people are nice, the gym is relatively quiet (which i like) and i never feel like i have to compete for equipment. this is a great non-meathead gym, perfect for those who prefer not to talk to anyone. would love to see a few more machines (hip abduction), but overall very pleased! i'm grateful to have it so close by."
5-star,1,"if you have class pass this place is sure to please. their evening circuit training classes are essentially personal training sessions. you'll have lots of one on one attention as sweat and run and lift and sweat. park above or underground behind metro and they are on the second floor. you can take the stairs or elevator but you are heading there to work out. for those looking for a home gym, their monthly rate is very reasonable and includes these circuit training classes too. everyone as friendly and everything was clean. i left tired and ready to visit again."
5-star,1,"i was in the search for a new gym since the one i used to go to closed. i tried a few gyms before i came across metro. i tried their 3 day class pass but i didn't complete the 3 days because i knew this was the place i wanted to be at after the second day. their circuit training sessions are different everyday and they are intense. while the classes are going on, the gym is still open to other members who want to enjoy the equipment and do their own workouts. but what made me fall for metro is the instructors! regardless if there are 10 ppl or just 1during the classes, the instructors give you the quality training and proper form techniques. the other gyms i tried, didn't have the personal effect i have been so used to from my previous gym. metro gives that and so much more. the only thing i would like to see is having the circuit training classes at 5:30 rather than 6:30 and alternating those times between thier crossfit light and the circuit training. this way it gives individuals in either class a better schedule. if anyone is looking for a gym that offers personal attention, open during regular hours, great equipment, judgment free atmosphere and structured classes then metro is the spot"
5-star,1,"great place to come. the location is awesome, huge parking garage, and an elevator if needed after the crazy workouts. the staff is friendly and caring. they were extremely helpful in answering my questions and were very accommodating to work out modifiers, when i needed them. the prices are good and i will definitely be back!"
5-star,1,came here for a class last night. this gym has a convenient location with plenty of parking spaces in the back. staff is friendly from the front desk to the personal trainers. restrooms and showers are clean. large windows for a great workout view. my favorite machine is the rowing machine.
5-star,1,best gym in charlotte! kettlebell & trx lovers will find everything they need here. a large cross fit section as well. perfect location and great management team.
5-star,1,"metro fitness has changed my life. i hated working out for the longest time. i am proud to say that i have been consistently working out since last november doing crossfit. all the instructors are professional and so friendly, they are very patient as well. the staff is also awesome and make you feel like you belong. the center is so beautiful, well kept and clean.... a definite plus! they are worth every penny and are hands down thee best facility in charlotte (i belonged to a total of 6 gyms in the charlotte area before joining metro fitness!!) give them a chance, you will not regret it!!"
5-star,1,"i've worked out a lot of gyms and with a lot of personal trainers and metro is the best. it's clean, professional and they are serious about fitness. while everyone is pretty focused on their workouts don't be afraid to ask for help. the trainers and staff are extremely professional and spend time on the floor. they will gladly help you learn a new exercise or show you the proper form. i work out with thea routinely and can't say enough great things about her. she is a constant professional, stickler for good form and knows how to motivate me. she customizes my workouts and constantly coaches and me and pushes me to achieve more. i highly recommend metro fitness."
5-star,1,"best gym i have ever been a member. sure the sports club la at the four seasons in miami was trendy and chic with their ambient light and house music but metro has something that not many other gyms have, a real knowledge of what physical fitness actually means. the crossfit classes are insane and will redefine what you ever believed a workout was. the best part about this gym is the sense of family, everybody suffers together, we cheer each other on, and we reach levels of athleticism that we did not think were possible before. if you want your gym experience to be some meaningless chore somewhere else than have fun with that, if you want to beat all your friends at every sport imaginable then join metro"
5-star,1,"at age 39, i realized that i've let my couch-potato ways get the better of me over the last few years. i'm a big guy. 6'4, but i topped out at 384 lbs. in october i started dropping weight by adjusting my diet. 50 lbs into my weight loss i hit a plateau that had held for almost a month. a friend at work recommended metro fitness and their training approach. i signed up for a year, and a package of 30 personal training courses. i am 2 weeks in, and already i am starting to see a change. my weight hasn't really started to drop, but my body composition is already beginning to change. i feel better, have less pain in my legs and back, and am really excited about the change happening with my body. the staff are fantastic. my trainer is amazing. i got tired last week during a workout, and he brought me a 50 lb dumbbell to hold for a while. when he reminded me that this is what i had already lost, it really kicked the rest of my workout into high gear.he also taught me with exercises that i can do on the road, so while traveling this week i've managed to keep up the working out. i've tried dozens of gyms over the last 20 years, always promising myself to get back to my high school football player weight / physique. and every time has been a failure. but i think metro has the 'secret sauce' which is going to keep me comign back again and again each week until i reach my goal!"
4-star,1,"what a great facility in a convenient part of myers park. went herd for a yelp kicks butt class, and was very impressed with the staff and workout. a good mix of newbies and experienced folks for the crossfit class, and they made all of us feel comfortable with the workout. a few shakes were even handed out post workout. thanks for the workout dar & company. can't wait to return!"
4-star,1,"this was a yelp sponsored event that was both a crossfit and athletic conditioning class the gym offers. i am providing a review of the class and instructors rather than the overall gym experience. so if you are interested in either of these 2 classes then read on my friend! there were not many people in the class familiar with crossfit so the instructor described crossfit and it's main principles. he provided an overview of each movement before we started making sure our form was correct. we did a dynamic warm-up one of which was a weighted sled push. oh boy was i gonna feel this the next day! by now the long sleeves have come off and we were ready to start the ""workout of the day"". the workout was scaled in half since there were a lot of first timers present. being a regular cross fitter this was not an issue since the time was not cut in half so i could just do more. the workout consisted of a 250 meter row, 10 push presses, 10 box jumps and 5 burpee like movements. you are to perform as many sets as possible in 15 minutes. doesn't sound hard right? wrong!!! i was sweating within the first 5 minutes of the 15 minute time limit. please keep in mind the weights and height of the box were based on what you think you could do and you go at your own pace. there was a lot of encouragement from the instructors as we'll as form correction along the way. even better i did not have someone screaming at me the entire time. i want a tough workout but hey i don't like to be treated as if i am in the marines. next it was time to move to the athletic conditioning class. the female instructor was sure buff and cut. i knew off the bat this would get results if i came on a regular basis. there were 6 stations setup. she went and demonstrated each movement and length of time to stay at each station. 4 of the stations were 2 minute increments and the others were 30 seconds on 30 seconds rest for 2 minutes. this workout looked a lot easier than it was. i am in good shape and i found myself needing to take breaks especially after having finished the crossfit class just prior to this segment. i will be double sore tomorrow. this is what i look for in a class because normally i do not find them challenging enough. i would definitely come back for this class. a quick reminder that all workouts can be scaled to your level so do not be afraid to try these classes. at the end of the event we were treated to either shots of chocolate banana or strawberry banana smoothies. okay no argument on my part i will take one. too bad they weren't spiked..just kidding. it was the perfect and well deserved surprise after a challenging class. we stretched as a group and then class was over. i loved it!!"
4-star,1,"swanky! yes, indeed. metro fitness is a beautiful fitness club. not only will you find tons of great cardio equipment, but there are also plenty of weight machines, free weights and an entire space dedicated to crossfit. so, not only is the gym top notch, but the trainers and management are spot on. they take a great interest in your fitness and walk you through the best ways to get your sweat on. i came to metro for a free crossfit class in honor of yelp kicks butt. i didn't quite know what to expect, but after an hour or so i left happy and worked oooooout. our two trainers, jimmy & thea, put the 16 of us through a rigorous, but inspiring workout, that combined athletic drills, weights, cardio machines and more. they made sure that everyone was working out hard but safe and really explained each exercise and it's importance. dar, the owner, was also on hand to watch our form and generally be awesome. yay for encouragement and super friendly staff! so, i really adore this gym and i would love to join full up and take advantage of the incredible amenities and crossfit classes, but it's pretty out of my budget right now. hopefully metro can offer some other options in the future so those of us who aren't members can come once in a while and enjoy their fantastic gym & classes!"
4-star,1,"if you are looking for a workout, check out metro fitness club. it's located on the second floor above mellow mushroom on selwyn. talk about temptation, there is a pizza place underneath, if you use their cardio equipment you are staring directly at yoforia, reid's fine foods, nolen's kitchen...focus and determination is key. the parking is easy and you can either take the stairs or an elevator to get there. the facility is brand new and it shows. i was completely impressed with the cleanliness, the quality of equipment, and the nice upscale feel of the interior. however, i didn't commit to sign up because it came at a price that was a tad out of my reach for a recreational gym goer, like me. to use the basic facility it is approximately $100 for a couple and it costs a bit more if you want the specialized training program. i've got to say that the training looked intense and no doubt it will for sure get you in shape. i may rethink this after the holidays! *wink* the locker room was really nice, workout towels everywhere, and the staff were friendly as well. it's in a great area with a delicious view!"
5-star,1,"i have been a member for almost a year, love the classes. i mostly attend zumba classes, great instructors. i find the only problem with the classes are some of the people who don't seem to be aware of a few important things. i would like to bring attention to a few basic dance facts: never upstage the instructors. never text while a class is in progress. when the music starts, please refrain from conversations. group dancing is distracting to the instructors and others. if you arrive late, please stay in back. if you need to leave early, please stay in back. be aware of your space and persons on both sides and behind you. do not move all around the room while class is in session. jogging is not acceptable while class is in session. respect the instructor and others while in class. instructors should never be approached while they are instructing. no one has a designated space. doing a different dance from instructor is rude and distracting. if you follow these simple suggestions, everyone can have fun."
5-star,1,"so far this is my favorite gym in arizona. it's variety of locations are convenient and the dollar amount on the membership is right on point with the packed value that the gym brings. what's most important to me at a gym is the vibe and environment, and the people it attracts. this gym attracts and promotes greatness. the motivational posters on the wall down to the types of equipment and classes range from the hardcore and bad ass too the serene and chill for recovery. i had an incredible consultation with will taylor at the scottsdale pavilions location, he helped adjust some flexibility on me and now i feel like i have an upgraded body awareness. he also recommended a trainer exactly for my goals and put the first session on the house since it's those specialties are beyond his scope of practice. very professional. very friendly, very knowledgeable. thanks mountainside. the only upgrade i would like to see is actually the music they play. could be more motivational and have harder beats/songs, better variety instead of just top 20 hits. would like to hear more metal, dubstep, edm, rap, workout music instead of club music (:. one more thing get bigger tires and real tires!!"
5-star,1,"the pima-indianbend location is spectacular! i spent much of the summer in europe bike racing for team usa paralympics. now that i've been back this fall working hard at mountainside, i must compliment the fitness team at this location. everyone here rocks! super friendly, always helpful, the place is kept spotless. not sure how they do it, but it makes the place comfortable and inviting. thanks for another great year, and keep the compliments coming."
1-star,0,this gym offers yoga but unfortunately the noise level from the surrounding classes is so loud and so intense that it shakes the floor. there is no relaxation possible with that much bass permeating through the walls and floor. this issue has been brought to the attention of the management by several people including the yoga instructors and many people in the class and nothing has been done. tyler the manager suggests the only possible recourse is to cancel the classes rather than ask the high intensity classes to turn down the volume. however the noise level in the high intensity classes is already at an unsafe volume it's honestly louder than any concert i've attended. i would not recommend this gym . for the price you should be allowed a quiet atmosphere for yoga and a saf e environment for high intensity classes that does not risk long term hearing loss. also when concerns like these are brought to the attention of management sensible solutions should be sought in a timely manner not ignored. also the temperature of the gym is really warm nearly too hot for cardio.
1-star,0,"this is the worst gym i've ever used, at any location! it is over priced and always packed, their unprofessional associates have less than enough experience. if you want to try and cancel forget it, they will steal your money! i am not one to write reviews, but after speaking with unprofessional staff at the corporate level and getting nowhere as well as not having a customer support service here i am. consider yourself warned!"
1-star,0,it's extremely irritating when you have your headphones turned up to max and you can still hear the lady next to you on the elliptical talking on the phone.
2-star,0,"if you like a warm gym, mountainside fitness is for you! i have been a member there a few months, and while on the treadmills, i have been pouring sweat during my hour-long runs. i'm a proficient runner who has qualified for the boston marathon, so this has nothing to do with fitness. rather, the company informed me that as per company policy, the gym is set to 74 degrees! as a former personal trainer and someone who's been around gyms since the early 90s, mountainside fitness operates the warmest chain of gyms i've ever experienced. when a gym temperature is set to 74 (most gyms are around 68 degrees), that doesn't account for the concentrated workout areas such as the treadmill area. all of the body heat can add an increased temperature variance of 4-6 degrees. i brought my digital thermometer in there last weekend when the treadmills were packed and it read 80-degrees. it was also insanely humid (probably due to the sheer sweat volume of everyone doing cardio in an oven) other chains such as lifetime fitness and gold's gym keep their temps well into the 60's (lifetime fitness keeps theirs at 67 degrees). so if you don't like a warm gym, and don't like sweating to an unnecessary degree when on the treadmill or other cardio machines, mountainside fitness won't be the gym for you. serious runners and athletes would much prefer lifetime fitness. i used to be a member there and running in the cool temps they set is wonderful! i'll be cancelling my membership and heading over to lifetime soon, as will a few of my friends. a gym that skimps on ac to save money isn't worth my time. smarten up mountainside!"
2-star,0,"as someone that was in club management for many years in the d.c. area, i'll do my best to give a fair review. i'm only giving two stars for the following reasons... i will say that the club is very clean. hands down, they have a crew that comes in during the day and thoroughly cleans the equipment and the amenities and they do a very good job of it. other clubs have a bit to be desired in this area, so i'll give ms a big thumbs up for that. they also have a great variety of equipment for everyone. free weights, a big assortment of cable machines, etc, and it's not an intimidating atmosphere by any stretch (which is great for anyone just starting out). if a piece of equipment is down, it normally gets fixed in a few days (to be fair from experience, equipment repair specialists don't grow on trees and have previous scheduled calls). where i fault the club is that they don't enforce any of their own policies: quite a few signs banning cell phone talking and members pay zero attention to that. staff, to include management, have walked by individuals yapping on their phones and haven't said anything. if i have to crank up my headphones due to someone being loud on their phone, that's a problem. i've watched people take selfies in the mirrors with unknowing members in the background, and that's a privacy no-no. they also don't enforce the dropping of weights (which tends to sound like a b-52 strike in the distance), and members have also shown up in flip-flops (or no shoes at all) and i'm pretty sure that's a health code thing in az. these are policies that are plainly posted, however to my knowledge have never been enforced. all in all, the club is ok at best. just waiting for equinox to open up in scottsdale....eventually."
2-star,0,"after a year of coming here is still two stars, facility equipment has improved and the staff still wonderful, but if i hear one more excuse about their cable provider and the kind of service they receive, i am going to hold payment from my bank, i just paid an annual additional fee for club improvements and the tvs still not working. get it together people everything else is working fine."
2-star,0,for $43 a month you'd think there'd be better customer service and friendlier staff. not a very welcoming environment to walk into.
1-star,0,"i've been in my new home for about 5 months. during those 5 months, i've wanted to test the mountainside fitness gym that was literally across the street. why i didn't is why many people don't. the process is one of the worst consumer experiences i have every experienced. over the past 4 months i've checked in on their website. the cost has always been the same. i thought about just signing up and dealing with whether i even liked the place after the fact. they offered a 5-day free trial. i printed it out and looked at it for a month. did i really want to go through the process? today (4th of july) i decided i'd force myself through it. that was at 7am. being just across the street you might think i'd be there by 7:30 - 8 at the latest, right? try 1pm. that is how long i put it off. so... i bet you are thinking that it was all in my head and everything went as you would expect, right? you would be wrong. so... walking in, i fill out the form, the form is given to some man younger than my daughter, and proceeded to take me on a facility tour. when we arrive back at his desk he starts talking about packages. i explain to him that i've watched the plans online for a few months, i am aware of the costs and what i was planning on doing is using the 5-day pass for a few visits at different times of day and see if the club has the capacity to meet its membership. i'm not going to pay $50 a month to wait for equipment. so... the sales guy tells me the following - word for word - if you leave the club today without buying a membership, you will have to pay $95 to use the rest of your free 5-day pass. are you serious? yes he said, club policy. i nearly lost my cool, but held on. i may join, but they took a 100% sure deal and made it a maybe - and i will tell every person i can what a slimy place mountainside fitness is. i will spend the next few hours posting this experience many different places."
5-star,1,"needed a place to workout in arizona as 24 hour fitness has packed up and left, and my parents had previously been members of mountainside. michael quickly got me set up with a membership and was more than helpful with any questions i had. the staff, no matter what time of day (i work graveyard so to keep my body clock right, this was 4:30am) were friendly and cordial and the free coffee was a welcome surprise. the facilities are kept clean and there are plenty of weight stations, mat space for stretching, suspension training and cardio equipment (hooray for the gym that has arc trainers). the locker room/showers are always clean and well stocked with soap and the towel supply (always a plus) is frequently replenished. it surprised me how crowded it was early with at least 7 personal trainers all working with clients, all with smiles. saw many of the same people every day and it appeared to be a communal environment."
1-star,0,"this use to be the best gym around. now since multiple changes in policies it has turned into a dump. they give ""guest passes"" that are only good for people that haven't ever been members. due to friends coming back in town for the holidays. i have been unable to workout with them unless they want to pay $10 for a day pass. why should you give guess passes and restrict my use of them. i was a member for 3 years and just canceled my membership today. i urge anyone to go to another gym for this along with multiple other reasons."
4-star,1,"we joined mountainside fitness since we moved farther away from the gold's-turned-eos we'd been members of for a few years. the cost is a bit more, but the amenities are clearly on a nicer level. enrollment was easy and when we both turned down their complimentary personal training session that comes with each membership, we weren't pressured about it. i've never had any issue with any of the cardio machines. (and i see people wipe down their machines all the time--not sure what the review stating differently is about.) there are a ton of weight machines and free weights. i've never had any problem finding space to do my workouts or find the right weights. everyone is pretty conscious to re-rack and put their dumbbells in the proper place, which is eons better than the crowd at gold's/eos. i've taken some power yoga classes, and their yoga studio is much nicer than i expected from a non-yoga studio. i don't love that there's a random wall right in the middle of the room, but i guess it doesn't affect the classes. the class itself is awesome for a workout, but there's not much of the hippy-dippy, introspective namaste vibe that made me fall in love with yoga. still, if you want to sweat, it's perfect. the locker rooms look really nice (haven't actually used them yet since we live so close), and the cafe/smoothie area seems well stocked. and there's free coffee in the morning! so, on a scale of my now-defunct golds/eos membership and my current membership to the village health clubs and spas, i'd say mountainside is a perfect match in-between the two levels."
2-star,0,love the gym love my friends there but too many times they don't show up to open in the morning it's very discouraging to those of us with a time frame.
1-star,0,"this gym might be ok for some classes or weights but forget it if you want to use the steppers. the machines are in the last row and high up, the hardest machine in the hottest area with no air circulation. but worst of all usually 2 of the 6 are not working at any time. many of us have complained repeatedly and no one ever does anything about it. so that is 1/3 or 33% of the equipment that does not work and is always ""under repair"". one machine has been down for months. it is infuriating. there are elliptical machines that there are many of in the back row as well. these could be replaced with more steppers, but at least if they kept the 6 repaired. but that appears tp be to much to ask."
5-star,1,nice friendly staff. open with lots of equipment choices. nice and clean. looks like a recent renovation. juice bar. bathrooms are nice.
1-star,0,i rushed over after work to speak to someone in regards the rates. i was told that it would be a few minutes since gentleman was all ready in the middle of signing up a new client. the reception was kind enough to show me around while i was waiting. after the tour client had left and customer service rep sat at his chair for a good hour. i got up and ask reception and she said that he knew i was there and would grab me he was ready. in the meantime his feet were up on the desk and have a full on conversation with what sounded like his girlfriend. i was so disgusted i walked out and left. reception was very apologetic. really disappointed.
4-star,1,"this gym has everything i need for a good workout...lots of cardio equipment, weight machines, free weights, and a pretty generous amount of free classes (i've done some of the yoga and fitness classes and like them all, though sometimes the room is crowded so try to get there a bit early). my son goes to the childcare and i am comfortable leaving him there and he is happy with it. it's not the cheapest gym, but it's not the worst, either, and since i need a place with a non-scary and convenient childcare it's definitely the best local choice. there are some extra scottsdale-y members but that's just the location, and doesn't reflect upon the gym itself, and there are plenty of ""normal people"" there, too. overall, it's a good place to go!"
4-star,1,"pretty good gym. i like that they have power yoga, and the teachers are sometimes comparable to those of private yoga studios! they just remodeled and added a new spin room. i think there will be more construction underway soon so just be aware of that! i like that they have internet, i don't like that they don't display the password where you can see it (like on a treadmill). i hate when i'm already working out and i go to use my spotify only to realize i didn't get the password and cannot listen to my music. they need to fix that. also, they have towels available, which is great! gold's gym on northsight does not provide towels so this is a huge plus."
1-star,0,"mountainside is not only the worst fitness club i have ever seen but the worst business ever. not only do they not care about their members but in fact they don't care about the health and safety... and her's proof. some ""genius"" decided that they needed high intensity lights that strobe to the music in the spin room. most members, and even instructors, complained and several had to stop spinning as they were getting migraines. rather than removing the lights the club removed the switch taht allowed us to switch them off. in my case one day i became highly disoriented and nauseous. i felt as though i was about to faint so i got off the bike, visually indicated to randy the instructor, that i felt bad and i left the spin room. i went to the manager's office to report this. then i sat down to avoid collapsing. numerous members, as well as several of your own staff, saw me and saw that i was in obvious distress, as did others in the spin class. despite my very obvious distress at no time did randy bother to check on me when i left the class or after, which is totally irresponsible on his part. furthermore none of the club staff offered to get a doctor or an ambulance, or drive me to an emergency clinic. in fact i had to request an advil or tylenol and even that was not readily available. later that same day ms. sarah mitcham, the club manager, called me to tell me that i had caused a disruption leaving the class and hence my membership was cancelled effective immediately. she did not even have the decency to ask for my version of events. it seems that the instructor had told her that i had caused a disturbance in leaving the class. not only do i deny this but several members who were in the same class have offered to testify that i did not cause any disturbance and they too object to the strobe lights and feel they are detrimental to their well-being. upon further investigation it appears that i may have suffered a slight seizure. there are numerous medical articles, which claim that strobing lights are a cause of seizures even in people who do not have epilepsy, and even lighting companies sell such lighting systems with warnings. i wrote a letter to the club president asking to discuss this but he didn't have the courtesy to replay which is just further proof that they don't care about their members."
1-star,0,"jan's review pretty much sums up everything i feel. my wife and i have been members for about 6 years. the new renovation was a joke. new floors and annoying disco lights in spin. bikes still same old pieces of junk. loose handlebars & seats. they are worn out and used up; they need to be replaced. and all the better spin instructors jumped ship and are gone. recumbent bikes all have loose seats and no pedal straps. wide screen theatre area has 3 seats! really. not enough weights and equipment for muscle classes. my wife has been waiting 3 yrs for promised additional weights. free towels are nice but are now all ratty and feel like a steel wool pad. time to replace them. mountainside, it's time to get your act together."
5-star,1,"i have been a member here for several months now and i love it here. i read some of the reviews of the gym and was disgusted by what some people wrote about this place. obviously someone needs to learn some respect and control themselves. i don't believe destroying other peoples property is the way to make a point. i wonder why they looked at you funny...? grow up. anyway, this gym is actually very nice. the staff is very friendly and the gym is always clean. the classes are great and there are usually always on time. i love the space this gym has. the locker rooms are not at all like the ones at most other gyms i have been to. they are spacious and that hairy naked guy that parades himself about in every gym is defiantly absent (thank goodness). all in all, the atmosphere is very relaxing and quiet for a gym. it keeps me motivated and going. highly recommended!"
5-star,1,"new to yelp, but i have been a mountainside fitness member for four years. the clubs across the valley are always clean and comfortable. my main club on shea and sahuaro dr just did a redo of the look and feel and the place feel brand new. the equipment is always clean and in proper working order. the locker rooms are not scary and the interaction with the staff keeps me getting up and coming in early even on the ""coldest"" mornings in scottsdale."
1-star,0,"i just got a letter in the mail telling me that moutainside is changing the terms of our contract and is now going to start charge me a ""annual enhancement fee of $25 for your individual plan"". so lemme get this straight.. i'm being penalized for being single? yeah, there's this guy named uncle sam who already screws me over for being single and having a good job...i don't need my gym doing that too. especially when there is abby bella dance studio an la fitness and 24 hour fitness close by (i'll give you their addresses if you're interested in not being taken advantage of). seriously..the audacity and what's an enhancement fee anyway? unless liposuction is now included in my membership, i'm taking my business elsewhere. ***update: mountainside management's definition of an ""enhancement fee"" is a joke. i'm going to file that explanation under not my problem. what you consider ""enhancements"" that you want to charge me a surplus for (without my consent) most of the general public would consider operation costs and keeping up with competition. this isn't a condo association. i don't have any invested stake or profit sharing with this company and therefore mountainside shouldn't be allowed to charge what i would consider to be a b*s* special assessment. further stating this fee is an ""industry standard"" is a farce. in the past i have been a member at: 24hr fitness, la fitness, xsport, abby bella and bally's...none of these gyms have ever tried to sneak in some annual ""enhancement fee"" ever.. so who are you comparing yourself too? lastly, since i've been bashing you all over town i just found out my co-worker who also has a membership at your club isn't getting charged this annual enhancement fee...how fair is that?"
4-star,1,"we've had a family membership here for a couple years now and we love it. would do 5 stars if they had a pool or other water related items but still gets a strong 4 stars. not long ago they remodeled this location an added a boxing ring, new machines etc. i have a vip locker that i love they do my laundry daily and put clean towels, a bottle of water and a fresh mint in my locker each day all for about $1.25 per day. they have 15 of these lockers located in their own special area with tv's nice leather benches etc. the lockers are huge with push botton codes no locks. the gym is always clean. the child care is fantastic open 7 days a week my children love it. they even have parents night out where you can bring your children for a couple hours on friday night and go out while they do arts and crafts. the juice bar has shakes with all natural ingredients and its almost always open. the location is very convenient on shea and 116th street. theres a full size indoor basketball court and to many other amenities to list oh yea a dry heat sauna and my favorite the steam room. huge selection of weights and bikes. if you live in the area this is the gym for you."
1-star,0,"avoid like the plague! terrible people rip-off scam, they sign you up after a groupon offering great value, carry on charging you when your not even in the country, i have since left the us and explained my situation to the manager -- who then decides to send a conned contract to a debt collection agency. avoid - do not deal with this company!!"
4-star,1,the yoga classes here are wonderful. some start as early as 6:30 am which is a great way to start the day. i also appreciate the fact that they have saturday and sunday classes.
4-star,1,"this is a very nice, new looking gym. the layout of the gym is great since the cardio location overlooks the whole place. i like the tvs on each of the cardio equipment as well. the machines and benches are all better quality than other gyms have--feel more comfy with more padding. there's a bball court as well. i've never done any group classes but they have 1 or 2 rooms for those as well. i think membership is somewhere around $40/month which is on par for this level of gym."
1-star,0,"wow, all i can say is this place sucks big balls. take your money to 24 hour fitness (which is literally 3 minutes from here), where your business will be appreciated. my boyfriend and i joined back in early summer. we paid for 2 full-year memberships. we paid nearly $500 each, which i feel is high for a gym. don't go here if you are interested in a serious workout... all the women come all dolled up. and all the guys are meatheads (especially the trainers, who need to really lay off the roids). the gym is very nice... clean, good/new equipment. the reason for the 1 star, however, is due to their policies and lack of customer service. when joining, they rush you through the contract to get you to sign, skipping over the fact that you are responsible for inquiring any additional fees that they deem as necessary. so, after my boyfriend and i had been working out at this location for a month, we got a bill in the mail saying we owed an additional $52 for their renovations. excuse me!?! this gym is like 5 years old... when i called to ask what specifically the charges were for, the manager told me it was for the new imax theater, valet parking.... the list goes on. are you serious!? valet parking at a gym? i've never heard of something so absurd. get exercise and walk to your own car... this is a gym for goodness sakes! they refused to take the charges off my bill even though i would never use their useless new amenities. they said if the charges weren't paid by the due date, i wouldn't be able to work out until they were paid off (with late fees). hahaha. so i went to craigslist, sold both my memberships and my 20 personal training sessions. and i didn't have to pay their outrageous fees. there were other shortcomings, but honestly, my bp is already going through the roof from writing this review. i'm done. you can go fuck yourself mountainside fitness!!"
5-star,1,the classes and facilities are phenomenal. highly recommend msf! they're always updating the facilities and keep everything top notch!
2-star,0,"after going to la fitness (moon valley) for about 12 years my wife and i finally made a decision to make the switch and join this gym. this was mainly because of the location, plus the new one is opening at happy valley which is even going to be closer to me so the convenience factor played the biggest role in my decision. anyways, the gym is different and so is the equipment so i knew it would take some time to adjust. but after attending mountainside for few weeks i'm definitely a bit frustrated and i kinda regret my decision. i honestly don't understand the price difference (at la we we paying $50 for both of us, here we're paying about $70) but we literally get nothing extra. yes the locker rooms are little nicer here but that's about it. anyways, i am mainly frustrated with the equipment more than anything. everything moves and the machines are way too close to one another. like uncomfortably close, at least when compared to my old gym. the machines are not stationary (drilled into the floor) so when i try to do some curls the whole machine moves (one time it slid to the left and made contact with the guy next to me. the plates are metal and rusted! why couldn't they have rubber around them? this way you can't use them for any exercise other than to load on the machines and then lift. i'm really really hoping that this happy valley location will be little better. otherwise i'll probably go back. fingers crossed."
1-star,0,"i have going to this location for awhile and take my kids to the child care. my kids keep getting sick from this location and today i know why. the children's club manager is negligent in that she allows sick kids into the club. this morning i saw a very sick child in the kid's club area and i informed them that the kid looked sick. they said it was okay because the mother said ""the child is on antibiotics, so it's okay."" the poor child appeared very miserable and snot covered his face. i told the kid's manager about how the child, she said that as long as the snot's not coming out green, it's fine. she was very short and had an attitude that i expressed concern. she finished the brief conversation being snippy, saying that's it's just my preference if i wanted to put my kids in there. clearly i quickly left, not wanting to expose my healthy children to the child who is so sick that he's on antibiotics. i am appalled and disgusted by the kid's club judgement and lack of customer service. i will not be coming back to that location and will be letting everyone know of their child care negligence, irresponsibility, and lack of human decency."
4-star,1,"this is the only gym i've been to aside from ones on university campuses and i really enjoy coming here. the staff is super friendly, the facility and locker rooms are clean. for $44/mo you get unlimited access to the gym and classes - yoga, pilates, zumba, etc. the rate goes down to $38/mo if you sign the yearly contract. you also get guest passes and can bring in family members for free every sunday. i especially like the fact that they're open pretty late (until 11 pm weekdays and 9 pm weekends), since i'm a habitual night owl. they're currently updating the cardio equipment - new treadmills now have wifi and streaming capabilities, perfect for watching netflix during those long runs! hoping that they'll upgrade the elliptical and bicycles soon too, which are starting to look a little rundown. there are plenty of free weights and machines for strength training, also a basketball court. other features: a smoothie/protein shake station, childcare area, sauna in the locker room. i tried one free training session and didn't love it, but that was a couple years ago so can't speak for the current trainers. one personal pet peeve i have here is the fact that many gymgoers like to use outdoor voices in the indoor weights area. literally happens every other time i come here and distracts from the workout experience, but i guess you can't force people to be considerate!"
2-star,0,"i have attended the surprise, peoria and north phoenix locations. i had a really bad experience at the north phoenix location. i was looking for a mat area to stretch before my spin class. the only mat i could find was apparently some private class. it was not clearly marked as private. i was treated very rudely and abrasively. i tried another area for stretching but the private class took all the mats. it should have been clearly labeled as private and members should not have to go without club amenities like a mat to stretch on."
2-star,0,"love the classes, just wish they had more. forget about taking a class on friday sat or sun. those are my days off and i wanna sleep in. but you have to get in early and few classes to choose from. daycare is revamped with a new crew. daycare closes at 3 on sunday. can you please stay open till 5 at least? all these things are not brought up when you sign the contract. so get a month to month membership. staff is friendly, love lori and her yoga class. she's so great!!"
1-star,0,"courtney at guest services is so rude and un professional. she gave me a hard time about a promotion i brought in, sent directly from mountain side! she was rude about the situation, didn't explain anything and then didn't even honor the entire promo as there was other free things included. she is always on her cell phone, and then never at the desk where she should be working, but up walking and talking to people or in the child care area talking with her children she leaves in there all day. i am not the only one that noticed this as a few other members and workers have said the same thing about their experience with her."
1-star,0,"the mountainside fitness north phoenix location is reneging on contractual commitments. i purchased a $3700 personal training package, and they are refusing to honor the unlimited expiration date portion of it. jeremy the general manager there is on accommodating and unhelpful. don't do personal training through mountain fitness"
5-star,1,"no only does the gym have all the equipment necessary to keep my workouts new and fun after the remodel, but it is cared for by a team of friendly and attentive staff. as a new mom, i am so thankful for the child care center within the gym. a special shout out to all the ladies that give extra attention to my little one so her mommy can get in a completed workout. i appreciate being able to get back to the gym as i love lifting weights. from obtaining my membership to signing up for child care to becoming one of the every day gym rats, they always make me feel welcome and like a friend."
1-star,0,"we joined based on the classes that they offered and the daycare option. one month after joining three of the classes were canceled and never came back. when my child was five months old, i watched one of the daycare girls hold my daughter on her hip with one hand like she was a-year-old. when my daughter fell backwards, because of her lack of neck strength, the girl had to literally catch her from falling. never went back."
1-star,0,was a member for many years! i cancelled because a lot of the equipment was not working for a long time. then they charged us a yearly fee to maintain the equipment. lol what a joke! i was disappointed for sure!
2-star,0,"most of the mountainsides are really nice with the exception of the carefree highway location. old equipment, machines broken since 5/1 still not fixed, old and overused spin bikes always breaking, towel baskets and sanitary machine wipes often empty! issues with this gym common theme on neighborhood news feed...needs serious attention!"
5-star,1,i just joined mountainside fitness (mf) oat the arrowhead location with my bff. so far my experience has been outstanding. met with brian in the personal training dept for 1 hour consultation. he was very knowledgeable & we learned a lot about all components for a successful lifestyle change! now i have visited their carefree & i17 location since it's closer to my house - so if my bff isn't working out i still go ... just to carefree location instead. the staff at both locations have been extremely friendly!!! today i took m1 with dana (carefree) & she was incredible!!!! she also recommended another class to help with learning the moves to help me with m1 class. that class beat me today ... but i will be back!!! if you want to join a gym that completely makes you comfortable going too no matter your weight / looks etc than join!!! hopefully you tell them i referred you! see ya there!
1-star,0,"lots of empty machines, but i always have to wait for the ones i need. they might want to rethink their inventory. it's too hot in this gym. they're stingy on the ac and their wifi never works. we quit the gym after a rep got smart with me when i asked him why the wifi never works. maybe he'll think twice about being a smartass to customers in the future, or maybe not. not my problem anymore. also, they offer 10 free passes per year, but they don't tell you that the passes have to be used by different guests. only 2 free passes per guest!"
4-star,1,have been a member at this gym for a few years. would be nice to have some better fans that actually work. try looking at bigassfans.com.
5-star,1,"was a member for about a year or so when i lived nearby. the gym was always very clean and well cared for. generally if a piece of equipment was down, it wasn't down for very long. the staff was always helpful and attentive and i never had any negative experiences when going there. sadly i moved away and need to find a new gym but if anyone is looking for a nice, comfortable gym with a ton of options, mountainside fits the bill."
4-star,1,"4 stars only because of: no water fountain in locker room no paper towel to dry hands after washing the in the bathroom & the hand blower is ancient. you have to hand over your membership pass to get checked in - why can't i scan it myself - it traffic jams the lobby. the annual "" enhancement fee of 20$ pro: most of the staff is friendly, especially troy & tami. tons of weights and machines, 10 + benches! never wait on chest day ha! trx set up! large side area for exercises like abs, lunges, stretching, box jumps no stupid lunk alarms hours are great tons of cardio equipment, basketball court, rock wall, tanning, steam room, sauna. 10 guest passes and sunday free family day access to all the other locations protein shake bar - custom order shakes billed to your account if you want all in call, the price is average. the place is clean, and with a few adjustments, it would be 5/5 i have already had 2 guest in my first 2 weeks, both signed up to within a few days. i recommend it!"
1-star,0,"horrible experience still going on. i joined mountainside fitness because it had a couple of good step instructors.(although in the summertime, it gets very hot there - even have to open the door - to get air!!) after about a year, i began working every day so i put my membership on hold (they charged me $10 a month) until i determined whether or not i would be able to attend classes. i renewed the hold status once, for a total of 6 months. on the last renewal of the hold status, i was told that unless i went back to being a regular member after the 3 months was over and wanted to join at a later date, my membership would expire and i would have to pay the initiation fee again. since i was still working and found other classes elsewhere at times that were convenient to me, i let the membership expire. little did i realize that they began to charge me for full membership when the ""hold"" status expired! i never discovered it (they deducted for 2 months) until my credit card was breached, my cc company replaced the old one, and when mountainside tried to make the auto deduction, it didn't go through. when i told them that i was no longer a member and what i had been told, they basically said tough - i owed them for 2 more months in addition to he two they charged me for, and i would have to go into the office and formally withdraw. i did go into one of the centers about a month later, and let them know that i was no longer a member, reiterated what their rep had told me - that membership would automatically expire if i didn't renew the hold status. they insisted that i pay the fees that they are continuing to charge me. i told the no, i wouldn't, and that they had already gotten 2 months of fees that they didn't deserve, and that we could call it a wash. she refused. the membership director called, insisting that i pay ""what i owed them."" the fees are now a little over $150 and they continue to send me bills every month, (so the total continues to grow), e-mails, calls, dunning notices, etc. this place is has horrible customer service. they are snotty and arrogant - they are not even taking responsibility for what their staff tells people. just the fact that they require you to come in and drop instead of being able to drop by phone is a pain and tells me that they are desperate for money - or greedy - take your choice. mind bogling"
4-star,1,"i had membership at mountain side fitness before i shifted to la fitness to reclaim some of my unused training sessions. objectively speaking, mountain side fitness is a level above la fitness with a premium look and feel, and overall better services for clients - free towels, an executive room for members who pay more and a really good child care center; they even have a channel on each of the cardio machines that lets you watch the camera feed from the kids room. also, they have a small café where you can order shakes/smoothies/juices of your choice - billed directly to your monthly statement. coming to cardio and other weight equipment, the equipment at mountain side fitness is not that different from other gyms like la fitness or 24 hours fitness and their personal training offerings are not very different compared to other gyms. and with respect to membership prices, it is a little higher than la fitness (about $5 - $8 more) but you get what you pay for. personal training, like at other gyms, runs you about $40-$45 a sessions depending upon your package. overall, the gym exudes a premium look and feel and the services and do live up to that image."
2-star,0,"scottsdale mountainside has it down when it comes to customer service, towels and keys. scottsdale also has a cabinet that keeps your keys by number at front desk, try it. also, stuck up staff is not a good look."
5-star,1,"the people at mountain side are so friendly and warm. willing to help you out and do what it takes to make you feel at home. i signed up in march and got to try a personal trainer through ryan. ryan has went over and beyond my expectations with being so helpful, patient, understanding, and very personable. he put me with an amazing personal trainer david! david have helped me understand my form better and what to do with my workouts and i love gaining the understanding on what i need to do to help me with my bad knees. i strongly recomend working with ryan to get all figured out on where you need to go next through your fitness journey! and ask to work with david as a personal trainer! you won't regret it!"
3-star,0,"i have been a member at mountainside for almost 3 years and have complained about the same thing for the entire time....the music sucks so bad! i love this gym and all my friends go there and we absolutely love our trainer mark olson! but they play adel, james blunt and other slow, depressing music. i love adel and james blunt, but not to work out to! because i work with a trainer and read my ipad while i'm on cardio, i can't use my ipod to drown out the music. so...their music sucks. i love the employees and the daycare is awesome. love the activities for kids. love osr being on site for my semi-frequent strains. love the equipment. it's rarely out of order. i love the snack bar but would love to see a juicer! a juice bar would be awesome! fix the dang music and you would almost be perfect."
1-star,0,"troy at mountainside/carefree hwy should be fired. for an enrollment clerk he is impersonal, rude and condescending. ""i have no idea what these charges are for, i just charge them. what the company does with them has nothing to do with me."" wow. never even asked what the company does with the fees, just what the different fees were. i wish there was another gym option close by....."
5-star,1,"it's a gym so what can i say? i hate them. i hate having to go there. i think we should all by healthy & skinny always. reality says that for a gym this one rocks. super clean & the equipment is in great shape. the locker rooms are clean too. they have tanning, childcare, & a hair salon & chiropractor. shawn is sales is the best & you should talk to him if you need a membership."
5-star,1,"finally getting around to my reviews. got to give good ones where they are due! this gym made me into a gym rat and i enjoyed it. this place worked for me. i liked the laid back atmosphere and enjoyed seeing the many familiar smiling faces when i was there. i purchased trainer sessions when i first joined. i started with a trainer that really helped me overcome some of my sports injuries. i enjoyed the personal workouts and they imparted knowledge on various techniques. i continued with trainers for several years. i had to leave my trainer, melanie when i moved and am still devastated."
1-star,0,"i joined on a month-to-month plan in july, 2012. the gym is pretty good, no real complaints about the facility or staff. in september, they hit me with a $25 ""enhancement fee"" out of the blue. the claim from corporate billing was that this is in the contract. i don't remember anything about it, and i'm completely sure it was never pointed out by the guy that signed me up. so, they get $25 and lose the $40 a month i was paying for membership. good for them. i don't do business that way, and i won't do business with anyone who does if i can help it."
5-star,1,"i signed up here on march 2, 2012. i have been everyday except friday, sats and suns since. i love this place! i hate the way i am so out of shape and how i am reminded of this every time i walk in, but by the time i walk out, i realize, that i am getting in shape and that makes me love mountainside. the gym is clean, the place is never so busy that there aren't any machines or equipment available. the trainers are all really great. they build quick rapports with their clients and you feel good when you walk out knowing you got a great workout in. the ladies locker room and sauna are magnificent. the fees were reasonable and my husband joined with me at the same time so we saved quite a bit. mountainside is doing the health business just right. eli and chris are great trainers, motivators, and fair guys. i highly recommend them for your first understanding of what training will consist of. troy was our advisor who signed us up and he was really friendly and attentive to our discussion. i was worried about the kids aspect, but to be honest, not a problem at all. right on mountainside. finally a gym i can walk into and feel at home. i will continue my 4days a week for the next 6 months and when i jump into that size 4 bikini this summer, i am making sure to give mountainside all the credit!"
5-star,1,"i was dying for a gym within 10 miles of here and finally got it. it had almost everything, a great selection of classes, lots of cardio machines, ample free weights and weight machines, basketball court, rock wall, child care, hair salon, tanning, massage services, sauna & steam rooms in the locker rooms, i am probably missing something. the only thing i think is missing is a lap pool. this gym opened in nov, 2008. it's newer, well maintained and a great choice!"
1-star,0,"this place is absolutely terrible. the gym it self looks nice upon first going in, but the equipment in frequently out of order and rarely clean. they offer customers clean towels, but nothing to clean the equipment with after use. they're also thieves, with no real cancellation policy other then what they feel like telling you at that very moment. i tried to cancel do to the lack of hygiene in the place, and they told me i would forfeit my last months payment (never discussed in the contract) as well as pay 25% of what was left. this place really needs to step it up. i would not suggest that anyone waste their money here."
3-star,0,"this location is one of the best run and most advanced gyms i have ever been to. i've been a member of every major gym in the phoenix area and mountainside fitness (the cc location specifically) was nicely sized with plenty to do for everybody. there are other locations (phoenix/scottsdale) that are completely tiny and worthless unless you like waiting for weights, benches, and even machines."
5-star,1,"i could not be happier with this gym! i think the price is incredibly fair for the amenities and how nice the facility is. as a stay at home mom (i have a 1.5 year old) i am especially impressed with the childcare. the ladies are so patient and kind. my daughter was scared at first, now reaches for the staff when we get in there. the best part is that they have cameras and you can watch your kiddos while you work out. every time i'm there they are always cleaning and disinfecting all the toys. i love this place and i'm thankful to have somewhere i trust to leave my daughter."
1-star,0,"i enjoyed going here for the few months i lived in peoria. but after claiming you could quit any time, they made quitting impossible and were super shady about it. i filled out a form to cancel before i moved away. but i kept getting charges. for months. and threats about ""collections"". jeez, you can see i haven't used the gym since i quit two months ago, what the hell? danielle s, the manager, kept claiming since i didn't make a copy of my cancellation form it never happened. strange, that was never an option when i filled it out! and demanding i come in person to fill out the form again! i moved away! in this day and age why on earth would someone have to physically drive to a location to fill out a form? email it! mail it! no reason. just playing games to rack up charges while providing no services. also known as...fraud. technically. you know, legally, fraud. ars 13-2310."
1-star,0,"these people have no idea about common sense and logic. we had a group of 5 who wanted to try out mountainside fitness. we all have arizona id, except for one of us. we all live and work in az, including the one who didn't have an arizona drivers license, and we offered proof that she worked and lived in arizona. but they refused to let her try a 5day pass because she did not have an official arizona drivers license. this makes no sense. she could prove that she works and lives in az, but they refused to let her join us. we are upset because she drove all the way from scottsdale to go try it out with us, but they wouldn't let her in still even though she could prove that she both lives and works here. this place sucks i recommend going to absolutely any other gym"
1-star,0,"i was a member for over 2 years. i signed a personal training contract. over the course of the past year i have been through 3 trainers who have quit or who were fired. the trainers were excellent and knowledgable. after the 3rd one left i was fed up with the turnover. i contacted the arrowhead training manager to be let out of my remaining training sessions. my schedule had drastically changed after starting a new business and it was increasingly harder to make it on a regular basis. add to that the thought of starting all over again with yet another trainer. i was told by the manager brian that he would speak to the vp. after 3-4 emails to brian i emailed the vp mario. i emailed him twice about the situation at arrowhead location. i explained my situation in detail. i never got any response from either email. i also called vp mario on 2 separate occasions, left a voice mail. again no response or call. i then called and asked to speak to the owner or president. i was told i could not have their emails. they told me mario was the one to talk to about complaints or concerns. i explained that mario had chosen to ignore all 4 of my attempts to contact him. i got one phone message from mario and told him when i could be reached...no attempt was made on his part to reach me again. this is the final ( and 3rd) email i sent. i have never gotten any response. what a disgraceful company. taking money for services not rendered, not responding to a member's concerns. i know i am not the only one who has encountered this. shame on you mountainside fitness!!!! october 4, 2017 mario - i am sorry i missed your call monday afternoon at 3:45 p.m. i was in a meeting. i e-mailed you that i would be available after 4:15 p.m. i did not hear from you either via e-mail or phone. i also did not hear from you the next day to follow-up. to say that i am frustrated is an understatement. i have been trying to deal with and get resolution to my issues since august 14. i e-mailed back and forth with brian with no results or true actions. on august 28 i decided to deal with you with the expectation that the vp would certainly be more concerned about his clientele and be professional in his actions and response times. i e-mailed you on august 28 and then about 5-7 days later. i received no acknowledgement that you had even read or received my e-mails and my concerns. i then called you on september 18 and left voicemail for you. i again called and left a voicemail for you on september 25. again there was no response. so now it is 4 weeks since my communication efforts with you have started and 6 weeks since this entire situation started. i have asked to be refunded for my remaining 93 sessions and have just been told i could be provided another trainer. brian said if i could not make my appointments he would have some resolution for me. ( that was the e-mail from late august ). personal training, by nature, requires personal attention. the health and fitness industry is a service based industry. clients need to feel they are valued, respected and have a positive and encouraging relationship with the trainer and the other gym personnel. sadly this appears not to be the case or priority with mountainside fitness. how have your actions and your team members accomplished this? they haven't and you haven't. i feel like my concerns and my issues are being swept under the rug in hopes of it just going away. to have this as the culture in your managers and this company is so sad. this very poorly handled situation has fractured our client relationship beyond repair. there has been no respect, no efforts, and definitely no customer service. i can't truly believe that under these circumstances you will not honor my request. would you really ask that i continue to work out in such a negative environment? are you really going to keep the money for the services you could no longer provide me in a suitable manner? i simply want final resolution to this manner in the form of the refund for the 93 sessions. it has been 6 weeks with no efforts on the part of this company. refunding the sessions will take very little effort on your part. if this cannot be resolved in accordance with what i am asking then i will have to pursue more formal avenues of resolution that will bring public awareness of the poor overall culture at this company. sincerely, leigh ann stastny"
1-star,0,be very careful of fitness training. my trainer pushed my workout to the point where i had injury to my knees and back. in pt now and canceled membership and no reimbursement for unused training sessions.
1-star,0,"extremely poor customer service at this particular location. treated like a number, not a member, when i brought my father (senior citizen from out of town) with me to workout. very corporate feel with an emphasis on high pressure sales and zero flexibility for an old man that forgot to bring an id with him. ""member safety"" being quoted as policy and reasoning for 25 minute wait to get a sales pitch from member services. manager could not think on his feet or provide any reasoning for the inconvenience, he could only recite policy like a corporate drone. my father is on record as having been a guest of mine in the past. flexibility and doing what's best for the gym and the membership should be management's focus and what separates this gym from others. not the case in this instance. substandard treatment by staff and disappointing lack of flexibility and discretion by management."
5-star,1,i've had a membership at just about every gym out there and this gym beats all of them. they always keep everything super clean and even though it's packed they have ample machines to be able to work out on! we go multiple times a week and the gym is always packed with people which says a lot about the fact people choose this gym over all others!
1-star,0,"i came in to try this gym. i was filling out the waiver and info sheet and the asked for an id. the front desk girl (who was nice) asked her manager, and she came out to inform me that i need an arizona license. i just moved from out of state 2 days ago and the manager was rude and told me this info and said it would be $15 day fee and just walked away. i even had my new address in arizona. i have ran and worked at gyms before and this was the worst gym experience i have ever had. they even have an option for one day pass and they still said i still need arizona license. i will probably never be back to this gym. based on the experience i had."
1-star,0,"paying to much money for a gym that's always packed. tried bringing my daughter and they stated she needed an id who brings their id to the gym? i'm paying you money to be here and to be able to bring a guest. find a better gym that's nots packed all day long. equipment is never open, leaving this gym and going somewhere else that's cheaper and less packed. look other places before coming here."
2-star,0,"first, i'd like to start by giving positive feedback on the cleanliness of the facility. most gyms are not very well taken care of. from the bathrooms to the main floor, the gym is picked up and amenities are typically stocked. the cons: the basketball gym; i signed up at this gym because of the full court gym. i often played there 2-3 nights a week. there was a good and loyal base of customers who would use the courts several nights a week, playing for hours at a time. after seeing them section off the full court gym to accommodate functional fitness really turned me off about this gym. if anything, the smarter thing would have been to add more machines, and more free weights. the gym is often extremely packed to where you are waiting on people to finish up on machines and benches. the carpet area is now used primarily used for stretching. the staff; outside of a few people that work the front, aren't friendly. lastly, as minimal as this sounds; the gym is raising pricing on members. it's only a couple bucks in my certain situation but it's principle. lvac in las vegas, is a gym i was loyal to for over 10 years and they honored and grandfathered my price that i signed up with them throughout my tenure. i live in the nw part of peoria, and sadly there isn't another gym close to me. i would not recommend this gym to family or friends, and as soon as there is another gym nearby. i will take my business elsewhere."
1-star,0,"this is easily the most disappointing yelp review i have ever had to write. myself, wife, and 2 kids have been members here at msf for two years. we have referred at least a dozen other friends and couples here who have signed up and are now regulars. one of the greatest appeals that msf had was that it didn't have the generic commercial feel of la fitness or 24 hour fitness. most of the staff knew us by name, and it was a very welcoming place to go. recently things have been changing. the final straw for us came yesterday afternoon when out of the blue we received a email from danielle jarrett, the newly appointed gm of the lake pleasant location, that they would be getting rid of the full basketball court. this was a pretty big blow to us seeing as myself and my 2 sons all play basketball here 3 times a week. it also doesn't take a lot of effort to read through your top yelp reviews and realize that over half of them mention the full basketball court in their review! while the fact that the full court will be gone is disappointing, it's more disappointing that they made this decision without at all considering to see what their members thought. that's not the same msf that we signed up for and definitely not one we want to be a part of... be warned if you are planning on signing up here that some of the amenities they use to draw you in may be gone in no time at all and you will have nothing to say about it."
1-star,0,"i heard that they are closing the basketball full court, wish it was not true. we are disappointed as this is one of the gyms that has full court and consistent games during the week and the only reason some families sign up. if you are planning on signing up for the full court think twice as they will be renovating soon and is going away."
1-star,0,"fastest way to ruin your credit! their collections team has a policy of immediately reporting delinquencies to collections even before they bother to notify you of the deficiency. technically legal, but shady....and is a gym really worth ruining your credit over? no other gym acts this way. sign up at your own risk!"
2-star,0,"the instructors are excellent but have to rate it under three stars due to management. my husband went in three times to cancel his membership and the ""management"" was never available. i still go here but am disappointed with how horrible this place smells! anytime of day or night! the ""filtered"" water tastes disgusting! the staff at the front desk is always chit chatting together and never gives eye contact when customers come in the door. please clean the floors and machines more thoroughly. maybe auto room deodorizers."
5-star,1,"so much fun to work out here! i go early in the mornings and everyone is so nice! the front desk clerk on wed mornings - david, i think - is awesome! so much positive attitude! just puts you in a good mood, right away!! my hubby goes after work and says it's pretty busy with all of the classes going on. so whatever you like....you'll find it here!!"
5-star,1,love this gym! childcare is amazing and justin my personal trainer is awesome. probably one of the best trainers i have ever had. he keeps things really interesting by always switching it up and being creative. he has been a great encouragement on my fitness journey.
5-star,1,"i've been going to this gym on and off for about 5-6 years. i love this place. staff is friendly, clean facility and the members are nice also! classes are great and they have a great support system there too!!!"
1-star,0,"music is way too loud !!! my husband bought me a $200 pair of bose noise canceling headphones and i still hear the music over my own music or tv program. the music doesn't make this gym inviting, it's a huge turn-off. sadly, i don't think i will be renewing my membership."
5-star,1,"you won't regret a membership here. childcare is fantastic and a great feature for a gym. equipment is top of the line. full basketball court. classes are a part of our membership. locker rooms have nice showers, steam room and sauna. this place is killer!"
5-star,1,we mainly keep our membership because of the daycare. if you have kids (specifically babies or toddlers)you have to check this place out. it's worth the extra money. the classes are amazing and the equipment is a huge step up from la fitness. even the bathrooms are amazing. seriously it's awesome :)
5-star,1,my family and i have been coming here for three years. they have childcare which helps us out tremendously when we need to come in and get our fitness on. the place stays pretty cool and the atmosphere is fantabulous it's never been too packed for me to workout here. i love that they updated the drinking fountains with an option to fill your water bottle. very convenient.
5-star,1,"i love this gym! the facility is always clean and nice. the childcare workers are amazing and my daughter just loves it here. i d not know many employees, however,the ones i do know have been so kind and helpful!!! tj, the fitness director is really nice. he was patient and helped me with my goals and getting training set up- i saw blake a few times and- wow- what a workout. and heather was in childcare, now i see her all over- she is such a doll. i highly recommend this gym to anyone!"
4-star,1,child care at this location is great! we love the classes that they offer. my only complaint would be that the classes are sometimes a bit crowded; i wish they'd offer more classes to reduce the sizes of the classes.
5-star,1,"this is a place you can go and do activities to lose weight. or you can bulk up and learn how to bench press cars or crush boulders. i mean the choice is yours. it's dope tho cuz you can like lift weights or do some cardio on the machines. they got a basketball court too but some people be real good like they are trying out for the nba, so i just wait till their done and shoot a bunch of air balls but look good doing it. oh and you can like tan or use their steam room which is cool unless and old guy gets naked then it's just weird. probably don't eat a pizza after you get done working out like i did, but that's just me, i don't conform to societies rules."
5-star,1,"i have been coming to this gym for over a year now. i have lost a total of 125 lbs with the help of my awesome trainer, blake!!! i never feel intimidated or out of place here. i would highly recommend the core concept trainers. they have helped me change my life!!"
5-star,1,"i don't go to mountainside fitness for working out, but i do use their chiropractor there for a long time. never have i walked in the door without the staff giving me a super friendly greeting and being extremely helpful. the place is always super clean, too, with plenty of trainers around to help. i have a great impression of this place from what i've seen."
5-star,1,gotta love mountianside .. i go the surprise one. but been to this one many times. they are very nice and i feel welcomed when i go :)
4-star,1,great gym and awesome kids club. you won't feel bad about leaving your kids in this club while you work out. they even have a bouncey house for the kids
5-star,1,"wow i don't know where to begin. convenient location for us out in the boonies of peoria, beautiful facilities, classes are free, blow dryers in the bathrooms are amazing, tvs everywhere....seriously changed my life. i lost 20 pounds going to this gym. worth every penny."
2-star,0,"i would recommend reading the reviews of the other locations and see how people are promised one thing when they sign up only to have it change when it is time to renew their contract. prices going up over $180 a year after being told their ""price for life"" to being nickel and dimed to use separate pieces of equipment. do research!"
3-star,0,"i been going for 5 years to this location, most class and instructors are good. but not all instructors are good i just say. some are terrible. i used to love to take saturday morning classes with teacher name tea, awesome instructor she always make each class fun and different. but now they replace her with a new teacher name connie, which i really don't understand why is she teaching a class, she make the class a lot more challenge, not everyone is able to do the posture and half of the class is not able to catch up, she may think she is very good, but she definite is not a good teacher. hopefully the owner is able to replace a better teacher then connie."
5-star,1,"this is my favourite yoga studio in the markham/richmond hill area. it started out as a moksha yoga, but i love the improvements that the owners have made since it became my yoga studio. i feel like they kept the best of the facility and great instructors. but they tweaked the format of the classes to enhance the learning experience of the yogis and yoginis looking to advance in their practice. i always feel able to try something new and challenging here. with moksha, you are very limited. i find the yoga instructors here to be very encouraging and supportive for people who want to take their practice to the next level. another thing i like about the classes here is the variation in temperature according to each style of yoga. it's these little attentions to detail that i love."
1-star,0,"a disapointing experience here. after hearing great reviews online i drove to the richmond hill location hoping to try it out only to be turned away with a unsympathetic ""no"" from two kids for being 3 minutes late the to class. i know policy is policy. but businesses don't succeed with poor customer service. by all means this place could be the greatest yoga studio. i simply had a horrible experience."
4-star,1,"signed up for a one month community appreciation program from appreciation events. great deal with a one month unlimited pass and buy one get one ten class pass for $20.99. thus far, i've sampled classes at various times during the day, from 6:30am classes to 8pm classes and found that 4:30 classes is the best time with fewest people ( i think once there were maybe 13-15 people). likely because it's an awkward time for the employed, but i'm taking advantage of my month working from home! the studio itself is well maintained, but a rubber mat is recommended if you're planning on becoming a serious hot yogi to combat slipping on mat during class and focus 100% on your poses. staff are friendly. my favourite classes so far are with bonnie. overall, a warm and rejuvenating environment for you to get away, get toned, and get relaxed."
4-star,1,"recently signed up for the one month unlimited membership to try out all the different classes. the change room (i can only provide comments for the ladies side) and studio room are both generally clean; with exception of one of the sunday vinyasa class at noon where the studio room floor was not mopped (i believe and hope that it was a one off). i also wish that the change rooms would have lockers so that i can store my belongings in a more secure place. i really enjoy the 8pm hot classes as there is less people and works great with my schedule. i find that i can really a great workout while feeling more relaxed. the studio also offers 6pm economy classes for $9, monday, wednesday and friday which makes practicing yoga more economical as we all know how expensive it can get. overall great experience and would recommend anyone interested to practice yoga to try this studio out."
5-star,1,"i have been practicing yoga for about 3 years now and have tried different studios. i almost lost my interest in yoga after about a year in another moksha studio because it was very repetitive and boring. then i bought a passport for prana pass and tried myrh and the rest is history. this studio has kept me going mainly because no 2 classes are the same, even if it's the same teacher. if you like challenges, this is the studio to come to."
5-star,1,"i have been to a few yoga studios... this one has my heart! anyone with a love for yoga and a passion to try to take the practice off the mat.. .this place is for you! awesome teachers, space and community! i have definitely found a studio that deepens my love for yoga every time i take a class."
5-star,1,"i needed a good diversion as i ended my tournament season, recover from injury, and quiet the mind. then, i tried moksha rh since it's so close to my house and one i haven't tried before. i took the introductory offer of $40 unlimited for 30 days last march and i just got hooked to his place. i've been coming regularly since, 3-4x/wk. the #1 reason? teachers. rockstars and angels, they are simply a bunch of outstanding instructors. they're all highly experienced and effective. i just love the way they help us build and understand the foundation for each pose. reminders, tips, queues, personal pose adjustments, philosophy - excellent guidance through the practices. their leadership in each class are just brilliant. i have a list of awesome teachers, and it adds up so often. pm me so i can tell you how they're generally like. i have my faves too! this should help you one way or another. the other reason is spirituality. from my practices years ago, i have learned that yoga is first and foremost a practice for the mind & spirit. and the moksha rh teachers never ignored nor neglected this aspect of the practice. in fact, they emphasize it, which to me is a total coolness factor. found my sanctuary that offers a good variety of classes - another reason to love this place - those i totally dig and absolutely love. the frequency of each class type also helps with my desired number of practices each week with favorable schedules. students vary in levels and personal purpose of doing yoga here. and the teachers are mindful enough to adjust their pace and difficulty level depending on the class that gather at that time. sometimes, there are too many binds and handstands; sometimes mostly stretch, reach, and bends. however it goes, i get my waterfall of sweat and oh-yeah's. so i come to class without expectations, just follow the flow/breath, and focus on what i can do. they also have many relevant workshops every month with experienced and highly esteemed teachers and healers. i love their website. go check it out. the culture of kindness, humility, and politeness without prejudice nor aggression to push you out of your limits are very motivating. i find the students here are practically happy that they can laugh and smile at their own fumble-and-tumble (i'm one of 'em), and kind enough to tell you hey its the left foot not the right with a smile. the teachers make jokes or positive remarks making each class fun yet serious hard work. i've tried almost all classes and scheds except for the weekday early morning of 6:30, and they're all good. some classes can get so packed regardless the time. but it's not always like that. the weather is sometimes a good indication. lol they have a single studio with a maximum capacity of 40 adults, maybe 45 if the mat spacing are adjusted properly. yes, i actually counted like an engineer. i dunno why but it should serve a good purpose in this review. anyway, the heating/ac in the studio is good, love the huge windows and lights in the studio which they adjust according to the intensity of the practice (light affects our state of mind, after all), musing on the calming and earthy interior, sufficient dressing room, and super nice & friendly customer relations. no worries about parking spaces. moksha rh: a sanctuary, a church, a haven, a good place.... there's just so much love in here, man. :d"
4-star,1,"moksha yoga is based on a standard set of poses, this is good for building strength but they offer variety with flow classes and ashtanga. also, some instructors such as todd and heather add in variety and a beautiful flow to the moksha series with different postures. some teachers will invite you to advance or modify poses based on your own comfort within your practise. vikram has a calming and wonderful way of instructing. i signed up with markham but i frequent here a couple of nights a week, i do this for variety and for what fits my schedule. i am very particular about the style of my instructor. i like to be challenged, i want a great sequence of poses and i rely on the instructor for their guidance. the studio is large enough, it's very clean, the change room is notably large for a yoga studio, 4 showers which is impressive. i have never had a feeling of unwelcome, this is yoga! scanning is easy, there's on-line sign up and perk rewards. i would definitely recommend moksha."
5-star,1,"we love this studio. it's not as updated as maple location, but there are 6 showers in the ladies change room, which is greate, as you don't have to wait in line. i love the classes. our favourite is yumee chun's jivamukty classes on friday night and sunday, with live music. these are amasing!!! thanks yumee and moksha!"
1-star,0,i have a girlfriend who is a member at this location and was raving about it so i decided to give it a try since there was a groupon for it. i'm running back to yoga tree! here's what i did not like: 1. no lockers 2. tried 4 different instructors and found them all to be poor. one instructor did not correct anyone. just walked around and talked. another instructor randomly corrected people (two people side by side were doing the exact same thing wrong and only one got corrected) another instructor kept walking all over my mat. there was tons of room (about 15 people in class) and i don't mean they caught the corner walking by. they walked right onto my mat with both feet. several times! i even moved my mat and they still walked on it! why??? the other instructor was so so. i've had better yoga instructors at the gym. 3. location. the location is a nightmare to get in and out of during rush hour. during non rush hour it takes me 10 mins but during rush hour it's more like 30-45 mins! 4. classes are not difficult. these are good if you're a beginner or beginner/intermediate. 5. different class levels are not offered. which would be fine if instructors would give different options. have not experienced this. here's what i did like 1. the showers were nice and big 2. bolsters and cushions available in class 3. lots of parking available
4-star,1,"i've been trying to find a yoga studio that offers a decent amount of ashtanga classes since i can't take the heat (i get ridiculously dizzy which makes me want to curl into a fetal position not a child's pose). richmond hill has 3 classes a week at convenient times so i signed up. during the week is one instructor (eric) and on the weekend it's someone else (i have yet to attend a weekend class...something always comes up!). i haven't done ashtanga for a few months now but eric is pretty good instructing the class and walking around occasionally to correct people's poses. i enjoy them as they're challenging and varies. the studio itself if pretty nice. the changer room is clean and goes by honour system since they don't have lockers yet. i was advised by the front desk that they're coming soon. you can leave your purse with the front desk if you want so it's not an issue. while the change room is small, people are generally good at changing quickly so it has never been an issue for me. looking forward to a weekend ashtanga class..."
3-star,0,"moksha yoga richmond hill is in a building i saw being built back a few years ago when i was still working within the area. i noticed that this is the first yoga studio that has large clear-view windows so everyone outside can see how i do my flippin' downward dog. i noticed the lady next to me was really scared i'll give her a windmill kick in her face instead. she's still alive and eating. :p i guess in case of any emergencies, the fireman from the fire hall a few steps away can always walk over and give anyone here mouth-to-mouth. the interior setting and bench has a lot of drift/natural wood variety elements. the m washroom seemed average as i shared it with myself with 1 washroom and 1 shower area w/2 shower heads. awww, how intimate? the studio space was large and must have fitted the 25+ of us perfectly but anything beyond that would have us kissing feet. the instructor was quite good with all explanations and the emphasis on ""opening up the collar bone"" as today's focus. i guess probably as the lone rookie and non-weekly local, the instructions and transition from pose-to-pose was slightly quicker for me, but perfect for everyone else. she wasn't the ""technical"" type as she commented herself so we did the whole session au-naturel. that didn't mean we were doing yoga nude, it just means we went without any soothing music until the ending sleepy resting pose, my fav."
4-star,1,"moksha yoga richmond hill underwent a major facelit and renovation the waiting area, the change room and the practice room itself all double in spaces! new floorings, new fixture, almost new everything. now the practice room has much better lighting than before, the floor to ceiling windows does let a lot of nature light comes in the room on a nice sunny day. the floor now are wooden panelled flooring. the lady change room now has 4 showers with wooden partitions, 2 hair dryers and 2 sinks! and they also installed a water machine out in the waiting room instead of having the filtered water from the only sink they have previously! disappointment is there still no locker facilities. i also like how they expand their schedules in offering more non moksha series classes! the reduced heat vinysa flow class i attended using my passport to prana was excellent. lynda the instructor was really patient in explaining all the poses and walking around doing adjustments for us! she walked around the whole room and make sure everyone doing the asanas properly!! great energy! great class! there are also complimentary fresh fruits at the receptionist area where you are welcome to have a healthy snack before or after the class. they are still working on putting more finishing touches to the studio. i can't wait to see how it will be when everything is done."
3-star,0,i think the pool and locker rooms could be better maintained. the pool looks like it has a bathtub ring. i find it expensive for seniors who are not on silver sneakers programs. we encourage our elderly to stay active yet make it cost prohibitive for them to join. $45 for a one person senior membership is too high.
4-star,1,"love the instructors and the exercise classes! clean and friendly facility. a bit expensive relative to other clubs. overcrowded at times and in need of more dumbbells and equipment for classes so members don't have to search the entire facility looking for 8 lb. weights, balls, etc. the. new mats are great! comfortable atmosphere; feels like home."
3-star,0,"i love the atmosphere! the staff is helpful and friendly. the equipment is well maintained. however, the staff should make themselves more visible in the equipment area and remind people to wipe off equipment they use with the provided disinfectant. it wastes time for me to wipe equipment down before i use it just to make sure i don't pick up someone else's germs and get sick."
1-star,0,"if you're really into fitness i do not recommend this place. the free weight area is small and the other two areas are always taken with classes or by the staff having a meeting. i actually have pencils that have rougher nurals than the ymca barbells which, by the way, are smooth as butter. the profile picture of this place on yelp is literally the staff having a meeting in one of the two only rooms where you can workout in. i even got kicked out because they were ""closing"". like yeah, i get it was close to the time they close at but guess what. they weren't closed. like i have at least a solid 5 minutes left, hop off. on the holidays they have scavenger hunts with kids running around the entire place with tables of free pizza cookies desserts whatever, you name it. i'm trying to make gains not be tempted into flavorful, tasty good food that will kill me. if you're a gym rat go somewhere else. you don't even have to be a gym rat you can just be someone who's starting get serious about fitness. if you got kids it's a good place to go for the children don't get me wrong. and don't worry, all you'll have to spend is all of their saved-up tuition money because the y has you pay for a membership that costs more than every other gym ever. they won't be able to get good, well-paying jobs, but they sure will have the privilege of getting to say that they paid $50-$60 a month to go to a less than mediocre gym. the ymca is family friendly, not athlete friendly. y, you shall take this one star."
5-star,1,"this is a great gym for families! yes, i can understand how this gym is very expensive compared to other gyms in the area. it is! but, it is geared towards families. if you are not a family or a senior citizen and you're not going to utilize all of the extra curricular activities that they have, but this is probably not the gym for you. it is very expensive even for families but i highly recommend it"
1-star,0,. my son has adhd and was put in summer camp due to some behavioral issues he was kicked out of the program. i was disappointed but understood. i decided to enroll him this year hoping that the ymca would help to teach positive behavior. my son had 1 incident with another child due to movkingl and bullying. my son continued to tell the kids to stop until he was so upset. i do not condone any negative behavior but i don't feel it was up to my son to get the other children to stop. where are the counsellors to immediately diffuse the situation. due to that 1 incident my child was immediately removed from the program permanently. mind you there was no physical harm to anyone. the reason they say he was removed was because of his previous behavior from the year prior. this is extremely disappointing. i believe every child should start every school year with a new slate. i feel as if he started with a target on his back and branded from day 1. my son had no chance from the moment he stepped into camp. such a shame. these are children....
1-star,0,"nice gym, however compared to other gyms in the area it is way too expensive. you can go to fx fitness,dynamic,fitworks, and other gyms for 15-20$ a month. you can go to planet fitness for 10 bucks in parma. the ymca charges close to 50 a month and the only additional feature is really the basketball court and pool.....fx has a pool too for half the price"
1-star,0,"get ready all you nr members, the y has decided to honor the closed ridge road y memberships, nothing against the people from parma its just that this already tightly scheduled facility will be even more packed and overcrowded during peak times. nearby is the ugly, boxy glass county library which used to be a mostly nr facility...it was to have been remodeled and expanded at its former sight, but the mayor wanted his city hall there. now the nr taxpayers subsidize the y building which was a former defunct party center, and through tax dollars maintain the building and service it. the parking there is already a fiasco and will only be worse. when the first opened this y, i called to ask about rates for nr residents and they were very steep. they offered only a small 5 or 10% discount compared to nonresidents and they wanted a credit card or checking for automatic monthly or quarterly withdraws...really? i found a better rate and facilities at the seven hills rec center, because as soon as these community rec centers (albatrosses) run into money-maintenance issues they will slash their non-resident fees, which seven hills did and it was cheaper than the resident fees at nr - family y. brecksville has the best set up, no regionalism nonsense or leases. the community that supports it and subsidizes it are the only ones allowed to use their rec center. they do not offer non-resident membership, nonresidents can only come as one guest of a resident. good luck getting open swim time and bb courts."
2-star,0,"i've been a member at this y for a year now. it's very clean and well kept, but there is much room for improvement. you have to be careful at what time you go there during the summer months because the basketball courts are closed for a kids camp until 4:30 and other workout rooms are closed for meetings some days of the week. this is very frustrating because i am paying a full membership fee to use basically a third of the facility. if you're looking for a family oriented gym then go here but if you want to be able to utilize a variety of aspects of a gym, i wouldn't recommend this place."
1-star,0,came to shoot hoops as a guest with my brother and was only allowed to use a portion of the gym...probably the dumbest rule i've ever heard. either it's an ohio thing or the director of this gym is just str8 up pathetic. if you want a nice gym for you and your guests go somewhere else
3-star,0,"the y is new, clean, and in a very convenient location right near the library. they have a wide variety of exercise equipment, treadmills, and classes available. i do enjoy a good deal of the group workout classes... zumba is always a lot of fun (if you're looking for a great workout, go to one of dana or terryn's classes!) and spinning is a great choice as well! there are definitely regulars in these classes so there's a nice group dynamic going on and it's fun to workout with people you know. it's also great to have a pool in which you can swim laps! as a ""swammer"" (former swimmer), i still like to get in the pool every once in awhile. those are the pros. as far as cons go, i wish there was a bigger variety of class times and types. barre classes are great, but that class has been discontinued. i'd also like to try pilates, hot yoga, and other trendy classes. it's also slightly irritating to go to a class scheduled with one teacher but be surprised with a less-than-desirable one (i have walked out of zumba with alyssa... there's no point to stay in a class where there's no energy!). finally, the pool schedule is so tightly packed, it's hard to find open swim times. overall, the noro y is a great, convenient place to work up a sweat and i'll keep coming back!"
3-star,0,"i've been a member here since it first opened a couple years ago and it's very nice/new/clean, but it is very expensive especially for a y. i'm not sure what classes are free but we signed our 6 month up for water babies class which cost money and was very disappointing. the pool is ice cold and they have no control over the water temperature it seems and that's the only pool. secondly the girls teaching the water babies class were less than enthused about it and seemed more like open swim at times. most of the kids cried bc it was entirely too cold and some had to leave the pool after turning blue. for baby/kids swim lessons i'd highly recommend the swim of things in north royalton, it's definitely their passion and they have a heated indoor pool (but facilities ie changing area is very primitive...sheets hanging on string and they yell at you if you don't take your towel too the pool, kinda odd but they are good at teaching."
5-star,1,"best gym in vegas, super clean, never too crowded, has a shower which makes it really easy to workout in the mornings and then head to work. if you're looking for a friendly and clean gym this is definitely the spot! oh and the staff are great as well! thanks jb, theresa, and ross!"
5-star,1,i've visited alot of gyms and this one is my favorite by far! the owners are so friendly and jb is very knowledgeable when it comes to forming the correct workout to meet your fitness goals! open gym is supplied with plenty of equipment so there is never a wait. one of the best qualities about this gym is it's very clean! i highly recommend this gym to anyone in the area!
5-star,1,great gym with a more intimate setting without the intimidation of having 150 people crammed into a warehouse. simple rates with no gotcha fees.
5-star,1,"if you're looking for a gym in vegas, seriously look no further than open gym fitness! 5 star gym all around! it is an easy, convenient local gym to get to. open 24 hours too! no dealing with crowds like you'd find in any mainstream gym where you're constantly waiting for equipment. even better-extremely affordable for what you receive when you come here!! squat racks, medicine balls, kettlebells, trx bands, olympic lifting platforms, brand new set of turf, free weights and so much more! the gym is also a month to month commitment which is great! the owners, ross and teresa, are amazing people! you'll always see them around the gym chatting with members, giving out support, or even working out with everyone! you can tell they are owners who really care about making everyone's gym experience a great one every single time they walk through those doors. their trainer, jb, is equally as phenomenal!! i've worked out in many different gyms, seen many different trainers, and no one interacts with and truly cares about their clients as much as jb does. ive been apart of the group sessions he coaches monday- friday for about a month now, and i'm hooked! he took the time to learn my goals, and help me with my nutrition. in a little less than a month i've gained 2.2lbs of muscle and lost 4.1lbs of fat with the help of this gym! i could never write enough positive things about this gym- definitely make this gym your top pick!!"
5-star,1,open gym is the ideal gym for anyone ! it's 24 hours & equipped with most of your needs! i hope they open up more !!!!! jb was such a nice guy when looked around there !!!! so knowledgeable & welcoming !!! open gym is my new favorite gym!!!!!
5-star,1,"perfect gym to get in and workout. never packed. like a crossfit gym without the price and always open. seriously check this gym out!!! pros: awesome owners power racks always available two oly stations benches and dumbbells going up to 100lbs two rowers, 3 treadmills, and some other misc cardio equipment sled and area to push inside boxing bag did i mention power racks always available? open 24/7 and never packed. month to month with no commitment and priced very well (cheaper than 24) cons: very few. the only thing i wish they had was a machine for leg extensions/curls, but given the abundance of barbells and price, it's a very small inconvenience."
5-star,1,"what happens when a neighborhood gym evolves into the absolute apex of gym experiences? this. the best gym, you will ever set your mortal eyes upon. thinking about it now i'm not even sure it really exists, it's too perfect, like a stunning mirage in the desert. the gym itself has everything you will ever need to help you lose fat, get strong, and crush whatever your goals have. locally owned and operated, the owners are the friendliest people you'll ever meet and express care towards their members. i'm relatively new to working out so i was a bit nervous a year ago, first coming in. but after coming in, talking to the owners, seeing the gym, and taking a few personal training sessions it really helped kick-start me into the world of fitness and leading a healthier lifestyle. also, you'll get to look ripped, so there's that. there's no contracts and no hidden fees, just an excellent gym. so if you're reading this review and even thinking about it, you're almost there, this is it, the elysian fields, fitness paradise. if you like bad gym's, this isn't for you."
5-star,1,amazing place to get a workout in. i'm a drop in from out of town and needed some open gym time to do my programming. owner was really nice and the place had everything i needed for olympic weight light and i was able to get my crossfit workout on which included the airdyne. i highly recommend this place. pretty cool idea. 24 hour open fitness center that isn't a body building gym.
5-star,1,"i love this place! i was sick of paying crossfit prices and honestly could not make all the scheduled times. i am happy that this place is available to you 24 hours. the equipment is very good quality. i can do oly lifts, power lifts, crossfit and more. very impressed with this place and appreciate the cleanliness and the kindness of the owners."
5-star,1,"how do you know if you'll like ogf? if you answer yes to any of the following questions: 1. are you a nomadic gym traveler, rotating from gym to gym to gym, in search of things unseen? 2. are you into functional fitness? you want to kip your pull ups in peace, push the sled without judgment? slam the med balls, climb your rope, jerk that clean, or curl in the squat rack? 3. do you want to have a photo shoot with a bunch of ropes to bump your instagram follower count without interruption? 4. do you work an odd las vegas hour job, and can't be confined to 10pm closing time of regular gyms? 5. do you hate lvac/24? 6. do you like a help yourself fruit bowl? 7. do you want a platform so you can chase your olympic dreams in rio de janerio however unlikely the outcome? 8. do you like mom and pop businesses? 9. do you like to work out in an almost empty almost all the time gym? sign ogf like i did at $34.95 month to month with no start up fees or termination fees. see you there (or never)."
5-star,1,"nice cozy gym with all the bells and whistles! the owners are very friendly, helpful, and receptive. no contracts, no hidden fees, and everything a gym should be. in the words of peyton manning, ""i like it""."
5-star,1,awesome gym. great staff. great environment. no hidden fees or contracts. good for beginners up to advanced training. very clean and well maintained equipment.
5-star,1,"my wife and i have been working out at open gym for a few weeks now and we always feel welcome at the facility. the equipment, which is always clean, is brand new and top notch. the owners ross and teresa are such friendly people and they really know how to make you feel comfortable when you walk through their doors. you definitely won't feel like you're ""just another member"" at this gym. the environment is much different than lvac and other big gyms. i'd highly recommend 1-on-1 training with ross because his attention to detail is superb and he breaks things down in a very effective and easy to understand manner. we joined because of the fair prices and convenience (5 mins from home), but we soon learned there are plenty more reasons to sign-up. you won't regret it."
5-star,1,"great teachers and classes! always friendly and helpful. haven't tried any other otf in the phoenix area, only in norcal."
5-star,1,"i have been a member of orange theory fitness for 7 years now and still love every minute of it! after 7 years and i still have not had the same workout twice. i love that there is a new workout and new challenge every day. i started attending the scottsdale location which was the first in the state of arizona back in 2011. all in all, i have attended 10+ different studios across the valley as well as others out of state. camelback and their sister studios (central phoenix and arcadia) are great! the desk staff is super friendly and helpful, especially maddie at the camelback location. i was having issues with my heart monitor for a while and other studios (i tend to pop around a lot) were helpful in giving me a loaner for the class, but it did not resolve the issue. it was only a temporary fix. maddie went above and beyond and spent time troubleshooting with my heart monitor and charger while i was in class until she figured out a solution for me. top notch customer service! #ibleedorange"
5-star,1,"first workout!! i feel like jello, but can't wait to go back!! everyone was so nice and friendly and willing to work around my physical limitations!"
5-star,1,"otf has changed my life in ways i can't explain. at 48 years old, i have never been athletic, hated running, and was putting on more and more weight. in the five months i've been attending orangetheory, i've lost 30 pounds, i feel better than i've ever felt in my life, i'm happier, my friends are noticing a difference, i am actually starting to sign up for competitive runs and obstacle course races. i can't even begin to thank this amazing company for the things they've done for my life! do yourself a favor and check it out!"
1-star,0,"honestly, the workout is great but the policies and front desk staff made this a bad experience. i'm a member that brought my boyfriend in to try a class and 30 minutes before they started texting him saying he was too late to start and that he could come back a different day. we ended up getting there 15 minutes before and they said he could not do the class for ""safety reasons."" sorry, but it takes 2 minutes for the instructor to walk you through class and 5 minutes to fill out the paperwork (which ended up being their safety excuse). like i said, great workout but for the cost of membership im really frustrated by the customer service. there is a new location opening up that i signed up for and am just using this location temporarily and i hope the other one opens soon."
5-star,1,"the instructors and all staff are awesome. they take the time to discuss your fitness goals and learn your name. even as a previous college athlete, i am being pushed harder than i have been in a while!"
5-star,1,"this was my first time visiting this location. i usually go to the one downtown since it's close to work. the facility is pretty awesome, looks and feels bigger than the downtown location. their quiptment looked pretty new too. my workout was with nic,he was great! hands on, very motivating. front desk staff were super friendly and helpful."
5-star,1,"this ot is by far my favorite of the 3 in my neighborhood. the coaching staff is phenomenal, the front desk staff is amazingly friendly and the equipment, lobby and bathrooms are super clean. i used to dread going to the gym and now, i have to force myself to take a rest day! every workout is challenging in different ways and after four months of attending, i'm faster, leaner and stronger than i was, or would ever be working out on my own. if you haven't tried otf yet, check them out, you'll be hooked!"
5-star,1,visited this location for the first time while the arcadia location moves and i must say i really love this location! jenny was absolutely amazing! i'm even thinking about driving the extra bit just to attend her classes each week even when my new location opens! thanks for the awesome class!!!
5-star,1,"the trainers are so knowledgable and very motivating. they are extremely friendly and fun. my form has been corrected several times, its like having a personal trainer. my fitness level has definitely improved and i've been able to adjust my workout accordingly. they have a very accommodating schedule. i always feel accomplished when i'm done."
5-star,1,"the workouts can be challenging. but, it's all at your own pace. so although they encourage everyone to give their 100% effort, that will look different from person to person. i was hesitant to try it at first but it's by far the most effective workouts i've done. there is no way i would push myself as hard as i do if i was just on my own. they check in on you throughout and make sure you're comfortable and effective. i also love that you can see real time how many calories you're burning and how accurate it is. this location is my favorite one because they are open later than some other locations which gives me more class options to attend. pros: great workout, helpful staff, extended hours, clean cons: may be a bit pricey for some people"
5-star,1,"it's the best workout, and the only one i've ever been able to stick with. i've tried so many different workouts over the years, and i end up losing interest. orangetheory always mixes it up to keep things interesting, and you can never plateau since it adjusts based on your current fitness level."
5-star,1,love love love otf! i've been an active member for nearly 4 years. it was my first time visiting this studio. i had a great workout with trainer kristi! she keeps the class motivated and moving! i would highly recommend this studio and of course a workout with kristi!
1-star,0,worst ever!!! my 13 year old kid could run that place better! i've tried to cancel my membership for 3 months now and they keep charging me! i don't understand what's so hard about cancelling a membership when i provided the necessary forms after someone told me over the phone before all this that i didn't need to do anything!!
5-star,1,"i was referred to orange theory by a friend. i decided to take the free trial class and was immediately hooked. i love the fact that the staff is so positive and truly motivating. i finished my class expecting to be bombarded with a sales pitch and nope, the girl at the front desk asked if i had any questions about the session or memberships...totally casual. i loved that!!! it was nice not being hounded to buy a membership like other gyms. it's nice because with the membership, you can go to other locations. i definitely recommend ot ashley and kristi are awesome!!!"
5-star,1,"i was sick of my general workout routine and needed to change it up. so many people have told me about orange theory, and i'm glad i finally tried it! i'm hooked!! love this location and the trainers are amazing. always a great workout!"
5-star,1,i love this location! everyone is so friendly and welcoming. it is by far the best one hour workout you can have! every trainer that trains here it's awesome and definitely knows what they are doing! go orange!
1-star,0,"if i could give zero stars then i would but since i can here's the deal. i signed up for the trial and after reassessing my monthly budget, cancelled. i was then charged $164 after already canceling. my money was refunded after a couple phone calls and i was then told that the 'system' created two accounts for me and where one was cancelled the other remained active and that is why i was still charged. weird, but okay, i got my money back and didn't think of it since. until this past thursday 8/25 when looking at my bank account online i see a charge from oranetheory fitness for $79! what! so i call and am assured that the manager will take care of it. so i call back the next day to address the status on the refund and the manager has not seen the note yet but am assured again that it will be taken care of. so i call the next day and get the voice mail and no one called me back. you better believe i will be calling again, if not showing up and demanding this be resolved. for such a seasoned company you would think they would have issues like this taken care of asap. obviously not. i have worked with other ot locations in the past and have never had issues. this location needs help."
5-star,1,"this is my 'home' otf. it is brand new and just opened in july. today, after vacationing and eating all around the world.. i finally showed up for my beating. i have now worked out at a few otf places in the valley, my most frequent is central, where i got hooked by amazing emily. i was sad when emily left for florida, but she's moving up in the otf world. i had a few minor issues at central, mainly with being told one thing regarding my daughter and a temporary membership, ( there are no contracts at otf and that is the amazing thing about them.. ) and the pod/wrist band usage. not a reason to get mad and give up what works for my body and is fun, though! keep pushing! fast forward and we are here at camelback colonnade! it's new and shiny and our trainer, richard, was amazing, encouraging and awesome! he may be on point with emily ... as he made my daughter and i feel welcome here and guided us along. we aren't rookies to otf, but no one would know that today... as i've mentioned in my other review for otf central, this isn't for pansies ! this workout will work you and work you good! you get cardio in blocks on the treadmill with running or power walking .. move to rowers .. move to the weight room and in an hour that goes pretty quick, mind you, you have burned 500-600 calories and later ... your heart will thank you! the treadmills here at this location have fans... ahhh! i love that, as i've been to the others and getting the treadmill in the 'right' area where the ac or fans from above hit you .. becomes key! no need to worry here at camelback colonnade! this place is clean and the front desk staff is nice too... that again, isn't necessarily the case all the time at other locations. if you haven't had your dose of citrus yet .. try it. make your fat scream!"
4-star,1,"i will always and forever encourage people to try orangetheory! it's a tough workout, do not get me wrong, but it's one of the best out there. i travel a lot so i really appreciate that i'm able to go to different locations but still get great consistency! coaches here at otfsc are incredible! i take early morning classes and michelle is always encouraging us to bring our best to our workout and leave being the best humans we can be. ""be kind to one another"" it's just the perfect way to start your day! if you've been thinking about trying out otf- go for it!"
1-star,0,"pretty unprofessional staff, particularly upper management. they seemed okay at first but the more interactions i had with them the more i realize that the company hires really unqualified people who aren't able to do anything except sell. i definitely will never go back to otf at any location due to their complete unprofessionalism."
5-star,1,"yup, it's real. all the hype, all the radio promos, friends talking about it, it's legit. second workout done and love everything about it. we were very intimidated as we haven't worked out in so long but that wasn't an issue once the class started. it's the real deal, go check it out!"
5-star,1,"the trainers (kenpo, michelle, kyle, sunny, rob), the interval training variety, the music, the energy of a crowded class of people working hard!!"
5-star,1,"i love everything about orangetheory! from the moment i walk in the door, i know i am going to have a great workout. every trainer there motivates me to push harder. nothing else compares!"
5-star,1,i like having a leader to direct me through the routines. i also like the fact you are never waiting for a machine. the hour is maximized so i get the most benefit of my time spent exercising.
5-star,1,"very clean, upbeat, fun and organized! love it! the price is a little high but it's worth it when you see your results as they are happening."
5-star,1,"i have been attending this location for almost 4 months. the girls at the front desk are always super friendly and helpful. i have attended almost all of the coach's classes and even though they all have a different style, they are always willing to help with form and technique. love this place!!!"
5-star,1,awesome trainers and staff who are committed to helping you enjoy your workout experience and reach your goals. member for 1 year. best workout!
3-star,0,"workout lasted 48 minutes, not 60. the guy leading our workout never corrected our form once (which i'm sure our form was wrong since we were new) and ignored me when i tried to get his attention to ask a question. he never asked how we were doing or if we had any questions. he had a gut and was out of shape. he had a pompous attitude and i'm not even quite sure he knew how to do the exercises correctly because when he ""demonstrated"" the lunges his knee was extended way over his toe. otf is a great workout. they just need to make sure all their instructors are up to par. i'm going to another location this weekend and hoping for a more down to earth instructor who isn't lazy with an attitude."
5-star,1,"love otf....great workouts and trainers! kyle is especially amazing always positive and ready to go at 5am! thanks for training at otf kyle, boom!"
5-star,1,"i have worked out for years and there is nothing quite like orange theory fitness. i tried it out as a skeptic and it is now my new addiction. . my fitness level improvements are incredible. if you are bored with your typical workout, you need to give this a try."
5-star,1,"amazing! that is how i feel after every workout. the trainers are motivating, the workouts vary daily so you don't get bored, and the staff is great. love that the trainers make sure your workout is at your level, but keep you challenged. going to otf is my favorite part of my day!! i love this place!!"
5-star,1,"orange theory is by far the best fitness training i have ever had. i was in decent shape before i joined but i had some goals to meet before i turn 40. i just couldn't seem to get that toning and tightening i was looking for. then i started orange and i am in the best shape i have ever been in in my life. the chandler heights / gilbert location has amazing trainers. they keep me motivated and i look forward to my workout with them. it is a challenging workout but if you listen to your trainers you can achieve those goals that you never thought you would. thank you tasha, spencer, and sonny. i'm gonna rock my 40th birthday!!!"
5-star,1,"absolutely the best workout i've ever had!!! i've been attending now for almost a year and i've seen amazing results. i had already worked with my trainer champ in the past and lost a total of 85 lbs but he took me to the next level when he convinced me to join otf. i lost another 5 lbs and an entire dress size. i'm in the best shape of my life and i owe it all to him and his staff at orangetheory. if your looking for real results, this is the place!"
5-star,1,"wonderful workout. always different. staff is great, helpful, and caters to your specific needs. not only is the workout all encompassing, but the encouragement during makes me want to come back again. going to a gym would not have given me that encouragement. none of the workout is intimidating, only encouraging."
5-star,1,fantastic workout. never the same workout time after time. the trainers are wonderful and will help you modify if you need it. no excuse not to at least try it.
5-star,1,"i love this gym! you get the feeling (and attention) of personal training in a room of 20 or so people working out. everyone who works here or works out along side you here is encouraging, motivating, and friendly! max and stephanie create a warm, welcoming environment and the staff are so helpful! and the coaches are knowledgeable and attentive."
5-star,1,"i've been a member since june. i have slimmed down, gotten a lot stronger, improved my balance, & learned so much about myself! i'm definitely a lot more competitive than i realized. this is the new 'cheers' where everyone knows your name! the staff, coaches, and members are all so friendly and welcoming. everyday is a new workout...you never know what you are going to be doing and i have never repeated the same workout! otf is definitely family and a really great addiction. they always have fun additional things to do for extra challenges, personal bests, or just plain fun! the price is definitely worth the amount of health & personalized attention you get!!! so worth every penny & all of my love!!! otf"
5-star,1,"took a free trial class this weekend and signed up for an unlimited membership. i really appreciate the friendly and kind staff, and stephanie has been my favorite trainer so far. hours are perfect for my work schedule and i love the weekend hours as well. i would like to update with a few more things that i love about orange theory: (1) class size is limited. ensures that everyone has enough space. (2) the apps that keep track of your classes and monitor your progress are fab! i love apps. (3) trainer directed class. it's like having a personal trainer. you just listen and go! (4) every class is different. (5) nearly impossible to slack off and not have a great workout."
5-star,1,"orange theory, or otf that we fondly refer to it as is by far the best workout you'll ever have. i don't care how disciplined you are at the big gyms or at home, this is totally different. wearing a heart rate monitor, you track your calorie burning zones and can see when you aren't working hard enough. the coaches motivate you and push you but not in a boot camp way. it's like having your own personal trainer and biggest fan! my body has changed in ways i never imagined in only 6 months and i also gained a new family. it's not easy but you see results and that is the best motivation to get yourself out of bed each day and workout for one hour. come join us at this location, don't think about it any longer!! come see what it's all about!"
5-star,1,"i absolutely love being a member here and being a part of the otf family. the staff is so friendly and welcoming and the coaches are amazing. they are very helpful and will also push you to do your best. the workouts are great and are never the same. i do the workouts at my fitness level and never feel intimidated by others who are more advanced. i'm so happy i took that first free class to check it out. after that, i was hooked! my daughter calls orangetheory fitness her ""happy place"" and i totally agree!"
5-star,1,"this is the best workout i've ever gotten! i've tried many fitness places and gyms, and nothing beats this one! every class is different and the workouts are never the same. you are constantly pushing your body to change and do something different. the staff is amazing and has become like family. they are always encouraging you to do better. this place has changed my fitness and my life! love my otf family #nicolenotjenna"
5-star,1,"love love love! this is the best workout ever! i've never been able to be in such good shape as i am today and eat so many goodies without feeling any guilt! there's no routine in the workouts (i know because i go 5x a week), the coaches are amazing and you are guaranteed to get results! if you love hard core workouts, this is definitely for you! ???"
5-star,1,"love, love, love this place. where else can you go and burn a calorie a minute? i've lost 80lbs this year and otf has been a huge part of my success. the trainers are knowledgeable and attentive. they definitely keep you honest with your form. the reminder that you're supposed to push to where you're a little uncomfortable helps me in those moments when i want to quit. the front desk crew is also so nice and helpful, i feel like i'm visiting with friends prior to my workout. puts me in a good frame of mind for the tough workout ahead. i think the price is right too. i was working with a personal trainer and paying a fortune. otf is much more reasonable and i feel like i'm still getting 1:1 training. i definitely recommend!"
5-star,1,"i visit from out of town for the holidays often and decided to try out this location and i was not disappointed! they were so nice and very accommodating. they truly made it a positive experience for me, and i have never felt so welcomed at a gym. max and marcus were awesome!"
5-star,1,"0500 monday's and wednesday's!!! i love steph and vivian, they both are amazing coaches. there is no wrong question-there is always great support."
5-star,1,"just when you are feeling fit, it pushes you to be the best you can be! love the motivation stephanie brings, the strength and encouragement vivian brings and the staff are awesome!"
5-star,1,"i absolutely love this place! i actually look forward to going and i burn at least 600 calories in an hour! the music is fun, the coaches are incredibly helpful and encouraging and i've even met some new friends. i feel like i have a personal coach! all the equipment is clean (we clean after every use) and after just 6 weeks i can see a difference in my body! totally worth the money!!"
5-star,1,"orange theory fitness is basically a barry's bootcamp except better because you actually wear a heart rate monitor to track your heart rate and calories burned during each class. it's half cardio (treadmill/water rowers) and half weights (free weights, trx, bosu) for 55 mins alternating usually half way through the class. i only have pros: *the otf app is super user friendly! you are able to sign up for classes in advance and it totally holds me accountable (they do charge you without an 8 hour notice) you can also book at other gyms from the app *after every class you are emailed your stats from the class which keeps track of your weekly, monthly and yearly calories *because it's a franchise with the unlimited monthly membership i can visit any other gym in the city (not sure about other cities, there might be some sort of fee) *your first class is free, and they loan you a heart rate monitor for the duration of the class *they offer late classes (7pm) and some of the locations do a 90 min class *there is no intimidation-every class is filled with all ages and fitness levels bottom line....i wish i would've found this place sooner...... like 10 years ago sooner......"
2-star,0,"cancelled my membership because it's too hard to get into the classes that fit my schedule. the morning classes are almost always on a waitlist if you don't reserve a spot 1+ weeks in advance. i was on the 4 classes / month plan, and otf didn't let me roll over classes when i couldn't fit 4 into the month because their classes were full. so, basically, they were making me pay $60 a month to sit on their class waiting lists. because their technology doesn't let you book classes past your monthly billing date, i wasn't allowed to book classes further in advance."
5-star,1,the best workout i have ever found! full body and comprehensive. awesome coaches with great energy. they correct your form and as they get to know you they push and encourage. love it here!
5-star,1,"i love starting my day with ot! the variety of the workouts is great- strength training combined with cardio keeps me from getting bored with my daily workout routine. the coaches are great, they ensure you are doing the movements properly and push you to bring your best self to each class!"
5-star,1,i like that the coaches get to know you and they push you to work harder than you think you can. it's the motivation and the continued results that i see that keeps me coming back. and the staff is great.
5-star,1,"i only have 3 workouts in so far but it's a good environment. friendly staff and fellow attendees. space and equipment are very clean. i was nervous that it would be intense but the way it's set up, you can push yourself at the pace you choose. it's helpful to have the heart rate monitor to gauge how hard you are truly pushing yourself. lots of different workouts using weights, bosu balls, treadmill, rowers and trx bands."
5-star,1,"tough but adaptable work out. if you, like me, try to stay in shape despite many other obligations and worry about muscle loss, but cant get out of the work out rut, this is great exercise class. basically you rotate between treadmill, rower and resistance weight training. it is a little confusing at first but they direct you. if you dont run you can power walk. the work outs are hard but you feel great after. after3 workouts so far i am sore next day but functional. my level of fitness before is jog 2-3 miles/weights once weekly with skiing/hiking/biking on side. i have to be careful of my wrists and not too bad although there were some things i just didnt do-they will offer you modifications if have injury. in my classes in the burbs there has been wide array of people from middle aged couples, work out freaks and many others. you dont have to worry about fitting in and you can go at your own pace. in order to truly participate u need a monitor ($99! arm). they have a variety of options/memberships and as i work a lot did the one where i buy a certain number of classes vs membership as i work a lot dont want hassle/frustration of keeping up with membership. at my site they were thankfully not to pushy about membership etc. they offer wide array of times even 5 am classes. bottom line not cheap, but i am excited to have this new way to push myself."
5-star,1,"a great way to spend an hour! trainers are enthusiastic and committed to making us all better. workouts are different everyday, i always leave feeling like i had an amazing workout. try it!!"
5-star,1,"the class size was just right. clean, welcoming environment. the trainer (mandy) was awesome. all of the staff were very supportive and helpful."
5-star,1,ot challenges me to try different exercises. the staff is welcoming and committed to helping me reach my goals. in less then a month i have hit not one but two of my goals. ot has allowed me to tap into my inner strength and self love. everything has improved because i decided to try one class of ot. thank you for the support!!! xoxo
5-star,1,"i had a resurfacing facial at mandara. i regularly get facials and like to always try new spas. i have to say this was the best facial i have ever had. the service was impeccable, the esthetician was gentle and informative. the treatment was very thorough and exceptionally relaxing. this is also the first time i eagerly have wanted to buy products after a treatment. i travel to vegas for work several times a year and will come back to mandara 100%. note: the facilities could use an renovation -- however this in no way impacted the quality of my treatment."
1-star,0,"i had an experience recently in las vegas that i need to tell you all about. i was recently invited to play a baccarat tournament at paris las vegas, which is owned by caesars entertainment corporation. i made an appointment for an 80-minute massage on december 17 at their spa, the paris spa by mandara. my appointment was for 1 pm and i arrived at 12:45 pm. an attendant gave me a locker, along with a wristband and a key. inside the locker, i left a gold necklace, a gold rolex watch, a money clip with $543 dollars, and $500 in playing chips. after my massage, i went to retrieve my belongings, but my gold watch and $500 from my money clip were missing. i immediately notified the staff at the front desk of the spa. we went back to my locker to search, but had no luck. i asked them about the attendant who gave me the locker, key and wristband, but was told he had left for the day. they insisted that i must have left my watch and money somewhere else. i asked them to call security so they could help me, since the spa was of little help. security took down my statement. since i was frustrated that no one seemed to be able to help me, security advised me to call the las vegas police department. i called them and they came to take down my report. i was advised to call risk management, since they were in charge of such matters. i have left numerous messages, but no one has contacted me yet. i called security to find out the status of the investigation and they referred me back to risk management again. at this point, i feel like i have to hire a lawyer to help me with my case, but would rather not. all i want is a complete investigation and my watch and money back. since the last thing any las vegas casino wants is publicity showing they aren't secure and that they don't protect their guests and their property, the best option i have is to spread the word until they conduct a full investigation. so please like and share this post anywhere and everywhere until they address the matter of my stolen watch and money."
2-star,0,"this is the type of spa set up to relax and spend time enjoying. i just went in for a brazilian wax and left immediately, so i can't speak to the other aspects of the spa. the staff was nice enough, and my technician was courteous. she made it as painless as possible, but the end result was sub par. she missed a significant amount of hair, including patches in some places. all for more than double the normal price plus a mandatory 20% gratuity. i would not recommend."
1-star,0,"heed my warning. this place needs to be shut down by the health department. front desk was rude. groupon did not disclose a 25% additional gratuity fee. during the massage my wife had to pay $15 extra for a ""deep tissue"" because the therapist was literally doing nothing but lightly touching her. jacuzzi is disgusting. showers are filthy. maintenance staff was literally just watching tv. groupon issued refund."
1-star,0,"not impressed. i would expect when you pay for a 75 minute massage, you would actually get 75 min. therapist was 10 minutes late for the appointment to start with. not sure what she was fumbling with during the massage but it wasn't relaxing in the least bit."
1-star,0,"i went into the spa this morning to access the gym, prior to attending my more in conference. i waited behind a gentleman very attentively to know the protocol as this was my first visit. i approached after he finished and when i told the customer servicer representative my room number, she stated, ""do you har your id?"" i said, ""no."" she replied saying, ""i'm sorry you'll have to have your id to be certain that your a guest of the hotel."" i simply laughed and went back upstairs to get my id. i have no issue going back to get my id; however, if there is a policy in place, it should be universal for all customers. i will cotinue to go, as i am here for a week, but this is unacceptable. yes, i spoke with hotel management, but i'm uncertain, what, if anything will be done!"
3-star,0,"i booked a massage, hot stone and deep tissue and the next day, a fire and ice manicure and pedicure. the massage was out of this world. i had a wonderful massage with a skilled masseuse who got to knots easily and made me feel comfortable. she was on time and got me from the spa in my robe. she led me to a private room and told me everything she was going to do. her name was melissa. i think it was one of my best massages ever. it was worth every penny. i used a groupon and added on deep tissue and more time. a very rewarding experience. the next day i got a manicure and pedicure which was not worth it. i was amazed i paid $222 for both and the person was almost clueless about what she was doing. she was an older lady who wasted time just walking back and forth while my feet were in the water. i should have complained about it and not paid for it. i get a better manicure and pedicure at my local salon where i live. i heard about the bellagio offering awesome mani and pedi's and paris offered the same service, but not what i expected! it was so disappointing to a t!!!!!"
1-star,0,"wow. for las vegas, for a world famous hotel, for $300+ a person, this is so incredibly horrible, that its baffling that this hasn't been shut down already!!!! spending a few nights in vegas on a roadtrip. my husband and i were desperately in need of some relaxation. i finally got the head nod yes, so i booked him an appointment as well. i added on the hot stones for good measure. this of course killed me once the overly chatty and over compensating front desk girl checks us out, and mentions the close to $700 tab plus the added gratuity!?!? omg, reminder of the pure disappointment i had just lived through. btw they do not mention the added gratuity at check in!! i get to the spa in time to get my "" sauna and cuzz on"". i walk in to an empty, non staffed lounge. i walk around, check it out.. then walk back out to the front. wait, then this young lady pops out from the office. she checks me in and shows me around. i get my locker. i get undressed. i go to take a rinse off shower. hair, everywhere. on the walls, on the floors, i feel it starting to grow on me! i then brave it up and head over to the mini, i mean mini, jacuzzi. the walls in this area are covered in grime, the mural or whatever that is, is from 900 years ago. i go into the steam room. it smells, it smells like filth, musk, just heavy air. they claim its the ""eucalyptus room."" no. the tiles in the steam room are holding on for dear life, the ground is covered in, you know it- hair. moving into the sauna. that was the cleanest part, and still nothing i would bring my mother to. after my massage, i went to put my clothes back on. then i noticed the disgusting carpet floor in the locker room. covered in stains and, hair. i overheard the ""spa check in"" lady talking to another staff member about how she wasn't feeling well. there is no professionalism. dirty, disgusting, ripoff. i spend a lot of time going to the ymca, as well as getting massages at burke williams etc. i am no prissy snob, but i know where people feel comfortable getting naked. this is not a place for that. i will never ever ever be back. it is a huge rip off. the massage lacked the main thing i told her i needed work on. this place is just out for your money $$$$$$$ they know you are just passing through. they have no work ethic and are incredibly fitly."
1-star,0,"will not go back! i tried to cancel massage appt that was made for me by a friend. i was 30 mins. past their cancellation time and they would not cancel appoint. i understand that is policy (even if i didn't know it) but the customer service was atrocious! the person on the other line was a rude and had an attitude.. ""well that is our policy and there's nothing i can do about it."" if you're in customer service you don't have an attitude with your customer. there's also a way to say things to diffuse the situation. she just made me more agitated. she could have been more sympathetic and say i'm sorry wish there was something i could do... so, i try to make the best of the situation and figured i'll go and try to relax. the experience doesnt get better! i get to the front desk to check in. then she tells me that i'm booked for 75 minutes instead of 50. that's another $80+ for a service i didn't want to begin with. my friend that made the reservation changed the service to 50 mins from 75 immediately after she made the appointment and even had the ladies name who she spoke with. this person was conveniently not there the day we checked in and she made no notes. again, no let me see what i can do. or no sincere apology. it was more like, well im sorry but i dont have any notes that you changed your service (said with a stern attitude). she was more accusational like well if you called then there would be a note. as if her people dont make mistakes. so i try to make the most out of the situation again. but the massage was ok. it wasn't bad but it wasn't the best either. i go a couple of times a year and i usually always leave feeling very relaxed. that was not the case this time. the therapist was also unprofessional and just kept talking in the beginning so i couldn't even relax at first. he commented on my tattoo saying that i must be a rebel. he talked about what he wanted to do as a side job. when i talked about being in vegas with my husband he said ""oh, so you have to be a good girl"". i didn't know how to respond to any of that so i just tried to answer in one word when he'd ask me a question. he eventually stopped talking and i eventually relaxed a little... and then came the hot stones that he placed on my body. one was directly over my bladder. it made me have to go to the bathroom. talk about killing the relaxing vibe. needless to say, if you are looking for great front desk customer service and an amazing massage, save a few bucks and go somewhere else. oh and did i mention the required 20% tip that no one mentioned when you check in? you can't even tip according to how you felt the service went. yeah, that was another great surprise. i paid $280 for the worst spa experience i've ever had :-("
4-star,1,"ok spa, ok massage- hubby & i took advantage for the massage special when we checked in. hubby said his massage was great- he didn't take advantage to the steam-room or showers. i had a good massage with the most talkative masseuse ever. i was looking forward to a big ""unwind"" but instead i got a great massage, but i now know which muscles are causing me issues & what to do to help me keep from knotting up so it was educational...lol all in all for the bargain price they gave me it was worth it. i took advantage of the steam room, the sauna and the whirlpools and the showers. not the most amazing spa but it was nice for i found the pricing fair & the facility nice."
1-star,0,"this is not a review of the spa services and quality but rather costumer service and unreasonable pricing. my husband and i bought 2 vouchers for a massage from groupon. when i called to make an appointment, i requested if we could be in the same room for our message. the receptionist said that it would be an additional $197 charge because couple's massages are ""a la carte"". what? it's the same service! on top of that, they will charge a 20% service fee, which will come to another $100. so not worth it. spend your money on a show instead."
2-star,0,"i have always stayed at the paris hotel and have enjoyed the spa on several occasions. this last time was extremely strange to say the least. i had a great massage therapist until she sat down above my head to massage my shoulder and neck. during this time she continued to fall asleep and nod off and on. i even opened my eyes to see what was happening and noticed her nodding off. maybe there was a legitimate reason why she was so tired but i did not consider it professional at all, especially when you pay their prices. i spoke to the lady at the front desk about it and she stated she would look into it and call me that day. i never received a call or any explanation for them for ignoring my concern. extremely disappointing!!!"
5-star,1,"no clue why there are so many negative reviews since my time here was amazing. i went on a groupon and had the body wrap treatment, facial, massage. i felt incredibly pampered. the facility was nice and clean. the aesthetician gave me the best facial (and i've had many facials in nyc)."
1-star,0,"while i am only estimating by the fact that i was back dressed and ready to go a good 20 minutes before my friend who also getting a ""50 minute massage"" i figure i got about 35. during which i was talked to about my tattoos constantly, and he even made a comment about the 'natural breasts' on one of my tattoos! i had to tell him about 5 times it was too much pressure. they automatically add 20% tip to the already overpriced service (hello las vegas), so if you have a not-so-great experience you can't even tip them accordingly. which is why i suspect they do that, and why i have had not one but two mediocre (at best) massages. they know they are going to get a 20% tip regardless of their service. i stay at the paris every year, and while i will likely stay there again next year, i will find another spa for massages."
1-star,0,"stayed at the hotel for 3 nights and needed at least one decent workout. the workout room felt like an afterthought. a dingy underused conference room that had some machines thrown in to create a gym. none of the equipment was well maintained, and there was insufficient equipment for a good workout. i'd rather stay at the venetian complex and get the canyon ranch spa gym there. now that's a real gym!"
1-star,0,"my boyfriend and i celebrated our two year anniversary this weekend and i decided (although last minute) to book a massage for the both of us. i called the spa and left a message to see if they had appointments. nobody called me back. i called again and finally spoke to someone. i let the guy know that i was holding off on purchasing a couple groupons until i confirmed they had available appointments. he booked our appointments for 12pm and let me know that check in time was at 11:30am. we arrived at about 11:45am and were told that we needed to have our tickets printed (guy never told me this!).....after haggling with the front desk lady for a few minutes they let me know that i could email the tickets to them...well there is no reception there so i couldn't.....then they told me that because i was 30 minutes late that time would be shaved off our massage...which was ridiculous because check in time is different than my actual appointment time! i thought it was really tacky to say that to someone especially when that was not communicated when i scheduled the appointment. they eventually rushed us in, printed our tickets and didnt shave the time off our massage...the massage was good but your service was pretty unwelcoming and lacked professionalism. would never recommend this place..."
1-star,0,"went in for a men's haircut. $50.00 + mandatory $10.00 tip. i expected, at least, a highness top notch haircut.....instead it looked like edward scissor hands cut it. one side was cut at least an inch above the ear and the other side actually went over the ear. horrible job. i asked for another stylist but guess what....the one the hacked it is the only one there for the next two days. so yes, i get to spend my time in vegas with a complete disaster of a haircut. i am giving this a ""one star"" because the staff was nice and respectful to my complaints and they did reimburse me."
4-star,1,"i have no idea why the reviews on here are so bad. i only went to the gym, not the spa, but i found it to be just fine. a 5 day pass to the gym was $100 (they have single day passes and a 3 day pass too). it was a little pricey but well worth it for a gym located just a few floors down from my room and considering all the buffet eating i did. the gym is pretty big with cardio and weigh training equipment in abundance. of all the times i was there i only saw a handful of other folks. it's private and quiet. the equipment is clean and in good repair. in fact, i didn't see anything at all broken in the gym. there are several tvs, towels, a water cooler. all the comforts of a regular gym. my 4g coverage was fine in the gym, despite not having any windows or anything, so i could listen to spotify for music if i wanted. the locker rooms are extremely nice, being part of the spa. the staff is very friendly. all in all, a great experience!"
4-star,1,great spa for a free usage through my diamond card. they have cans of tree top apple juice. the gym is nice and i like the robes
2-star,0,"this review is for the salon only. this place is a dump! they charge as much as the nice places. go to one of the nice ones. very dingy, dated salon. poor lighting. pushy about upselling and products. mediocre blow-out for $110. go get a good one at bellagio, mgm, or venetian/palazzo for the same price. mgm will even give you a glass of champagne, and you won't feel like you're in your grandmother's shampoo/set place from the 60s."
1-star,0,"hi i was just at this facility this past sunday (11-13-11) and wanted to use the spa for the rate of $25 but then the girl talked me into getting a massage for $ 125 so i decided to go ahead and get it done. when they presented the bill i was busy chatting and didn't realize that they upgraded the time to 75 minutes and now charged me $258 for the services instead of the $ 158 that i thought i was signing for.. the other girl behind the counter even said be careful as they will upgrade you w/o telling you and then charge you for it.. i just didn't think that it would happen as i am standing right there. i called them and after 3 phone calls they would not do anything about the bill. you think for a $100 they would want to save their reputation but i guess times are tough and they will screw you when given the chance .. i am never going there again and would not recommend it to anyone... i wish i had read the reviews prior to going over as i see the reviews are mediocre at best.. ps,. my friend also went to get a massage and she said the masseuse was too rough and when she asked her to ease up pressure, she went so light that it didn't even feel ike a massage...so she opted out of the massage and got something else done.. never ... never... never again..."
2-star,0,"not happy!!! this place is a bit like a modified girls gym. the bathrooms are not clean. they aren't dirty, but i""ve never seen toilet paper on the floor of a bathroom or paper towels that didn't quite make it to the garbage can. there is no one that goes in every 10 minutes to clean these facilities as they do in other spas both on and off the strip. the atmosphere does not feel spa like at all. it feels more like a gym and not even a high end one at that. the lighting is bright in some places, and lowered in others without consideration that guests are moving through all of the spaces. i showed up 5 minutes early. is that cutting it close? yes for sure. does that mean that you take me into the massage 10 minutes late and then cut my massage time by 10 minutes because i am ""late""? not cool mandara spa... not cool.... the massage itself was acceptable, but again, i kind of felt like these poor masseuses have negative energy from a lack of repeat clients as the strip feels a bit like a churning wheels. i would absolutely not go back unless some amazing sign was given by a massive increase in positive reviews on yelp."
2-star,0,"you can find a better place. over priced and they interrupt your ""relaxing"" spa experience trying to sell you stuff. kind of pathetic."
1-star,0,"i expected to be dissappointed with the mani/pedi because spas rarely give you your money's worth for this service but i needed it so i went to mandara at paris. i was more than dissapointed. this was easily the worst mani/pedi i've ever had - from the exfolitation so vigorous my feet hurt to the ""massage"" better described as a lotion application to the polish that turned white (white?) within a day. i was also the beneficiary of sales pitches for every possible manicure product sold at mandara. once again i have learned my lesson, do not go to a spa for manicures or pedicures."
2-star,0,"had a massage here and had such high hopes...but was let down. i was stoked since i had my spa finder gift cards - but it wasn't worth the trouble. the massage itself was just ""okay"". the space and the amenities were so-so. the staff and service is what really brings this down a couple stars. my masseuse was nice enough but i can't stand when they are trying to sell you things. i don't know if they work on commission but basically she was pushing on having me buy some stuff (massage oil?) through the massage. sooooo annoying. and conveniently they had her recommended items ready for me at check out. (ummm, no). i don't plan to visit again. they managed two stars since it was at least clean. oh well."
3-star,0,"well, i am a little biases because this was my first massage experience, but let me tell you from the best i can. the waiting room and spa facilities were nice. one thing i personally both liked and didnt like is the men women separation. my bf didn't want to go because we couldn't be together so we went to the pool instead to lounge together. i later had a massage and body scrub and then a mani pedi. the massage and scrub was great. it could have lasted forever and the lady was very nice. oh the waiting room. not really anything to snack on there, even though they said they do. whole fruit? more like decoration. and no orange juice. i am a sucker for orange juice. so they offered the choice between their basic mani pedi and the deluxe, and the difference was this little rolling stool and and really nice chair, but i dont think i justifies about $50 difference. the manicurist was nice and keep trying to sell me stuff, but they get commission so i understood so it didnt bother me. she did a good job and i was done. i would go again for massage, but probably somewhere else for mani pedi."
2-star,0,"this spa hit the mother lode of suckitude. i foolishly forgot to get a pedi before getting on the plane but i could not in good conscience put my nasty claws out on the streets of vegas. my back was against the wall and i knew that i had to suck it up and spring for an overpriced strip pedicure. ok. fine. i made my bed. since i was staying at the paris, i made a last minute appointment there. here's where the annoyance comes in. i ask the lady at the spa desk for a pedi. she says in a voice with a note of contempt...""we have a basic...and i mean very basic...pedicure for $65."" now the voice gets shrill and upbeat ""or we have our signature spa pedicure, which is a much much more relaxing experience for $120."" thick painted on smile. i get it. you want to up sell me. so i ask what's the difference. the answer: spa chair. that's it? wtf. $55 bucks for a spa chair. no thanks. so i politely decline and get a look like i am the cheapest bastard in the world. whatever. just fix my feet, please. i return for my appt and am greeted by a less than friendly clinician. she then does the same up sell speech, showing me the spa chairs. (which are in no way gold plated) annoying. no thanks. but seriously, paris, a rolling stool with no back in the middle of the main hallway? that's my $65 option? it was like the pedi of shame. i had to keep myself from rolling around while all of the other people walk by wondering what i was oing in the middle of the hallway. that said, i was determined to enjoy myself despite them and the pedi itself came out fine. when i went to check out, the price came to $80ish. i said, ""i thought it was $65?"" they say, we automatically charge a 15% gratuity. huh? where do you get off deciding how much i give for gratuity? it's not like i was a table of 6 or more.i was going to tip 20% but now you can all suck it. and for that, 2 stars!!!"
1-star,0,"way overpriced!!! nothing was special about this place. and thats really sad because we spend like 350 for a couples massage for only 60 min... :( the shower/ steam/ jacuzzi area was awful! i mean my gym has better amenties then that!! oh and the massage therapists didn't actually give you the whole time in my opinion...i think they included dressing time and stuff...lame..but not nearly as lame as the medicore massage that we recieved...attention: it's called pressure, and when i'm getting a massage i would like to feel some pressure...otherwise i could rub my own body thank you!! next time i'm in town i'm trying ceasers!"
1-star,0,"i had a really good massage. emphasis on the had. i should have known when i first got there that the front desk staff was incompetent. they didn't know their policies or processes if their lives depended it. to be fair, if you have a straight forward transaction like you'll use the credit card that you made your reservation under, stuff like that then you probably won't have a problem. they can't handle anything more than that. also, their price list is wrong. they should follow the price list, i think by law, but they don't. they just say it's old. but then why have it out? and why are the internet prices the same too? they also tack on a mandatory service charge. anyhow, my friends' experiences were not that great. they had rooms that were cold. one friend went with the four-hands massage. well her room was friggin' cold and with two people working on you there isn't anywhere for you to be covered. so you're a$$ed out (no pun intended) with having a cold massage. she also complained of too much light int he room but they couldn't do anything about it as it was windows that were letting in the light. so she came out of her treatment crying. mind you, this is a $300+ treatment. so we went to complain. the girl in the back was helpful, but she ain't the manager. it took the manager over 20 minutes to get back to talk to us. she couldn't even look at us. kept her eyes shut as she spoke. what's worse, she was the concierge!!! wtf?!?! shouldn't you be kissing my feet? anyhow, she promised something and we hung out at the spa a little longer. when we went to check out, our transactions were already processed, where they said that we don't pay till the end b/c i was trying to pay up front and not deal with this mess after i'm all relaxed. whatever. whatever the concierge promised didn't get communicated back up front. no one knew what to do. the next shift manager hid from us in the back. it was lame. oh and uh the spa facilities suck too btw. i guess the day we were there someone made off with the lotion. wtf?!?! don't you have extra? wierd. but if you are brave enough to deal with this mess, look up david as your masseuse. he is bomb! he has a warm room and even hooked me up with some hot stones! if i could write a review on just him, i'd give him 5 stars."
4-star,1,"truth be told...i'm not a big spa fan. i don't like milling around in my robe and slippers with a bunch of other women i don't know. it's no fun. i can't stand steam rooms, hot tubs, etc. etc. but...i do like this spa because it was uncrowded, unassuming, simple but clean and had that spa ambiance with the nice showers, lotions, hair dryers, etc. it doesn't have that weird, mega-spa feeling i've had at say, the westin mission sonoma spa. my girlfriends and i all enjoyed our 80 minute massages, fruit, tea, and other things you usually expect in a chi chi spa experience...just without the attitude. and i highly suggest that if you're going for a massage, that you upgrade that standard 60 to an 80 minute. 60 is never enough, but 80...that's the way to go."
4-star,1,"staff friendly. areas clean except men's locker room not so much.... huge workout area allows for free immersion, transition, and isolation according to preference. don't know why people come in groups and then stand or sit in your way??? planning using as home base for now. will use massage stations next time!!"
5-star,1,"this is the best gym in westeros. you would think weirdos like giants, night walkers, or even an imp would bother you during a vigorous workout. sometime they even leave pizza out for you/peasants from kings-landing. jon snow the manager of this establishment, is one of he kindest people you'll ever meet. they have weights here that even the mountain/ hounds brother would lift from time to time. summer is coming so get your workout in cause winter is here. ps i'm a game of thrones fan."
4-star,1,"not a bad gym. cheap price, nice equipment, and open 24/7. very diverse crowd, but not a whole lot of group classes i guess due to space."
5-star,1,"excellent location, great equipment, terrific staff. this location has just installed brand new equipment in the building and it has been somewhat upgraded again. however set it there clientele would not miss a beat they offered everyone to use three other facilities for one 24 hour period until they installed and updated new equipment. they let everyone know in advance by sending out numerous emails which everyone informed. this particular location has always been a definite benefit to the surrounding area. the pricing is affordable and the facilities are terrific."
1-star,0,"i don't normally post reviews, but this deserves one. i have been a black card member of planet fitness on and off for probably close to 10 years. it isn't the best gym, but it has been convenient. 2 years ago, i resigned a basic membership and was offered a black card special for the same price. i took it. have the black card to prove it. i have received all the black card privileges for the last 2 years.....until today. an assistant manager in belmont said that they were not going to honor the agreement. thankfully, i have memberships at multiple gyms. needless to say, i cancelled my membership. these people don't seem to care about member retention, and there are much better gyms out there."
1-star,0,"the belmont location is much better. the staff in gastonia, along with some of the members that they talk to, are grossly ill mannered and do not need to be working in the public."
1-star,0,i joined the gym in gastonia last fall. i was happy with the gym until i encountered a male in the ladies' locker room. i called today to ask about the locker room policy and was told that starting this week any male is free to walk into the ladies' locker room. they call this transgender friendly. i call it anti-female and anti-safety. i am cancelling my membership immediately. i think that the gastonia franchise should at least have the decency to announce this change so women know not to undress out in the open.
2-star,0,it's so crowded in the afternoons that it's miserable. i'm about to cancel my membership because i can't stand going there. they need more than one gastonia location. also wish they had a stand up tanning bed. giving two stars because the staff are always nice.
5-star,1,"i have been a member for over 1 year. it's a spacious facility filled with every kind of exercise equipment you could want. it's clean, seems to be well run and there is usually never any ""wait"" to use equipment. oh, and the price is great!"
5-star,1,"this is a great fitness facility! i have been a member for years and this is place is never dirty, staff are alway polite and friendly, machines are readily available, and it is $10 a month! great! i go daily m-f, have for years, and this place is consistently great! did i say it only costs $10 a month?!?! if you are in the market for a new gym membership--check them out!!!"
4-star,1,"the street name of this location says it all - there is hope for mass market fitness centers. clean, well maintained, well stocked paper towels and cleaner, and extensive selection of cardio equipment - this is what chain fitness centers should be like. having purchased a weekly pass for $30.00, i was impressed by the sheer number of cardio equipment at the gastonia location. row after row of treadmills, bikes and other cardio equipment prevented any waiting for machines, even that the busiest hours. since i was a visitor to the area, i had never heard of planet fitness but as i started this review, i discovered that they are in california as well. move over 24 hour fitness, a new player is in town and if the california locations are anything like the one in gastonia, your days are numbered."
5-star,1,i recently switched from la fitness and all i can say so far are positive things about planet fitness . i have been to this location and the one on 35th avenue and peoria . both are immaculate . i love how they are both so clean . the hydro massage beds are amazing after the workout . i look forward to coming back for more workouts .
5-star,1,dylan was extremely patient and accommodating of my questions. he took the time to explain the various programs in details and may have convinced me to join the program whereas i was previously in the fence. i would definitely recommend speaking to him.
4-star,1,"i'm actually a fan of planet fitness. i like there approach, making it a judgement free zone. the peoria location is pretty big with a ton of equipment in it. they have their icon purple on everything. the men's locker is well maintained. overall the location is pretty clean. i really like having the lockers and showers. the only thing i can think of to improve is for them to provide sweat and drying towels. that would a full service to me. the employees are pretty good. always nice and want to say hi. i don't like it when they leave one person there all day. i prefer seeing two working the desk. in this particular strip mall there is a huge parking lot. i mean, huge! you will always park pretty close. i haven't had a bad experience with planet fitness at either of the locations i've been a member that."
1-star,0,"don't sign up at this gym!! i have been coming to this gym since june. out of the blue a young kid named jesus( general manager) lol told me i'm not allow to carry a gym bag on the floor and that i need to put it in a locker. ya no need for that i will just cancel my membership. one has ever came up to me and advised me of this policy. maybe you should go over your policy's, some people need to carry their medical things. ya i will go to a normal gym and not be criticized in response to the comment made by your customer service rep. gym bag was on the side of machine it's impossible for someone to trip cause you can't walk in between machines. gym isn't responsible for stolen items in lockers so i rather take my gym bag and go someplace else. in a recent post someone had their items stolen and no action was taken. yet you allowed people on couple occasions to work out in flip flops, bare feet on tread mill etc."
1-star,0,"the staff is friendly (only reason i am giving them one star. you are not allowed to carry a small bag into gym & have to lock it up & if it gets stolen they are not responsible. had my locker broken into & phones, id, belongings stolen. never received a call from the manager. stay away from this location as staff is unprofessional & they don't care about their customers!!"
1-star,0,"they say judgment free zone but they have no such thing. my family were laughed at, pointed at and called fat pigs.they allow those people to still work out and do nothing about it. when you try to stick up for your self they cancel your membership without any notification. employees are rude they do not let you talk to the manager and lie about their name. after they cancel your membership without any notification they still want to keep your annual fee when you only went there two months of this year. please do not go to this gym you will be fat shamed for trying to be healthy and they will steal your money. they lost three devoted customers and i hope more after people read this review."
1-star,0,"never coming here again, seen cockroaches and when i set my snack down to work out when i got back i came back to a half eaten oatmeal bar and a little mouse running away, this place is disgusting and filthy i wouldnt take a free membership even if they offered. never going here again. i'm glad they canceled my membership now! i wasnt mad till the mouse ate my snack. horrible staff and manager. mise well take a wrecking ball and take the whole building out!"
2-star,0,"positives - new facility/equipment, larger than most other locations, friendly staff for the most part (when they're not too busy gossiping with each other), it's never too busy that you have to wait for equipment (i go late morning). i love the dressing rooms in the showers. negatives - it's a brand, new facility and when something other than a machine breaks, it doesn't get fixed. a towel hook in one of the showers has been broken/missing since the second week it was open. as of last weekend, both of the tvs in the ladies locker room have not been working. neither of these is essential to working out, but you'd think in a brand new facility things would be functioning at 100%. i wish someone could take a quick swipe in the showers every few hours and pick up the globs of other people's hair off the shower floor. the other major irritant is the temperature disparity from one area to the next. the massage chair rooms are usually freezing cold....at least 15-20 degrees cooler than the main gym. the tanning area is extremely hot...15-20 degrees warmer than the main gym. again, this isn't the main purpose of the gym, but if i'm paying $20 just for those amenities, it would be nice if those extra areas were comfortable. i would tan and massage more, but i've learned to check the temps first before going to the trouble of checking in at the front desk for them. back when they first opened, staff would tell members that they were having a hard time getting the thermostats right, but it's been several months and nothing has changed. all in all, it gets the job done for a very reasonable price. i just wish there was more attention to detail in a brand new gym."
4-star,1,"great location. i also noticed if a machine is out of service, it actually gets repaired in a timely manner. the equipment is awesome. wish they had clocks in the stretching/core room, the 360 room and the 30 min circuit. the cup containers on the treadmills, needs to be cleaned more. i noticed the staff usually just wipes only the outside of the machine. i love the pe@pf classes. surprised not many sign up. not sure if they are aware. they should start them off with one when a member signs up. strange how the other reviews got deleted from here. i know there were more before i signed up."
5-star,1,"the gym is great, new equipment is always awesome but it's not the equipment that makes this my gym, its the staff. there's not a day i go in when the manager elijah is there that he doesn't greet me by name or ask me how far i'm running today. i'm betting i'm not the only person that gets that personalized experience. the rest of the staff is equally as friendly, some of them refer to me by name as well. to be honest i am there almost every day so it's easy to remember me i'm sure, but that's why i feel good enough about myself to go all the time i feel welcome. that comes from the top down, great leadership creates a great environment. because of planet fitness glendale and more over peoria i'm not afraid to workout because of what the staff or other members might think of me. and because of that i'm in the best shape of my life down from 236 pounds to 162. if you are looking for a great gym with a friendly and inclusive environment this is the place."
5-star,1,"it's my first time to enroll in a gym. i find it hard to ""drag"" myself to go but since this is a new gym, i felt i should try this. i love all the new equipment and the other facilities. i also like the big tv screens that i can choose from. the massage chairs are also the best! last week, while i was enjoying the hydromassage, i saw that the timer had gone off but it immediately restarted and seeing that there weren't people inside the room, i continued to enjoy the massage and closed my eyes. i was startled when their gym instructor named meghan came in, unceremoniously switched it off and said, ""i need you to get off now because there's somebody who's going to use it."" no smile, no ""please"". i felt insulted. it was just rude of her to do that. it was my first rude encounter and i just had to let this off my chest. i'm still giving planet fitness 5 stars for the facilities but a failing mark in customer service!"
5-star,1,"i love this place so much. the women here are amazing. i almost don't want to post a glowing review because i get really happy if i get there and somehow it's a smaller class size. but this barre studio is a gem. it's like therapy going, it's a great work out that never hurts my old injuries (been in many car accidents), yet i'm lifting and shaping and toning my entire body. the owner is wonderful and takes classes here herself. the staff are kind and happy and know what they are talking about and take the time to help u with movements. i literally have nothing negative to say and i've been going for months now. i'm thankful i found this studio."
5-star,1,"i've been doing barre at the chandler location since may 2014 and absolutely love it! if you haven't tried it, you must! it's addicting and you honestly see results! my body has never looked so toned! cancelled my gym membership because i'm so in love with this workout! the owners veronica and marirose are the sweetest and they truly care about their customers, they also listen to feedback. it's a family here! join us! tip: wear yoga pants with skinny legs or capris, bring sticky socks or buy some at the studio."
5-star,1,"pure barre chandler is the cleanest, friendliest and most effective gym i've ever been to, the instructors are so sweet, patient and encouraging. the results are far better than any workout i've ever tried, so worth it!"
5-star,1,"this workout and studio are amazing! i started while recovering from foot surgery and it definitely helped me heal. i've taken classes from several instructors at the chandler studio and they all have been welcoming, encouraging, and helpful!"
5-star,1,"great class! the instructors are amazing. this is for any type of person. stick with it because it never gets easier. the first class will be very intense and confusing but afterwards, you become hooked!"
5-star,1,"i found this studio about a year ago and love it. sadly, i started graduate school and struggle scheduling barre around my school and work schedule. whenever i get a chance, i take class and remember why it is so awesome. instructors and front desk staff make it a point to learn everyone's name, and they are very encouraging and hands-on. the only thing that would make this studio better is a 7 am class in the mornings. the owners are also very hands on and instruct classes at this studio a couple of times per week. the studio is costly, but worth it."
5-star,1,"ladies (gentlemen, too), please do yourself a favor a try a class at pure barre! my friend made me go with her to try and i reluctantly went with her and i will admit i hated my first class. being just a mediocre active person, i was disappointed in myself for not finishing the intense reps of lifting, toning and burning but man did i feel amazing after that first class. so i signed up for the new student special and am still in my first month and i am addicted! i will continue for sure. i am not very athletic or flexible but i absolutely love fun group fitness classes to awesome music; i've tried so many. but pure barre quickly has become my favorite. to top it off, all the girls are so sweet. they are so helpful and understanding and will always greet you smiling."
5-star,1,the girls here are so encouraging and sweet! you don't feel discouraged like other classes. i hate working out and i finally found a class that keeps me coming back! all of the instructors that i've had take the time to introduce themselves and cheer you on during class. the girls in the front are even awesome!
5-star,1,the first time i came here maddy was at the front desk. i came here 20 mins before a class starting. she talked to me explaining to me it's a cross between high impact aerobics meets yoga meets pilates meets ballet. well with 20 mins to spare i bought an outfit (because i thought this was a juice bar) and i dove in with my two feet! well....half way in class yes i did want to have a heart attack but i got through. i have a medical condition and all the instructors here will help you and make it work for you! they motivate you and make sure you get through each class. after three classes i saw immediate results. everyone here is so nice and welcoming. if they don't know you they will ask you your name and will remember it! they have a great selection of workout clothes!!! trust me lots of money has been spent here! they sell the most delicious smelling candles and adorable bracelets! if you're looking for a new workout look no further! all the girls of pbc will welcome you here
4-star,1,"i was looking for a group fitness place nearby home and from the reviews and the testimonials i decided to sign up. attended my first class this morning and not only was trish very accommodating, she kept an eye out and helped me modify the moves so i could do them. wow was it difficult! i am still feeling it 3 hours later. very interested in getting better as i was only able to do about half of the moves for a quarter of the time i needed to. so glad i found this place."
5-star,1,"this workout is addicting! hardest workout i've ever done but super effective. with diet i lost more than 10lbs in 4 weeks. i love the energy from the music and the instructors and the personalized attention in class. i am leaner, stronger, and more confident than ever thanks to pure barre. it's a way of life now and i crave going to class. highly recommend it!"
5-star,1,"i'm hooked! i've never been the type of person that wanted to work out but i figured i better start, like it or not. i didn't want the typical gym feel so i decided to try pure barre. i've actually been excited about going and look forward to the next class. i've taken class with sara and bryanna and they are both amazing. they keep you motivated and help you along the way. no one in class looks at you funny if you can't so something as well as they can do it. it's just a group of girls/women that are trying to better themselves, not to judge others. i'm in love!"
5-star,1,"since i was accustomed to hiit training, i was really hesitant to try pure barre at first. 9 months later, leaner than ever, and addicted to the burn, i can't get enough of pure barre chandler. the instructors are always welcoming and energetic. the music puts me in the zone hitting the right bpm for all the different segments. and last, but not least the variation of exercises works muscles i've never felt before. i highly recommend taking at least 10 classes to get acclimated with the moves and to really start feeling the difference. lifttoneburn!"
5-star,1,what's not to love?! best fitness class in the valley by far! i have never seen quicker results then i have with pure barre. and let's not forget about the fabulous ladies who teach the classes! can they get any hotter?! :) talk about inspiration to hold that tuck just a little bit longer! ltb for life! xo
1-star,0,"out of all the places in the phoenix area who offer barre classes, this particular pure barre location has to be the worst. they have just one routine and it never varies. they never ask at the beginning of the class if anyone is new or if anyone has any injuries they need to be aware of. the cutesy 20-somethings who teach these classes make no adjustments for their older clientele. they expect a 63 year old to be able to do the exact same things that a 23 year old can do. no one ever asked permission to touch me when making a correction either. this is not cool at all. i don't need some snippy instructor touching my pelvis or butt without asking permission first. i would not go back after going 7 times and i would not recommend it to anyone i care about either."
5-star,1,"if you've been considering taking a pure barre class, stop considering and just do it! i started taking classes 2 weeks ago today. in the past 14 days, i've gone to 13 classes. each class has been completely different. you don't have to worry about any sort of annoying repetition. i can't say enough about the instructors. i haven't had a class with everyone yet, but i've taken classes led by sara, bryanna and jasmine. i couldn't pick a favorite instructor if i had to! all three are amazing and different from each other. regardless, once the 60 minute class is over, i'm dripping sweat! my fiancee thinks it's funny because after each class i call him and say, ""wow that was the best class ever!"" the website doesn't give you much in terms of what to expect, so if you're curious.. as far as attire, wear yoga pants and a tank. you don't want to wear shorts or capri's that are on the shorter side. you really want your legs to be covered so that your muscles stay warm. also, there are many exercises that are done on your knees, so wearing pants makes that much easier. make sure you bring a pair of socks with you. if you want new ones, they sell pure barre socks at the studio (which are wonderful!). you'll also want to bring a bottle of water and a small towel for sweat! if you're concerned about being inexperienced or even out of shape, don't worry about it! your class will be full of women who are experienced, inexperienced, in great shape, in horrible shape, young and old. you can go at your own pace, so don't worry about anyone but yourself. the instructors are awesome about coming around and fixing your form if you're having a hard time or if you can't figure something out. what are you waiting for? register for a class now! :-)"
5-star,1,"a great workout for toning, motivational instructors, and a schedule that fits yours! i am obsessed with this place! as much as you feel yourself getting stronger and leaner, the routine never gets easier. i have been attending since the end of march and the instructors always add ways to make the exercises more difficult to challenge your body every time! it is the perfect place for toning! i recently completed the 30-day challenge and was able to see a 4% body fat decrease (without focusing on dieting). my entire body has become leaner. the instructors will keep you coming back! and although i have my favorites, i haven't found one that i don't like. they all have great ways of motivating and challenging you to get the most out of your workout! pure barre is open 365 days out of the year and offers several times that can fit your schedule. i know, as my schedule has varied greatly over the past few months and i'm always able to find a time to go. lastly, your membership applies to chandler, scottsdale and phoenix locations! if you're new, definitely give the new client special a try ($100 for the month). i have been fortunate to run into several specials since starting at pure barre in march and have yet to pay the full monthly price."
5-star,1,"where to start??! i love this place. every instructor i've had is fantastic; they are all encouraging and patient. i feel like my form is corrected 15 times during some classes, but it's always in a positive way. they somehow are very good at remembering names.. it's impressive. the fellow classmates are always friendly, it really is just a great environment for self-improvement. although, i dare anyone to attend a few classes and not be tempted to go hit up lululemon (or anything similar) for new gear. the studio itself is great. it's clean and open and inviting. there is an area for personal stuff in the back, no locker room, but a bathroom if you have to make a quick change after work, before class. most importantly, the workout! it is tough. after my first class i was sore for a good four days, but of course it's nice to know that your muscles exist. :) some days i feel like i'm a machine, but pure barre always finds a way to bring me back to reality. my legs shake like i'm standing on a fault line and i'm pretty sure some day i will fall over.. i guess that's what the barre is for. anyway.. i've been coming fairly consistently for almost two months, and i have seen tremendous changes in myself. every day after pure barre feels like a skinny day! my arm muscles and collarbone are starting to poke out.. i've lost inches in my waist and arms; it's great to see actual progress. and since the class is just 55 minutes and is very fast-paced, it's pretty easy to carve out time during the day to come to class. i certainly don't experience the same level of dread as i do with the ""regular"" gym. it is expensive, but since i've been going, there have been deals and promotions to ease up on price. at this point i'd rather pay for pure barre than continue to carry a gym membership to a place that i don't really like going. if you're on the fence, give it a shot! it'll win you over."
5-star,1,"i started pure barre on march 30th, i am completely addicted! i have never seen faster results or had more fun doing it. the girls are amazing. the fact that i look forward to getting in my car and going, making new friends and meeting new faces while doing it, listening to awesome music, pushing myself harder each time due to the great motivation is all priceless! trust me, its worth every penny. ltb!"
5-star,1,"i am so thrilled that pure barre came to chandler. it is the best hour long full body workout with upbeat music and encouraging instructors. i am 15 days into my 30 day challenge and am a little addicted to how good i feel after each class. i can feel my body changing one inch at a time. veronica, the owner, is a doll and it is obvious how passionate she is about pb. the instructors are all fantastic and dedicated to helping ensure good form while they torture... ahem.. i mean help you achieve your fitness goals :-) best workout on the planet. lift tone burn baby!"
5-star,1,"awesome workouts and fantastic instructors! i never knew that i could get tough workout with barely moving a muscle. i will give a warning: this is a tough workout with great results. i love the staff and they are so friendly. this location is so close to work that i can sneak in a workout during lunch. if you want to get a jump on your swim suit body, check out pure barre. in two weeks you will see a serious difference!!! thanks ladies!"
4-star,1,"""...defies gravity by lifting everything up"". my glutes better be mid back and my boobs up to my chin! ...coz it b u r n s!!!"
1-star,0,the change room is kept clean but not the equipment. staff is rude and constantly on their phone. they do not make any effort to make you feel welcome (especially the girl this morning). it seems that management only responds to positive reviews and has no interest in addressing issues of unhappy customers : it already tells you a lot about that place!
1-star,0,"while striving to be one of toronto's ""finest"" facilities they fall short by quite a wide margin. the facility is extremely overpriced relative to its product offering which i can only assume is justified by the fact that the location is in leaside. a simple analysis of rates between competitors would show that you would derive far better bang for your buck at gyms such as la fitness (don mills and york mills), or goodlife fitness (yonge and eglinton) who are at a similar price point but also include a wider selection of classes and squash/ basketball courts. dealing with their management has also been nightmarish. the week that i signed up they convinced me to attend an initial assessment with a ""health professional"" to determine my baseline physical fitness. during the course of 45 mins this ""professional"" relentlessly tried to push personal training on me for 6 months. i had to pull every excuse out of the hat that i could think of from... just finishing grad school, recently getting married and not having the extra cash. only to have him respond with... ""we'll work something out"", in a very loan sharkish tone! after a few months i left pure fitness and have since joined fit 4 less. while their facilities are as barebones as they get, there's no harassment from management, the gym is kept exceptionally clean given the few staff employed, and you can't argue with the monthly rates if you live in leaside and want to stay active and healthy, you have a couple options... 1) jog outside year round, or 2) venture a little further outside of leaside and visit a gym that is finer than pure fitness. 1 star."
2-star,0,"i echo chris a.'s review. the gym is well maintained, but of course it should be. it is nothing different from a goodlife location but costs more and is only one location. they are slimey when it comes to billing and cancellation of membership, where you have to 'talk to the manager' and other types of avoidance strategies. it's all very obvious what they're trying to do, so think twice before signing up and make sure to keep your commitment period brief (4-5 months max). goodlife will probably just buy this location or open one nearby and that will be it."
2-star,0,"first, this isn't a bad gym in terms of clean, well maintained equipment. change rooms are also maintained and their hours are the usual. it's also rarely packed. actually, i think the only time it was packed was around new years, which is understandable. but the staff is horrible. they're pushy but don't budge on negotiating a better price than the ""special"" price you're quoted. then they don't care about you after you sign up but when it's time to renew your membership suddenly you're interesting to them again. the best thing this gym has going for it is that it's very close by if you live in leaside. but for a better, cheaper experience it's worth the relatively short drive elsewhere."
5-star,1,"the best gym that i have joined... affordable, great atmosphere and well maintained. clean, bright and friendly managers/staff. great selection of classes and great day care providers... just wish they had more day care hours during the afternoon hours. it is busy enough to give you motivation but never cramped. the management team run a fantastic gym and give great service.. so far ;)"
2-star,0,"not impressed. dirty towels everywhere. no one even at the front when we walked in. but get inside, and i was immediately jumped on by personal trainers that couldn't take the polite hint that i didn't want to buy sessions. ended up taking a yoga class that was uninspiring but got the job done. bathrooms were clean and there were plenty of open machines, so that was a small plus. clientele was a bit creepy. may have just been the day i went, but i will still be looking at other gyms."
1-star,0,"oh gosh, what a place this is! the only i liked about this place was the little aerobics room- i would use it as a personal dance studio when there weren't classes. the place was very sweaty, hot, and disgusting. bleh! the staff there is just concerned with money! they try and push supplements on you repeatedly! i tried them for several months and honestly cannot say they made any noticeable difference. i felt judged when going there because people would stare at my confusion towards several machines. most machines are old and some are not working for weeks at a time. the girls behind the counter seem clueless and are definitely only in it for the paycheck... they act like as though you are inconveniencing them if you ask questions. when i canceled, they gave me the run around for over a month. finally, after the manager refused to return my calls, i went in and was then charged for two more months as a ""60 day notice"". oh, and, my sister-in-law went and was cheated out of over two thousand dollars! they convinced her that she had to pay up front for an extreme amount of personal training as part of a discounted price. well, when my brother got deployed as part of the military one month later, she was never refunded her money! that's ridiculous!"
2-star,0,the account was finally fixed. it took four months and several phone calls. it appears that i had to find the right person to complete the task. other than that it is a basic facility. it gets the job done.
1-star,0,"so since my original review, my previous trainer has left this location, and i have not been given any information why she left. also, they decided to change the plan i had to a ""group work out"" session instead of a personal training session. i tried this a few times, and it really wasn't for me. when i go for a training session, i want a one-on-one session so the trainer can focus on my progress rather than the group's. but, the final straw that will make me never join pure fitness again is i received a letter yesterday from my apartment complex stating that all our memberships with pure fitness will be canceled in 3 days. my plan was part of a deal that my apartment complex had with the old owners of the gym. now, the gym is under new ownership, and instead of letting us have a ""trial period"" to see if the gym has changed for the better, they are just dumping us as customers. i see that the new owners do not care about the previous clientele enough to allow them to see how the new ownership will change the gym for the better. they did offer us an out of pocket membership for an extra charge a month, but we would have to sign up before the old memberships cancel. i would have liked more notice that the ownership was changing hands, and more time to decide if i would like to stay with this gym. i will be taking my business elsewhere as i start my search for a good gym that will meet my needs."
1-star,0,"what a terrible place. my so called ""trainer"" could barely speak full sentences let alone english. he kept pushing pills on me and was very distracted by all of his ""gym rat friends"". he was not attentive. as for the ""membership"" i could not change it to a normal one, which is not what the manage told me when i signed up with him. i have called numerous times to speak with him and he will not get on the phone or return the messages i have left. his receptionist staff have no clue what they are talking about and are very sketchy over the phone, it's ridiculous. the girl could not tell me they were going to try and charge me a fee to cancel ( i have had it) because supposedly everyone's plans are different. do not go here. so scammy and sketchy. dirty equipment as well..."
1-star,0,"this company does its best to mislead customers about it's memberships. there is no such thing as ""no membership fees"" or ""month to month"" memberships with no contract. do yourself a favor and don't join. if you do join make sure you read every page of your contract - even the fine print before you sign. don't be distracted by the sales person they are probably beat over the head with quota so the customer means nothing to them. they just hope you won't read what you're signing. it's hard to believe businesses get away with such shameful practices."
5-star,1,"i have been a member at this location for the last 3 years. from the day i joined the staff has been polite and friendly. mike coates, the manager, has been onsite from day one. he runs a tight ship, and is the main reason the facility is the way it is. the staff always welcomes me upon arrival and bids me a 'have a good workout'. upon departure the staff 'thanks me' and bids me 'fairwell'. it's all a personal touch that goes a long way. the facility is clean, well staffed, and has the equipment and programs that i enjoy. currently there has been a high energy class called 'met con' that takes place mon-fri for a half hour at 6pm and 6:30pm. it is intense, and the instructor, zach, is perfect for the role. he keeps the class moving, encourages pushing yourself, and focuses on good form for the excercises. i will continue enjoying my workouts at pure fitness and look forward to mike and his staff 's hospitality."
2-star,0,"there are so many things wrong with this gym that i could probably write a small book on its gross lack of customer service and inattentiveness to detail, but i'll try to sum it up in under 20 paragraphs. pf puts far more emphasis on the customer it's trying to court than the one it already has. basically, a sell-sell-sell attitude. once you are a member, you're nothing to them anymore. -i've tried to get the tv put on to no avail sometimes. pf has numerous tvs and often a big game will be showing where people are doing cardio but where people (moslty men) are lifting free weights, we'll get news or golf. ""i don't know how to work the tv"" or ""i'll ask someone to do it"" are popular responses. i've even been turned down trying to get an asu game on and that's the local team. disappointing for a gym with satellite tv. - pf has lowered rates for new customers and done nothing for their existing ones. they've even given equipment away to one of their other gyms meaning you're getting less for your money. - trainers hold special aerobics classes inside the gym. no, not inside the aerobics room, inside the gym where people work out. it's not unusual to see people doing wind sprints up and down the hallway or a group of people doing ab work in front of a machine you'd like to use. -for years this place didn't provide paper towels. if you wanted to clean down equipment or your brow, you had to buy a towel or bring your own. the bathroom only had heated dryers or toilet paper. it now has paper towel dispensers but some are often empty and workers rarely care. patrons here do a great job cleaning up after themselves. - pushing supplements is more important than pushing you to work harder. this location has a very hard time keeping female trainers. women are constantly being hired, but they don't last long. i'm told being a trainer there is very difficult because you are not just required to recruit a stable of people to train, you have to sell them supplements as well. pf sells its own brand of supps and trainers will tell you how wonderful they are, better prices than stores, etc. i think the trainers are competent, i'm told they're required to sell stuff though and convincing one that apex is better than name brands and much cheaper is not what we want to hear during our training. - loose or damaged equipment is often left unattended. from week to week some of the same dumb bells are loose and i once reported a bent bar on the bench press and no one there cared to remove it. i told multiple employees too. - aerobics classes are subpar and so are the times. some of the classes are titled one thing and then when you get into the class they're doing something else. i once did a kickboxing class and the girl had us doing wind sprints and some kind of standing aerobic movements that didn't involve punching or kicking. many of their better classes start at like 5 p.m. it's almost as if their schedule is geared around students. there's a high turnover rate at this gym too. from the front desk girls to the trainers (many of the male trainers have been there a while) to the managers. there's literally a different manager there every few weeks and the guy who introduces himself to you on a wednesday and says 'if you have any problems my name's bob,"" will be named steve a few weeks later and mark after that. competitive pricing compared to other gyms, convenience and decent, clean equipment keep me going there. unless this gym is really convenient for you or the price is well below what other gyms are charging, check into your other options."
5-star,1,"luckily for me, i've only been approached once by a green trainer who was looking for financial support. i just act surprised that he interrupted my workout, and i plan to say (if i must speak),""when i am interested, i will come to you."" started in 07/2006 at $12.44/mo because i bought a year's worth, got 6 months free (access to *all* purefitness'). after that period, i payed monthly (autopay) at $15.24/mo. suddenly in january, the price went up to $16.05/mo, no reasoning. i called for explanations and was disregarded both times. actually, not big enough co$t to attempt a conversation with a puppet (like writing a letter to the pres of us). weight-room fantastic for my needs. cardio covers all i need. machines are well-greased, clean, and free of damage. tv's are low quality, though they have had plasmas just waiting to turn on!! one short-lived semi-manager was bragging to me (1 year ago) that they'd been turned on soon...still not! ha ha ha aerobics room (wooded flooring) is well equipped and usually empty, unless yoga, prankhalatneiokfe (fighting), or cardio classes are happening (morn and night). locker room is always roomy. showers are fine. i'm satisfied...thanks!"
5-star,1,"i love this studio, i recommend to everybody. alyssa,she so nice and friendly, studio is clean. always i met her get energy."
5-star,1,"i love everything about rebarre. the instructors are all so much fun and so kind, they are all highly trained, so all ages and exercise levels are welcome and accommodated. i always leave the classes feeling better then when i came in. i have also seen a transformation in my strength, stamina and tone. it feels like a family every time you walk in, everyone is welcomed by their name and made to feel part of the studio! it truly is my favorite barre!"
5-star,1,"i reached out to re-barre asking if they would be interested in donating to a fundraiser i was holding. alyssa responded immediately, offering to donate and asking if i would also like to try out a class. i ended up going in on a monday night for class, and loved it! first, the studio is super cute, everything is updated, new and clean. second, alyssa was super sweet and nice. her class was difficult, but not too difficult (modifications!) and i was sore for about 5 days after. i've done barre at pure barre before, but this class was much more difficult and enjoyable. third, her donation was highly sought after at our fundraiser and the girl who won it can't wait to try out her classes. thanks for experience, re-barre!"
5-star,1,"this is my favorite barre studio ever. i can't say enough good things about the instructors, clients and staff. it's a unbelievable workout and everyone is family. it's a joy to go every day!! if you're looking for a challenge and fantastic workout this is the place to go."
5-star,1,"i can't say enough great things about re-barre! i have attended barre class consistently for over a year now, and i'm not stopping anytime soon. each class is different and challenging and i'm never bored. i truly appreciate how the instructors are so fun, open, and helpful. they've even coached me through when i had different work-related injuries/setbacks to help get me reach my full potential. there are also many available times for class (6am to 6pm) which is accommodating for my busy schedule. i never regret going and i leave feeling more energized than when i've arrived. the environment they foster is one of unity and camaraderie, plus they have super cute clothes! check out re-barre...you'll love it!"
5-star,1,"i am a physical therapist and super picky when it comes to exercise studios. re-barre studio north scottsdale is the best studio i have been to yet. the location, size, cleanliness, schedule and variety of classes is the best i have seen (barre, yoga, buti yoga, mat pilates, zumba)! they also offer a breadth of workshops to deepen your personal practice as well: meditation, sound/gong healing, myofascial release!!! i am sooooo incredibly impressed and happy with all it has to offer! each instructor is incredible: unique style, great direction, personable, warm and welcoming, and always such a positive, encouraging spirit! i can't say enough about all of them!! also, they are soooo knowledgeable and highly encourage modifications so if you have any previous or current injuries (i have low back issues), the instructors help provide options in every single class so you can still deeply strengthen while avoiding aggravating any injury. this is huge, coming from a p.t. the level of knowledge, care and support the staff gives to the class each and every class is far beyond even i could have ever imagined. i think alyssa, the owner, hand-selected each instructor with perfection! if you have a young child, there is a drop-in childcare place called daydreams drop-in child care literally next door to here!!! so you can exercise and do something for yourself while your little one has fun next door. this is huge! and the studio has a lot of deals on groupon that you can get directly from the studio as well. i'm only a month and half into consistently going to re-barre and my body is completely changing. i am building muscle from the inside out, starting for my core (abs). my shoulders and arms are looking super toned and lean, not bulky whatsoever. i am getting my old surfing body back and soooo stoked! (we moved here from hawai'i and i started coming here due to reviews on yelp!) if you are looking to get into shape fast, have fun and be supported by amazing teachers and fellow classmates, come to re-barre studio north scottsdale. you will see everything i reviewed is 100% accurate! this place is perfection!!!"
5-star,1,"hands down the best exercise barre studio in scottsdale! and for that matter best workout in the area that will challenge and change your entire body. you will not regret buying a package or challenging yourself to a month unlimited use of the studio. best workout in an hour! re-barre will exceed your expectations in every way possible! i have noticed a change in my body quicker than any other workouts that i have tried in the past. the workout is intense, yet, the instructors are very well informed allowing beginners to advanced a great workout. all of the instructors are amazing!!! you will not be disappointed in any class or have to choose certain times when the ""great"" instructors are teaching. they have re-barre and buti yoga (you have to try buti yoga -- nothing like you have experienced before)! they also offer a zumba class; however, i have not attended a class. i cannot speak higher of the expertise and motivation from the instruction staff. every class is different, never boring or the same, thus, the preparation from the instructors to create multiple variations during class is impressive. i started at this studio back in january and spoke to a lady that has trained for over four years at the studio (btw in fantastic shape) and she continues to say that every class is still challenging, hence not boring and re-barre works. (all classes hit every core part of your body) you will embrace the shake! the studio itself is very welcoming and friendly from the staff to other clients training. i always leave class with a smile and look forward to my next class. thank you re-barre for lifting my booty and spirit! i am ready to go to the barre in the am!"
5-star,1,"i signed up almost 3 yrs ago on a groupon special thinking i would never last, wouldn't fit in, and the exercise wouldn't be my cup of tea or age related. my negative thoughts were quickly left at the door due to the warm welcome by alyssa and tamara. the instructors (yes, tamara and alyssa actually instruct) do a great job of cueing, validating, supporting, and encouraging. barre isn't the only fitness exercise offered either. buti (come be in our tribe!) and yoga (soliciting more members so we can add more classes!) are phenomenal and mix well with barre. seriously people, come join us at re-barre where ""everyone knows your name"" but more importantly we want to share our positive vibes!"
5-star,1,"i am so impressed by the quality of re-barre. they really are ""the barre where everyone knows your name."" the instructors do a great job of keeping the work out moving, offering modifications for all skill levels, and changing up the routines from class to class. as an instructor put it today (paraphrased): the hour is about you, focus on your body, and leave feeling better than when you came in. the instructors are so aware of everyone's positioning and compliment and help adjust as necessary. they're wonderful."
5-star,1,"i lived in the camden foothills apartment complex right behind the studio for a year and half and absolutely loved being able to walk 30 seconds to get this incredible barre studio. i had tried barre at another studio in california but didn't think it was for me since the workouts/routines seemed pretty repetitive and some of the ab workouts would hurt my neck and back. this studio, however, is truly the best of barre and i totally came to love this form of exercise because of re-barre. the instructors there are genuinely the kindest humans i've ever come across in any exercise setting, and truly make a point to know everyone's name. customer service that is really hard to come by. their positivity rubs off on the clients and everyone vibes good energy together. the instructors are also really great at helping you adjust your variations of the moves to fit your body type and abilities. the workouts are excellent/different every single time and they update their playlists often, which is impressive. they sometimes ask for workout requests before class so you can ensure you get to do your favorite moves (ask to do the pretzel - it's painfully wonderful). the resistance bands that they incorporate always left me feeling sore days later too. you don't necessarily sweat like crazy doing barre in general (which is nice if you don't like showering immediately after your workout), so you have to remember to continuously challenge yourself and try heavier weights and harder variations of pushups. they do offer a few zumba classes each week, which are super fun and make you forget it's even a cardio workout. their barre 75 classes on saturday mornings were great because it's 15 minutes of zumba before the full hour of barre."
5-star,1,"amazing studio and friendly staff! i took my very first buti yoga class from stephanie and it was incredible. she is so talented, energetic and fun! please go try this studio it won't disappoint. can't wait to go try the additional classes offered! oh and don't forget the beautiful yoga gear for sale there!"
5-star,1,"the most friendly environment! i always have so much fun there and feel welcome every single time. the zumba, buti yoga and the yoga classes are unbeatable."
4-star,1,"wow oh wow the friendly feeling i got the moment i walked into the door of this studio. first of all it's a beautiful space and has some fun clothes and things to buy in the front. the workout space is fairly small but it works. i was at the studio for buti yoga. the instructor was beautiful and great at teaching. unfortunately, the bar was right in the way of us being able to see ourselves in the mirror to make sure we were doing the poses correctly. we definitely worked up a sweat in his class. it was so much fun. studio is slightly pricey. a drop in is $20. i must say it is worth it for the wonderful hospitality."
5-star,1,"i am not one to write an overabundance of positive reviews but when i do write one, it is because the business has earned it! i love fitness and i love trying new things. i enjoy reformer pilates classes and love love love re-barre. i feel re-barre gets those little hard to get muscles that the big movements in pilates can't reach. i have up-ed the amount of classes i take at re-barre because i'm seeing positive toning results! and one word if i may about tamara. she doesn't just phone it in, you know... go through the motions. she is so good at what she does and her positive energy is contagious! when i take her class, i am truly happy to be there. love this studio!"
5-star,1,favorite barre studio in az. i got one month unlimited for $100. you will be deliciously sore if you go here. my favorite instructors are alyssa and tamara. this barre studio is my happy place. go. you will not regret it.
5-star,1,"i had my first class at re-barre today. i've been doing dailey method on and off for 2 years. trying a new studio is always a little uncomfortable when you are very familiar with another style. when i entered, i was great by a very friendly and welcoming staff member. while i was filling out my paperwork, the instructor came out to meet me. i received a tour and she gave me a little background on the studio. i felt totally comfortable by this point. the class and instructor were great. the class moved fluidly from one movement/exercise to the next. i loved the use of bands and balls to help engage even more. after the class i bought the one month unlimited package. they applied the $20 i paid for a single class to the $100- 1 month unlimited so i got it for $80. i'm really looking forward to the next 30 days! the environment is fun and i can already tell that i'm going to be sore tomorrow. this is a great sculpting workout for beginners through advanced fitness levels."
5-star,1,"okay so this is a seriously fun, seriously kick-butt workout! i discovered barre workouts about a year ago, and immediately became addicted. i have now tried all the studios in the area, and consider myself somewhat of a connoisseur by this point ;) re-barre is top-notch, with amazing instructors, super friendly staff, and awesome classes that will give you the results you want, if you stick with it! i have that delicious all-over soreness each time i do a class here :d gotta love that!!"
5-star,1,"i am a ""newbie"", just started barre for the first time, a few classes ago. i was hesitant to try a new form of exercise because i had no idea what to do or what barre entailed. but, at the encouragement of a friend, i gave rebarre a try. in addition to a great strengthening workout, i have to say that one big reason that i like rebarre (in addition to the workout) is the warm atmosphere. i love that the instructors know my name--even though they likely see hundreds of people each day. each time i walk through the door, i am so impressed that tamara remembers me by name. it makes me feel special, a feeling that you don't usually get from a gym. and, rebarre is a beautiful studio, but does not seem pretentious at all. everyone from the instructors to the clients have been very friendly and nice. even after just few classes i already feel part of the ""family"". :)"
1-star,0,"no alyssa this is not a case of bullying a small business...this is a sad case of mis communication with your employees. i too have several emails along with voice mails that i've given to american express, my story has never changed and the only error i had was the date in april that i attended class and purchased a package of 10 classes...it was april 24th vs the 9...big deal...you've stated in your post that you have security camera footage ( not sure what relevance this has) but i hope it has audio...i would love to hear the conversation on april 24th with tamara after class purchasing my package and never once mentioning canceling auto pay...those words never came out of mouth!! on purchasing this package tamara said my class that day would count as one used..as far as your accusation of ""using your facility for free"" no in fact the camera audio footage would be great here too....you can clearly hear me tell your front desk girl to charge my card on file for the visit on january 9th and again repeated this conversation on february 2nd...and on both visits she opens my account and has me verify my card!! this goes for the same visit on november 24th where i verbally told the front desk girl i wanted to cancel my autopay....she opened my account up in front of me, said i need you to write on a piece of paper confirming your canceling the autopay and date it...i did that and she followed up with telling me it would take 30 days to be effective...i was never told anything different regarding my not being able to cancel etc....so no alyssa your right i'm not buckling as you've stated because my claims are accurate not false...and yes your company did charge my card again for june not may....thankfully amex was on top of it and rejected it june 9th! i'm sad it has come down to me using yelp to communicate as you had not once personally tried to contact me when i first called to resolve this issue...instead you had your account manager calling me."
5-star,1,"i love coming to these workouts! the whole staff makes you feel so welcome and they're adding new things all the time to accommodate their clients lifestyle needs when it comes to their work out. i personally have loved having yoga with both of the alyssa's, their barre classes have turned me into a convert as well! love meeting new people through the studio, everyone is very sweet and it's just a great community. keep it up i love you guys"
5-star,1,"the barre where everyone knows your name! unlike a group fitness class at a big box gym where you can get lost in a crowd, re-barre instructors are very attentive to each person. i've been coming to this studio for over two years and i am in the best shape of my life thanks to alyssa and her team."
5-star,1,i've been coming here since the fall and can't say enough good things about it. i've been to many gyms and done all sorts of classes from pilates to bikram yoga and nothing has transformed my body the way re-barre has. the instructors are all wonderful - of course i have my personal favorites but honestly they are all great - and they mix things up enough to keep it interesting. it is easily the single most supportive fitness environment i've ever been a part of. well worth the membership cost for that alone.
5-star,1,"this karve studio is really welcoming and the energy is great! i'm glad a close friend convinced me to buy this groupon with him, because i finally got to try a karve studio out! my friend and i tried our first class here last saturday and really enjoyed our time here. he's done the dailey method before. i've done the bar method and pure barre and i really enjoyed this one. the instructors told me that karve is more similar to bar method, and i agree, but this was the perfect mix because although i was pushed and encouraged to have great form and work hard, i didn't feel like a drill sergeant was yelling at me. michelle was a great motivator and made the class fun! with a previous history of ballet, it is fun to be back in a class where i can use the bar again and whip muscles back into shape that i forgot i had. i'm not one to work on flexibility myself, so it takes classes like these and yoga to help gain more flexibility and motivate me. i was told i wouldn't sweat much, but i did! even though just the tiniest movements are made, pulsing at the point where your muscles begin to shake can be really tough work and tiring. you know you're getting results though. you feel it. you feel your core getting stronger and you feel your muscles working to the point of exhaustion. like another reviewer said, it's super addicting, because you love the way you feel at the end and are all smiles when walking out."
5-star,1,"i've been ""karve-ing"" for 2 years now and i love it! i think it's such a great workout, especially for women, although my husband finds it equally as difficult. i don't like a lot of the high-impact, lose-your-breath workouts so this is perfect for me. i get toned in all the right places...booty lifted, arms sculpted, thighs shaped. even after 2 years, the workout is never the same and i actually get excited to go work out!"
5-star,1,"i've been coming for over a year and i still really love it! you'd think that it would start to get boring after taking a hundred classes or so - but, nope! they keep adding new and interesting elements that keep it fun and challenging. i have noticed a marked difference in my strength and posture. muscles are definitely tighter and firmer. (and, there is a huge sense of accomplishment when you finally successfully do pretzel!) this is a great workout. try it . . .you'll like it!"
5-star,1,"as someone who does not like to work out but trying to get my body together, karve is perfect for me. i was never motivated with the gym. i took dance classes consistently growing up and loved the results they brought. i had great form and my body was in shape, and plus dancing is fun. karve brings the focus of ballet from your past with being in perfect form and alignment in your mind throughout the workout. when you do things correctly you get great results. beyond knowing that being consistent with this will show results rather quickly, all of the women at this studio are so kind and welcoming. additionally, the instructors are also motivating and fun. even in pain from the workout you will find yourself laughing at some joke they have made. additionally, they now have zumba as well to add cardio to your workout regimen. this is such a fun class and one that for me does not have all of the focus that is necessary during a karve class. even though i am sore today from the 9am class i will definitely be back tomorrow to feel the burn, smile, and laugh with the next workout. love it!"
5-star,1,i really appreciate this studio and the lovely people who make it such a positive place. its a fantastic supplement to my yoga practice. alyssa the owner couldn't be more kind and supportive.
5-star,1,"i discovered karve north scottsdale just over 3 months ago and i was immediately hooked. for many years i have had an on again off again relationship with p90x and the belief that working out at home was enough. even during my most disciplined times, nothing has been more enjoyable or transformational than karve. at the time that i took my first class, i had not worked out regularly in almost a year so to say i was out of shape is an understatement. by my 10th class, i was already seeing results! the instructors are fabulous. each one has their own personality and flair that they impart into class which keeps it entertaining, exciting and incredibly challenging. i do my best to mix up the days and times that i go just so i can experience each of them but each of them also changes up the basic workout regularly so it is never boring! these classes are not for the faint of heart but don't t be intimidated. check it out for yourself. your fellow classmates will be friendly and inviting. the instructors are wonderfully clear in their direction and will assist you. additionally, they encourage modification to meet you level of comfort, knowledge and fitness so you are safe from injury and destined for great results!"
5-star,1,"first of all, i'm a grandmother who works at a desk all day! i thought i'd better get off my butt and exercise or i was going to become one of those ""little old ladies"". not! so i decided to try karve. it's amazing. the instructors are all so very friendly, and they truly care that your form is correct. they encourage all class members, no matter what their abilities might be. i've been going for 3 months, and i can really see progress being made! i've so grateful that i found this place,. if you're looking for a truly amazing workout, join the ladies at karve north scottsdale! i'm so glad i did."
5-star,1,this place is awesome! got my ass seriously kicked... i was visiting in scottsdale and decided to try it out and now i am hoping they open one on los angeles!!
5-star,1,"i love rise nation! the workout is so challenging and i am always drenched in sweat when i'm finished, but the music and dancing lights really help distract you and get you through it! i love that it is only 30 minutes. as a new mom, i can be in and out and still get a tremendous workout. the instructors are all high energy. i highly recommend the versaclimber if you are looking to burn fat with a high intensity and low impact workout. it is pretty pricey, but almost every group fitness place in cleveland is these days. they do run several specials a year though, so i always wait for those."
5-star,1,"full body workout in a matter of 30 minutes, what more could you ask for in a group fitness class in the heart of any city? rise nation is not just a workout class, but a way of living. continuously challenging yourself to strive and rise up both mentally and physically. the versa climber is a 0 impact machine, which is excellent for all alike. each time i leave a class, level one or two, i am ready to take on the day, after i shower, of course. because let me tell you, do not let the 30 minutes full you because you will be climbing more than you realize. no worries if this is your first time, the coaches are extremely helpful and will walk you through the steps on how to use the machine, what your goals are, and other imperative information. great news for you newbies, your first class is free and they have a killer ""first timer"" deal on classes. coming from a group fitness gal, i love this place and highly recommend it to people that are just getting back into working out or my fellow veterans out there that are putting in the 4-7 days a week of fitness."
5-star,1,"holy s***, i've found the most intense/enjoyable class in cleveland. i've been to spinning classes, dance classes, piyo, boxing, -you name it; and this morning i experienced rise nation. i. am. in. love. now i am by no means super athletic. but i enjoy a good work out class. and this class did not disappoint. i took dans introductory class at 11:15. and i'll be honest, i was tired during the warm up!! but as the class went on, i fell in love. dan led an up-beat/exciting class and by the third song (you go to the beat of the music) i was in the groove and felt like a badass. (thanks dan!) i'll definitely be coming back. and bringing friends. this place is incredible."
5-star,1,"this place is awesome! visiting from out of town and i love it! not your average fitness class. it's like the healthy version of a night club. great music, great instructors that keep you motivated and keep you going. i hate running and cardio because it's so hard on my knees. this is perfect whether you're new to fitness or an experienced trainer. short but intense 30min. can go on your lunch break or on your way to or from work. i die almost every time i go but i'm always excited to come back for more. class prices are great for first timers. and very fair even for frequent returners. towels available during class and clean showers at no extra charge. i wish we had a gym like this in toronto. derek has done an amazing job bringing this gym to life. highly recommend his classes but also this gym in general. proud of you d!"
5-star,1,"pros -full body workout. i could feel muscles that i didn't even know i had in the first 5 minutes of the class! if you do it, right you will give your legs, arms, and abs a sweat fest. -30 minute (intense) classes. i love that you get such a great workout in just half an hour. i won't lie, it is intense, but the instructors encourage you to go at your own pace. -similar to spinning. i love love love spinning and this was just like spinning, only standing up. everything was to the beat of the music, you can change your resistance, and like the studio i go to, everything was in the dark (kinda...there were really cool electronic lights that were on and off throughout the class) -location. located around the corner from my favorite place downtown, heinen's. so after i burn all those calories, i can pop in there after class and gain them all back :p -free class! your first class is free! and there's a sweet deal on a class package for newcomers should you continue your climb. cons -pricey workout. it definitely is up there as far as class prices in the cleveland area go. however, the bigger the package you buy, the better the deal. and hey, you can't put a price on your health! -needed more guidance. so everyone was very friendly there, but being my first class, i was thinking the intro to the space and the walk-through of the machine would have been more thorough. maybe i just caught them on an off day. or maybe some of this is absorbed after more classes. bottom line -i'm starting at the bottom, but will work my way to the top in no time!"
5-star,1,"i drove 25minutes because of the positive talk i kept hearing about this gym...& it's all true! this was not only the best 30 minute workout, everyone was very nice and helpful, & encouraging. the place has a great vibe. you definitely should try it."
5-star,1,"as someone who is heavier and trying to lose a decent amount of weight, i was surprised how comfortable i felt in the gym! the instructor i had, jovana, was extremely kind and knew how to help you with form without embarrassing you. the class is dark with colorful lights which puts you into 'another world' making the workout go by quickly and in a fun way. also, i took things easy, and stopped when i had to without embarrassment because of the dark room and because everyone was so into their own workout and watching the instructor. i love how the movements correspond with the music, so even if you have to stop for a second, you can easily get back into it. and it was so quick! i felt like i got a really good workout while not sacrificing my schedule. i will be back. 100%"
5-star,1,"not just the best workout in 30 minutes, the best workout period! brand new location and getting better every day. the official opening is set for sometime in september i am told but it is fully functional and the staff and class instructors are great. the studio is super clean and there is always a fresh towel provided on each climber at the beginning of the class (you'll need it!). if you want to try it, i would suggest looking at some of the videos online before you head in just to get an idea of the movements. the staff and instructors are right there with you to make sure you are comfortable on the machine (versa climber). throughout the class there are verbal cues as to what movements to do and a countdown in tune with the music to change movements. the classes are set up in levels and have similar sequence of movements throughout the 30 minute workout. after a class or 2 you really get a hang of things and are more comfortable pushing yourself and working on your form through the class. this is a group workout gym and you register online using your phone app or online. there are multi class deals. ******** ok so outside of all the introductory stuff, this is a great class with fun/motivational music and enthusiastic instructors. the ambiance is great to focus and motivate with an awesome lighted ceiling that is interactive with the music. once you come a couple of times and try out the different instructors you can get a feel for the type of music and tempo you like. i have not found one instructor that i did not like, even if the music wasn't my personal taste. i have tried cycle and group training classes, and while i enjoy them and find their uses, this class is my favorite. i burn about 15-20 calories per minute in a full body workout without impact on my joints. this is a very addictive class and i find new ways to challenge myself every time."
5-star,1,"best workout ever. i had a spine surgery years ago so most workouts end up causing me from back problems, but this one didn't strain my joints. i have been back multiple times and will keep referring my friends- it's just so fun!"
5-star,1,amazing workout with an amazing staff. completely different than anything else i've tried. try it out - you won't regret it!
5-star,1,"richmond hill location's closed for renovations so i've been coming here. what a pleasant surprise! counted 2 power racks (yas) and 1 smith machine, all durable and easy to set up. none of those shitty safety pins that break your fingers every time you reach for one. their treadmills are a little close to the tv's, maybe to discourage passive exercising, but there's plenty of them so nothing to complain about. i also found various leg machines that are actually useful, and brand-new plates and barbells that feel ergonomic. this crowd seems to be more into serious lifting too, as opposed to the baby boomers and teenagers you'll find at other snap locations. unabashed video making and squatting contests run galore and are almost intimidating. weekday afternoons are nice and dead until 3pm rolls around and then everyone shows up, but on the upside there are some ig-worthy looking people. the only downside is they don't have a studio, or much of a spot for training and calisthenics. the punching bag is also located right in the middle of the gym so everyone can watch you live out your mma streetfighter fantasies. there are also plenty of mirrors from all angles, especially around the power racks, to satisfy your inner narcissus. it can't get better. another downside is they only have 2 bathrooms which double as changing rooms, which could prove socially awkward during busy hours. the plaza does look sketch even by torontonian standards, which makes the pothole-ridden but ample parking lot fun during the day, but a crime movie setting at night. overall though, given the selection of equipment here, i'm a fan."
3-star,0,"i've been going to snap for quite a while now roughly a year. this gym isn't a bad gym, but isn't a great gym either. couple good things about this gym is 24/7 tap gym. decent size place and offers some xtr equipment. plenty of treadmills and some are quite high end. good price and tap card works at any snap fitness. some bad things about this gym is that it's limited in equipment and machinery. limited in weights/plates and bars. very few locations available and if some are close to you awesome! i would have to say it's hard to workout here unless you know what times to go where there aren't too many people working out. this can be good for you or bad depending if you workout or not. pros as you can use whatever you want whenever. cons being if you are new it can be hard to just up and start working out without some guidance and usually people are nice enough to tell you if it's harmful for you."
4-star,1,"love this snap fitness! you'd never know how great it is because it's located in such a sketchy plaza and you can't see inside unlike the other snap fitness in richmond hill. it looks run down and beat up from the outside but when you go in, the equipment is all very new and the machines are pretty unique. again, no showers. that doesn't affect me because i hate showering in public places.. gross. the changerooms are singular and work more as a bathroom as well. no complaints here, it's very similar to anytime fitness on woodbine/16th except larger. there's only 2-3 bars here, and not enough plates. they should stock up on 45lb plates- not everyone is new and can only squat a plate. they're scarce in this area, and clips .. hell no, i'm not attempting any power clean prs with no clips! i like the machines here, they're maintained very well and they have stuff that a lot of gyms don't have! 1. olympic rings hanging from the ceiling- that is something you don't see a lot. love this, great for core workouts! 2. waterrower row machine - omg it's so oldschool, it doesn't turn on but it's basically an old school machine with actual water in the engine. love! cardio for days. 3. woodway treadmills - these are amazing treadmills, if you have the opportunity to try them, do it!! it makes me feel like i'm not even running. easy peasy kilometres. 4. spin bikes - love! favourite form of cardio for sure. high intensity interval training - check! 5. battle ropes - omg!! amazing for workouts! love this gym, if i lived closer, i'd be at this location all the time. i don't mind venturing out of my way for this gym though. however .. people here need to learn to rereack their weights."
5-star,1,"its a basic gym, but has everything you need to work out. has some nice cardio equipment & nice weights. yes, there is no shower, but thats why its a basic gym with only the essentials, and that works to keep costs down and fees low. there are some tvs too which is nice. they give you a pass card that you swipe to get in, and you can come any time you want, 24/7/365. thats really the best feature here, there are no off limits hours or days, you can come on holidays, stat holidays, whenever you want. the owner is a nice guy that takes time to get to know the clientele. he will treat you fair, and wont rip you off. hes usually there during the day, so if there is any billing issues (which there are not) he is always available to discuss (unlike some if the big name gyms in the area which will rip u off any chance they get). i like this place allot. i come regularly, and will probably continue to renew my membership when it expires."
5-star,1,"i love that snap fitness is open 24/7. there is an assortment of different equipment and there are neat features such as trx suspension training. the owner pre is a really reasonable and down to earth person. he runs a great facility and you can tell that he cares about his business. i haven't used a personal trainer but i have observed their interactions with their clients and they are professional and motivating, especially anthony. it's a great place to work out."
3-star,0,"as other's have stated, ther'es no shower, which can be a pretty big pain point if you're just slipping in a workout and not near home. they do have a full set of dumb bells, but *very* little free weights outside of that. no squat rack, bench, or anything. there is a bar you can use for cleans or deadlifts, but overall it's fairly limited. but if you're the machine kinda gal or gal you'll be fine(machine's as in you use machines, not that you are a machine. or maybe you are a machine, or not, but on machines... you know what i mean). one thing they do have here which is neat, are ropes. not for pull ups, but for waving up and down... so that the rope looks like a snake... or a wave... you know, that arm workout thing you see elite athletes do... ya, i have no idea what it's called... can we just call it ""the rope""? the ropes bump this from a 2 star to 3 star, since i haven't seen ropes at any other gym. they also have two punching bags, which you can use to punch, kick, body check, hug, or kiss, 24/7!"
1-star,0,"well, it's been a year since my last review. i was hoping to relax in a nice pool....no such luck. the olympic pool is closed for members (unless you have paid for swimming lessons). the recreational pool is loud and full. on one previous occasion, a child dropped a deuce in the recreational pool. i can't bring myself to get it in it. why can't members use the empty olympic pool? the fact if the matter is that management sucks. they want your money, but don't care."
5-star,1,"my family and i have been coming here for about 6 months now. the staff is always friendly, the classes are varied and accommodating time wise. the machines are in good shape and seem to always be in working order. a good variety too."
4-star,1,"it's been over a year since my last review and i'm pleased to say that this y has improved greatly. i especially would like to call out devon, the operations director. after hearing about what was happening she made time to meet with me and thoroughly apologized for the rude customer service we had received. one thing that frustrated me is that the the problems our family was having was never sent up to her. i actually didn't even know who she was when she wanted to meet with me. i had met with another employee prior to this who conned me into thinking they were essentially the head honcho at this branch. anyway, it was surprising to see the turn around that happened and how apparently this was all due to miscommunication. an awful case of it, but i am glad it was cleared up and that devon made it right."
1-star,0,"worst worst customer service over the phone ever, no patient answering your questions what so ever! having attitudes! that's not what i think ymca should be! it has come down to my heart!!!"
1-star,0,"if you plan on having your child having swim lessons at southwest ymca, especially the one on one, i would be cautious. my child's swim instructor was extremely unpredictable and unreliable. i would say 4 of the 8 swim lessons the swim instructor called in sick. one time we agreed on a different day to meet for a swim lesson the instructor forgot. it got to the point that i would email the swim instructor the night before to make sure we would still have a swim lesson. i had emailed the instructor the night before she said she would be there so before we left she called 15 minutes prior to cancel the swim lesson. i would say this experience has made us decide not to continue swim lessons at the ymca. no professionalism, no reliability, pure amateur. it's frustrating because you make plans around these swim lessons and when the swim instructor can't be professional, as in showing up, then it just makes you very weary every time there is a lesson. will she be there or will she not? also while your child is trying to have swim lessons, in a particular spot for swim lessons that does not even indicate it, of course you will have loads of people coming into the pool from that section, other kids, scuba divers, people who don't have a clue a swim lesson is taking place, because there are no signs indicated. it's hard for a child to focus with such commotion. if i could give this review a zero i would. the only thing i like about the ymca is the zumba and being able to swim in the olympic pool, when it isn't closed. the place is run by unreliable, unprofessional, amateurs, who don't give a fig about your time and money. the staff up front are professional and courteous."
5-star,1,"everything i was looking for in a gym. good gym, not crowded at peak hours (like lifetime and eos), offer military rate. they clearly tell you upon signing up exactly how you'll be charged and how to cancel. and they post a swim schedule so you don't show up and find all the lanes in use. these ratings bashing costumer service seem to come from someone trying to solve contact issues with the desk workers. if you have a real issue they have very knowledge people to talk to, i just had to schedule a meeting with one and wait a day. i guess people get bent out of shape when the front desk can't instantly help them. that being said the pool is one of the nicest around and with the mil rate for pool and gym you can't beat it."
1-star,0,my kids just started summer camp here and so far i am not pleased. the lack of organization and supervision is really scary. this facility will nickel and dime you. they claim to make their services affordable for everyone. certainly overpriced for what little they have to offer. it is very unfortunate that there aren't many other options in this area for camp/childcare for school aged children that doesn't cost an arm and a leg. overall very disappointed.
1-star,0,"we have been family members for 10 years. i rarely went and there were many reasons for that. 1) class times are very limited and very crowded. 2) there is nowhere to change your kids, especially if you have infants!! you aren't allowed to use the women's locker room, which would be much better. instead you have to use the ""family"" changing room, which is anything but designed for families. you have to lay them on the floor to change them. when i went with my older girls (5 and 7), there isn't anywhere to put anything! no counters, tables, benches, or chairs to lay out dry clothes or put down wet swim suits and towels. it's just awful!! 3) class times are very limited and crowded. 4) they close early, so if you wanted to go after you put your kids to bed, too bad! 5) i just cancelled my membership and due to the 30 day cancellation notice and the timing of my cancellation, i am paying for 2 months after i cancelled the membership!! totally unacceptable!! i am happy to cancel this membership and have been wanting to for years. there are so many better gym options out there. for an organization based on young people and families, that history is not reflected in this location."
2-star,0,"the pool staff used to be good, i felt safe swimming there because all of the guards were in shape. now everyone that seems to work there is fat or tiny, no one that could pull out a 200 pound man or woman from the bottom of the pool. the management is a mess. ymca's are in all a very cheap organization. overall i'd say put your money somewhere else, this ymca is not worth your money."
1-star,0,"they have rude staff. my friends and i wanted to get a snack out of the vending machine after a long workout. they told us that we could not be there because we did not have a membership, even though we recently purchased one. the workout center is dirty. i was not happy with my experience."
1-star,0,"if i could give 0 stars, i would! we used the summer day camp program for one week, and it was beyond awful. children were not properly supervised, activities were not age appropriate, and proper licensing guidelines were not followed. children were allowed free reign while not being provided engaging activities or materials thereby creating a recipe for disaster. the ""director"" was unprofessional and not qualified for her leadership position. her counselors were technically in the room with the children, but nor ""present"" in their supervision. i would recommend that no one use this summer camp or after school program."
1-star,0,"the southwest valley ymca in goodyear absolutely sucks in customer service. i understand that most are young students working part time, but they are in great need of training to greet with a smile, multi-task and deliver common courtesy to members. it's common to feel like you are disturbing the employees when you approach them during check in and if you have questions. it's almost like you owe them something. once this year's membership expires, we will explore other options unless the staff performance improves. the majority of the staff have terrible attitudes and i do not recommend the southwest valleyymca in goodyear to anyone."
3-star,0,"i joined this y hoping for a great spirit of community, but it was lacking for me. also, if you like group fitness, this place is not for you. there is only one exercise room, and the ac is really noisy, so you will not relax if you are taking yoga. no basketball, indoor swimming, etc, and their kids schedule for kids over five doesn't start until 3pm. what if you homeschool? there were a few good classes, but only a few. the rest are senior classes. all in all, i left last month, and it was a good decision."
1-star,0,i couldn't be more frustrated with this facility. we went here to avoid that big gym feel and this place is equal too or worse. first don't get sucked in by the pool because the kids pool or slide is not open often enough or during times you could use. the lap look is always booked or full so if you want to take the kids swimming this isn't the place. they have a cool rock wall but no one is there to let you use it. the kids area is not appropriately staffed and the check in process is very insecure. say you decide you don't want to use the gym anymore? good luck canceling. you jump through loops designed to stop you from canceling and still they misplace your file and harass you for the bill you canceled. at $92 a month you can get alot better. avoid at all cost because i'm still dealing with their billing mistakes.
1-star,0,"we were offered a promotional deal through my wifes employer a few months back to have my family join the ymca. the promotion was good and i use to work at this location the first 3 years when it opened as a fitness instructor. so i was excited about joing the ymca family and being part of the amostphere again. sadly it has been nothing but bad experinces since we joined. long slow waits to get checked in for swim braclets or even scnanned to work out in the gym. the young staff at the front desk area seem to be immature and display lots of horseplay. the admin staff continue to have our name spelled wrong and phone number entered incorreclty in the system. after 3 times of searching for me in the system i did get frustrated why the corrections where not made? especially after they said sorry and told me the changes had been made each single time i went through this process. the kicker was signing my daughter up for swim lessons for the summer only to find out a week later she would not be able to comitt to them due to changes with travel. with more than a weeks notice before swim class started i cancelled the class. i was told i should recieve the refund in 5-7 buisness days. lets just say it took over 4 weeks, and if i had not followed up on the matter throughout the month it would have been forgotten. very dissapointed in the customer service and buisness skills that this ymca provides to its members. it seems very regular from my personal observations that members seem to be complaining at the front desk. use to be an a+ organization but now it gets a failing grade. i would not recommend this gym."
2-star,0,"i recently moved here from co. i was a member at the ymca of boulder valley and was very happy. so, fast forward 5 months and i'm looking for a gym. the y was an obvious choice to check out. i took a tour at approx 10am on a monday. the place was fairly busy, but not overcrowded. the staff were all friendly and the facility seemed great. the child watch area was great. the child watch staff were playing with the kids. this is what i expect at the y. when it was time to talk about price, the outgoing and friendly tour guide got shy. i knew something bad was coming because the extroverted young lady seemed embarrassed. well, now i know why. $70 a month for a single membership, plus $100 reg fee! even she wasn't willing to turn that positive. she knew they had a great product, but was embarrassed that the y charged so much. as a former member, she was going to try to snag me a better deal. however, i haven't heard back yet. ymca staff, if you read this.. understand that you have the most expensive gym in the area. even lifetime fitness mall and spa have lower rates. come on! golds gym is a great facility (less amenities, i know) right down the street, i could buy 7 basic memberships there for what you are charging. seven! this rate is 40% more than what i was paying at the ymca of boulder valley and they had an ice rink! which is very expensive to operate. i could afford to come join here. however, at the end of the day, i have a duty to my family to be financially responsible. it would be irresponsible of anyone to pay you more than everyone (i mean everyone) else in town. sad."
5-star,1,"this is a very nice, family-friendly, gym. we love it that they have a nice kiddie pool with a slide, plus the olympic pool for more serious swimmers. but best of all, is the child care... i wouldn't be able to go work out without taking my kids with me, so it's a super plus that they have such dedicated team to care for the little ones, while we try to get in better shape, or better our health. the ladies at the child care in the morning shift rock!! kim and olga are very dedicated to their job, and the kids feel at ease with them."
3-star,0,over all 3 stars ! my massage girl was not very good . the spa is very nice & beautiful ! i will go back again in the future! make sure use your m life card to book :)
4-star,1,"my perception upon arrival was impressive. until i went into the waiting area prior to my massage appmt. i have never witnessed the spa staffs were chatting so loud among themselves non stop at the counter. hopefully the rest of my experience will justify my time.. after 80min of one of the best massages i had, terra totally helped to redeem the level of expectation. i am satisfied with my experience here!"
5-star,1,"i really liked and enjoyed the red carpet facial at the aria spa. felt very refreshing and relaxed, and my skin felt so much better: firmer, moisturized, and radiant. gina is an amazing esthetician and is very knowledgeable, social, friendly, and funny. i am so happy to have met and talked to her. the facility was also beautiful, nicely designed. the staff was very professional and friendly."
4-star,1,"le barber shop se situe dans la zone spa de l'hotel. le lieux est magnifique. il n'y a qu'un siège dans le local, donc prenezbrendez-vous au près des concierges pour réserver une place."
5-star,1,"salt room, hot stone bed, eucalyptus steam room, cedar sauna, indoor hot & cold jacuzzi baths and a coed outdoor pool... i'm in spa paradise! but wait, it goes full throttle with a 50 minute revitalizing massage from jessie! plan to spend a bit more if you prefer exceptional service. the massage cost me $180 plus a $40 tip and a few extra bucks for the superb service by the attendants. oh and i have to mention that most rooms and areas will have citrus water, teas, bottled drinks, fruits and healthy treats. all toiletries were provided as well. no need to bring anything except a swimsuit but only if you plan to use the outdoor pool. this is the place to be after your crazy vegas nights"
2-star,0,"it was my first no last visit to their salon. sadly it is all because of one manicurist. and i called numerous supervisors left a few messages for the manager to please call me. a week later, still no call. my pedicure was going wonderful, front desk girls were friendly, and helpful. actually one of the best service i received so far at the aria. until,.. a manicurist who was across from where i was getting my pedicure done turns around and gives me the filthiest look. now needless to say i had no idea why, for the next 20 min she continued to actually turn completely around and away from her client to glare at me. now there were only two of us getting services, myself and the mean manicurists client, so it was me she was glaring at. i felt intimidated and nervous and wanted out of there. i can't even remember what my girl was talking about as i was wanting her to hurry so i could leave. i didn't even sit around and wait for my toe nails to dry. i asked the receptionist what the girls name was and for her managers card, paid and got the heck out of there. i have never, and i mean never been scared while getting my nails done. and as long as that woman works there i will never go back. i always do spas when in vegas and usually go to the wynn, canyon ranch at the venetian, the mandarin, encore, but was looking forward to the aria. tamika made it a awful experience. and if it were not for her i would have definitely returned. we are going back to the aria in april and i will be going to the encore for my spa days along with my two daughter in laws. i really think management needs to call clients back especially when they have been told there was a problem. what a shame."
5-star,1,"the spa attendants were very friendly. one even came in the sauna to hand us iced towels. jen remembered us and reminded us when our massage was coming up. brandon performed my massage. it was great and i felt very comfortable. he noticed my robe was too long and he got me a smaller robe. super professional. my friend and i enjoyed the hot stone room, jacuzzi, and sauna. i think the prices are fair for the services and amenities. we will definitely be back!"
4-star,1,i had a invitation from aria hotel when they opened many years ago. i stayed at the aria hotel and spend time in spa when they opened first week..very good experience. always gym and spa is my favorite and top priority. i like modern contemporary style entrance and spa was amazing. i would definitely recommend it!
5-star,1,"giving 5 stars because of the end results. lacey styled my hair (voluminous curls/waves) five hours ahead of going out and it held all night into the next day (somehow without feeling like helmet head too). i have fine hair, so this is basically a miracle. sky gave me a classic manicure and, as someone who is very active and has nails eternally prone to chipping, i could not be more satisfied three days later. beautifully shaped and perfectly intact, best manicure i have ever received."
5-star,1,"this place is incredible!!!!!!!! i had a massage from stacy. she's amazing!!!! the whole staff was very helpful, nice, and informative."
5-star,1,"loved this place. my husband and i got the couples massage for our 4 year wedding anniversary. the service was great from start to finish. upon entering the spa you receive a tour of all the extra areas you have access to. i loved the meditation room with the heated stone beds. amazing!! there's a vanity section with complimentary lotions, soaps, razors, etc. you can pamper yourself before your massage. there is a section with 3 jacuzzis in the all women area. all 3 had different temperatures. there's also a waiting area with magazines, drinks, and light snacks. the spa comes with a robe and slippers as you enjoy the amenities. my experience ended with the most amazing one hour full body massage. you get to pick the type of oils you want during the massage and you're left with a nice piece of chocolate at the end. you also have access to the amenities all day long. they also informed me locals get a discount monday-thursday which is 25% off. i didn't enjoy the rest of the hotel and casino, so the spa is the only reason why i'd come back."
5-star,1,"i spend all day here. this is my oasis away from all the toxins. i will come back every time i beautiful las vegas. beautiful spa, awesome customer service and very relaxing meditation rooms."
5-star,1,"aria's spa is refreshing in that it offers more co-ed relaxation options than most vegas spas. (am i seriously the only person on the strip who wants to relax *with* her significant other? i was surprised at how few co-ed spa options there are in vegas.) my fiance and i were able to relax together in a number of public spa areas including the outdoor plunge pool (the view is a little less spectacular than they make it out to be on their website, but i enjoyed that it was heated in the winter time), the salt room (the ergonomic leather chairs vibrate a little, and they are so amazing!), the warm granite room (loved the temp, but laying on a flat, hard slab of granite isn't too comfy) and in the quiet lounge. we indulged in a couples' massage and really enjoyed the ambiance of the luxurious treatment room. the faux fur blankets were a nice, cozy touch. plus: the massage tables were the most comfortable ones i've ever had the pleasure of laying on. only complaint was the scented massage oil: the oils were based on pinot grigio and red wine scents (laaaaame and didn't smell all that great.) i love aromatherapy, so i was a little disappointed that there were only two options, and they both sucked. in general, the spa at aria was nicer and seemed more well-maintained than comparable spas. i've been to pricier vegas spas, yet aria's was absolutely pristine everywhere you looked: new towels, new robes, clean and well-maintained spaces, furniture that looked ""like new."" and nary a hint of mold anywhere---that is a big deal to me. i felt like everything at aria's spa was clean. it was also super quiet and relaxing. nothing but grown ass people in there, which is refreshing since some of the other spas on the strip can get overrun by gaggles of partying youngsters."
5-star,1,"after an eventful weekend of dancing and partying for three days straight, my boyfriend and i knew a little r&r would do our bodies some good. since my boyfriend has an mlife player's card account, we decided that anytime we want to go to the spa, we would try a new location that is part of the mlife family until we knock them all out (minus excalibur and luxor because they are too shabby for our taste). since we were staying at vdara and we had previously tried out espa already; we decided to try aria's spa since it was just across the way. i requested a 3pm couple's massage appointment so that we could utilize their spa to the fullest especially the outdoor infinity ""therapy pool"". when we arrived the front desk receptionist warmly welcomed us and after signing paperwork directed us toward the elevators where we would go upstairs for the spa facility. the door to the men's/women's facility was so ""futuristic"" and cool! i was a little confused at first because there was no handle, but then i noticed there was panel where you have to wave your hand. it was almost like a secret passage way. pretty cool. the interior of the women's spa area was very spacious. the siting area had three television sets and several couches to lounge on. the facility had a nice spread of drink options such as tea, coffee, and, ginger ale, and fruit infused water. they also had things to munch on such as apples, pretzels, and a cracker mix. the women's facility area is by far the biggest one i have seen so far out of the mlife hotels. they have lots of shower/women's toiletries/ plenty of changing rooms/showers. after changing into the rob and slippers given to me i went to the co-ed waiting are to wait for our massage therapist. their waiting room is also the biggest co-ed waiting area i have ever seen. while we were waiting there one of our therapist greeted us and walked us in the direction of our couple's room we had requested. the room itself is very spacious, and has scents that are very calm and soothing. when in the room the therapist asked us if we had any specific areas we needed work on and then asked us which oil scent we would like used on us. we both loved our message therapist. they used just the right amount of pressure and were able to get the knots out that we had specifically requested they work on. after the massage the therapist waited outside for us to change and then gave us water and escorted us back to the main area and showed us the different facilities we could use. we first went to the ganbanyoku beds which are basically warming beds that you can lie for meditation or just to relax after a massage. it wasn't overly hot, it was a perfect warm temperature and the room itself was dimly lit, so the whole experience just soothes and relaxes you. after that room we went next door to shio salt room. the salt bricks on the walls as well as the salt lamps in the room make you feel very relaxed when breathing and sitting on the lounge chairs. finally, we proceeded to the outdoor ""therapy pool"" which is only accessible by going through the separate locker facilities and has an infinity pool affect that overlooks aria's day club and a partial city view. the pool is basically a bed co-ed jacuzzi, but still a very relaxing. i loved the ""therapy pool"" because it was so relaxing and soothing. it was very quiet that day because it was a monday so there wasn't anything going on at the dayclub (thank goodness) and the spa itself wasn't packed, so we basically had the pool to ourselves. while sitting in the pool, you tend to just hang on the edge of the infinity pool and feel very at ease. it was nice and made us feel like time stood still. but, i will mention that the pool area only has six loungers there and the rest are all wall seats, so if it's a busy day, don't expect to get a lounge chair. overall, our experience at aria spa was ""one for the books"". previously we didn't think that there would be a better experience than the time we went to bellagio's spa, but this place surpassed our expectations."
5-star,1,"the aromatherapy couples massage was divine! the spa itself was gorgeous, luxurious and inspires relaxation. in the massage room, you have a screen to choose the type of relaxing music you'd prefer. the massage therapists spoke to us individually about our massage preferences, and did an amazing job throughout the massage. it's probably the first massage that i've had where i don't feel pain, but just good pressure to get out all the kinks! after our massage, my hubby and i went to the co-ed salt room, and then to the long jacuzzi pool overlooking the aria pool and cabanas. the woman's spa room had a eucalyptus steam room (so amazing) and red cedar sauna. my hubby told me that the men's room had tvs showing the warriors game, which i thought was hilarious (he loved it) as the women's spa room didn't (i'm thankful for that). overall, a serene, beautiful experience that my hubby and i are considering doing once a year!"
4-star,1,"had a lovely day at the spa. the eucalyptus steam room was on point - very steamy and hot. the dry sauna could be hotter, it was just warm. jacuzzis were nice. the outdoor co-ed pool overlooking liquid day club was pretty nice, however, banging music from liquid did not give me that ""relaxing"" feeling i was looking for at the spa, so i did not spend much time by the pool. my husband and i enjoyed the meditation rooms... especially the salt room with vibrating chairs and soothing music. the spa provides plush robes, lots of towels at your disposal, hair dryers, shampoos, hair brushes, razors, etc. one note though, it would be nice if there was 'lower your voice' policy around the spa... some women were having super loud conversations, which takes away from relaxation."
5-star,1,love my make up done by kylie. she is a doll and so friendly. had my make up done along with two others for my sisters birthday night out in vegas. super happy with my make up and love the experience.
4-star,1,"had make up done here for a friends wedding. the service was great. the staff was super friendly and fun, everyone i saw in there looked great. these gals rocked it and seemed great at what they do!"
2-star,0,"**spa facilities review only** lets begin with how my girlfriend and i ended up here. long story short, during our second day in vegas, we went to qua bath & spa at caesars palace for a massage & spa day. we had such a good time, we went back to enjoy just the facilities since they were soooo nice. however, when we arrived, we found out that the day pass for the facility had gone up to $100 per person. they were really nice, but not $100/person nice... ) you might as well get a $100-$150 treatment). we learned that aria's spa pass was only $40 for non hotel guests, so we decided to check out their facilities... so here we are at the aria and the front desk person charged us the hotel guest price of $30. awesome! we go our separate ways, and through the gateway to relaxation... pros: - plenty of free beverage options (coffee, tea, various juices, water, etc) - nice robe and locker - co-ed pool was a nice meet up spot for you and your opposite-sex significant other - the room with the hot slab of stone to lay on (also co-ed) - steam room and cedar dry sauna - showers, plenty of hair products, razors, toothbrush, whatever you need to freshen up - jacuzzis were nice cons - the only bad thing about the place is... it's not as aesthetically pleasing as other spas like the drift spa at the palms or qua at caesars. this is a no frills type of place.... nothing will make you go ""ooooooh"" and ""aaaaahhhhhh"". you get what you pay for (which isn't anything to complain about)... it's just when you're fresh from another spa facility that was freakin amazing, it makes places like this seem kinda plain. dont get me wrong, the jacuzzis and saunas will melt away any stress you build up from the vegas strip. if all you're looking for is a hot tub, steam room, and sauna.. you can't beat $30. if you're going to drop $150-250 on a treatment, you're better off going to another spa that has much more enjoyable amenities and a better facility to enjoy before & after treatments."
4-star,1,"i spent a good 4 hours in this spa with some friends. it was worth every dollar of the $30 we spent per person! as soon as we walked in, there were cozy sofas, complimentary drinks and snacks, and a fire place for some relaxation. as you go in more, there are a ton of lockers to place your belongings. after we changed, we went into the hot rocks room, which is exactly what it sounds like lol. you lay down on a piece of hot rock :) then, we went into the himalayan salt room. this was soooo relaxing. i think i took 2 naps in here! and then, we went off to the jacuzzi outside, which overlooks the aria day club. this was a bit loud, so i recommend just going to the indoor jacuzzi if you want some peace and quiet :) and we finished the day off with some sauna time. overall very pleased with my experience here and will be coming back soon!"
4-star,1,"superb facilities! you feel like you're in another world when you step into the aria spa. i didn't have any experience in the salon so this review is mainly for the spa. i was pondering just getting the $30 day access (since i was an aria guest), but i splurged for a massage as well--a hot stone massage will run you about $180. for the day access, they'll give you a wristband so you can use the facilities till 8pm if you choose. things i liked about the spa: -sleek, minimalistic/modern facilities -easy check-in -professional and friendly staff that give you your space when you want it -lockers with codes you can setup yourself -spacious stalls in the restrooms and separate changing rooms/shower areas -complimentary sodas, juices, water, coffee, etc -hot stone bed room: this was different than i thought it would be. there are about 6 beds total in this room. the ""beds"" are actually just platforms with tiles that heat up when you lie on them. so you're essentially lying down on hard ground and using a bamboo mat as a pillow. not as relaxing as i anticipated. -himalayan salt room: room with walls made of sea salt--you sit in lounge chairs that resonate and vibrate to the music that's playing. each lounge chair comes with it's own set of headphone so you can get really lost in the music. this room is purposefully cold, i didn't see a noticeable difference in my mood or health, but it was kind of neat to experience. -eucalyptus steam room: this was fabulous....and they pump so much steam into the room so you can't see 5 feet in front of you. and you leave feeling like you got rid of all the toxins in your system. (unisex only) -sauna cedar room: i didn't get to try this one, but have heard good things. -three different jacuzzis with varying temps outside the steam rooms. (unisex only) -plenty of lounge chairs -separate co-ed area which i didn't try out"
4-star,1,"received a facial and body buff. the front desk was a little disorganized and didn't seem very knowledgeable about the different services. my services were very good, though. the spa itself is huge. i checked in early so that i could use the spa. the salt room and heated stone beds were unique. i liked that i could come back and use the spa till they closed at 8 that night, too. overall, a very good experience."
5-star,1,"by way of full disclosure, i haven't used the spa & salon services at aria - just the gym, which i hit daily. it's got a massive cardio set-up - i'd guess 18 treadmills, another 10 or so cross-trainers, plus about 8 recumbent and stationary bikes - so you never have to wait for a machine. there's a full circuit of weight machines and a good-sized free weights area too. the gym is one of the primary reasons i stay at the aria, helping to compensate for its shortcomings in other areas, which i'll address elsewhere."
3-star,0,"maybe i'm just not a ""spa"" person. i paid the $60 daily use fee for two people and chose this particular spot, because i read that it has the most co-ed areas. be forewarned, it is a long walk from the casino. the staff is very nice, and a lady gave me a tour of the facilities. we tried the heated outdoor pool first. it was quite relaxing, but i wish there was a place to sit by the stronger jets. there is a view of another pool area, but not much else. when it got dark, the water was very hot. the salt room was interesting. when i fist sat down on one of the chairs, it made a terrible racket! everyone in the room turned and looked at me. it was very embarrassing. also, there was a lot of trash on the side tables. it was a monday, and they weren't very busy. i thought there should have been more clean up. well, the people who go there should also be more respectful and throw away their trash in proper places, but whatever. i thought the music in the room was too loud. my headphones didn't work. overall, it wasn't really for me. the hot stone room was next. it was actually really hot. and hard. i get that it's a stone, but it was uncomfortable. the other people in the room were sleeping and even snoring, so i guess no one else had a problem with it. i dunno. it was a relaxing day. maybe if i had scheduled a massage or something, there would have been more things to do. otherwise, i'd choose to go to the regular pool. if it's the wintertime, it's probably worth it though. oh, and if you use the gym, it's doubly worth it."
2-star,0,"the staff here charged my card for the tip (as i requested), but when my girlfriend and i went for the massage, the staff informed me that the tip wasn't charged to my card. so afterwards i gave a tip only to find out later my card was already charged for the tip! so i actually gave the masseuse twogo generous tips due to their error! if you here be careful of the charges!"
5-star,1,"this review is just for the spa facilities. i haven't received a treatment here yet, but i did take advantage of their $30/day all access pass to the spa facilities and loved it. from the relaxing salt room, sauna, steam room, the stone beds to the outdoor jacuzzi (the size of a swimming pool) everything was super clean and nicely decorated. there's plenty of space for co-ed relaxing, as well as private male/female hot and cold pools to jump in to after a sauna/steam. this really is the perfect post hangover space to pamper yourself before another night of vegas debauchery!"
5-star,1,"my girlfriends & i go here every week. we have the time of our lives. the staff is friendly & more than accommodating. lots of little drinks & snacks. swimsuits are optional, but you get the plushest robe ever. the common facilities are very clean & comfy. if you are a fancy-pants type that needs someone to smooch your behind you are better off going to sedona or somewhere you are a big deal. this is the greatest most relaxing spa yet & the hot stone room is tha bomb."
4-star,1,"i really loved the spa at aria & cannot wait to go again on my next visit to vegas!! i found this spa during a promo in september during the vegas spa week! i received a $ 120 plus facial for $50 including the use of the spa for the day! i was in heaven! the attendant who did my facial was fabulous & even treated me w/ extra special products for my extra sensitive skin! i really felt she cared and gave me the best service! it was so relaxing just to lounge for the day at the out door cooed rectangular wading pool that overlooked the popular liquids party pool & to the left is a view of the large aria pool ( not a bad view!) the steam room was also quite nice along w/ the whirl pool spas in an open lounging area! i was surprised during a popular ""spa week"" that the place wasn't over crowded... it was so relaxing! oh! i have to mention the many hot and cold drinks available along w/ a variety of fresh fruit! the lovely white robes in every locker was a nice touch i enjoyed!"
4-star,1,"ahhhhhhh....this was my first trip to vegas that was not a blow-out girls trip. instead, i tagged along with my poker-lovin' travelin' man (after assuring him i wouldn't cramp his table style), so i had a decent amount of time on my hands during the day. cue spa day! i scheduled a 50 minute ashiatsu massage because i can't seem to find anyone who does them in atlanta and, if you really like deep tissue massage, there is truly nothing like it. the therapist massages you with his or her feet! and no, they're not just walking on your back like my parents had me do when i was a kid, they are truly *massaging* you with those footsies, while holding on to bars bolted into the ceiling. i just can't describe it properly - it's freakin' amazing. i generally say ""no preference"" when it comes to gender of the stranger who will be rubbin' away but had a mild moment of regret when my dude came to get me from the lounge - ewww boys' feet are yucky! wow, i got over that real fast. this is going to come across wrong, but that man really knew how to use his feet! the massage was over before i knew it, as they do, but the noon poker tourney had just gotten started, so i took my time and took full advantage of every single amenity that spa had to offer. the women-only wet area is like most - hot jacuzzi, cold plunge pool, and a small ""warm"" jacuzzi as well - as goldilocks would say, it was juuuuust right. eucalyptus steam room sweated saturday night right out of me and the redwood sauna gave my skin a glow. most ladies kept their swimsuits on, but a few free spirits went topless. the coed areas include the waiting lounge, a salt room, hot stone beds, and outdoor soaking pool overlooking the liquid lounge. salt room was totally weird - trekkie-esque lounge chairs and vibrating new age music. i was disappointed at first because i was expecting it to smell like the seaside, and instead it felt kind of cold and sterile, but stick around for a while - eventually you'll start to feel the effect of the salt cleaning out those sinuses. i'm not completely embarrassed to admit that my favorite part just might have been the sheer abundance of us weekly and people magazines casually lying about in each room...oh yes, sometimes i just adore being a girl!"
4-star,1,"i would have only given 3 stars but i was impressed at the amount of coed areas they offer. we really enjoyed the coed endless spa that overlooks the liquid pool area. it was really fun to people watch. on the downside, perhaps you may not find that booming club music and girls in skimpy bikinis are too relaxing. my boyfriend and i opted for the spa entrance in lieu of a treatment. it cost $30 per person and allowed us unlimited entry for the entire day. i was very surprised that once you look past the upscale decoration, the only thing the spa really offers is a steam room, sauna, jacuzzi and some relaxation rooms. if you're used to a mediocre spa experience then this one will probably really impress you. i've been to most of the high-end spas in vegas and this one just doesn't compare. you will be disappointed if you are expecting something like canyon ranch spa. they don't have any special showers with shower heads to reach all your parts like i've experienced elsewhere and the spa products (shampoo, lotion, etc.) are just average. i guess i just expected a little more from this level of resort."
5-star,1,"i was in pittsburgh for the weekend and came to the saturday open mat. first and most important the culture at this gym is spot on how you want your school. the gym is filled with humble, friendly killers. the level of jui jitsu is high and for an older practitioner most importantly safe. if i make it back to pittsburgh, i would definitely come here to train. the facility was clean & well maintained. the locker room had a shower, which is not a given at many bjj schools. they have a multitude of classes & open mats spanning all 7 days. the instruction must be very good as even the relatively new students roll very smooth. by the way there was no charge for coming to open mat and i would have gladly paid."
5-star,1,live in la but travel to pittsburgh several times a year. have trained here on my last two trips and can't say enough good things about it. i've done both the fitness classes and the boxing/muy thai. classes are great for both beginners and those with experience and staff is super friendly and welcoming. i will definitely be back on my next trip.
5-star,1,great training. great guys. hospitable and friendly. good for all levels. some amazing wrestlers to boot. i came into town on business and stopped by to train. they were very open to allowing me in. i will be going back on my next business trip.
5-star,1,"beautiful academy, large space, great instruction shows in the strong students. very welcoming to visitors for drop-ins. real lovers of bjj and the martial arts broadly. super friendly reception, helped me to get orientes quickly, made real effort to make me feel welcome and to make sure i had a good experience - which i very much did! definately will return, and really advocate for this excelent academy. check it out!"
5-star,1,"super late review but i was talking about jiu jitsu with some training partners and i remembered having visited this place about a year and a half ago. it was a little difficult to find if you're not from the area ( nondescript building on a small side street) but once you're there you will be impressed. the facility is super spacious and very clean. the locker rooms are pretty modern and well kept. there's even a small ""chill"" area with some tables for the non-participating type. the training was legit. vigorous warm-ups and kick-ass training partners. rest assured, there are no easy rolls here. i've visited bjj gyms all over the country and this is for sure one of the best ones out there. if i ever found myself in pittsburg for any extended amount of time, i wouldn't hesitate joining this gym. also, warren was a super nice guy!"
5-star,1,"spacious and clean facility, highly knowledgable and attentive instruction, friendly and respectful training partners, a real gem of a school in pittsburgh."
5-star,1,"i have been traveling for work for over ten years, during that time, i have done drop ins all over the world --- very rarely do i have an experience the same as i had this week at stout's. from the top, warren, to his brother, logan and all their team mates welcomed me onto their mats. his guys are down to earth, just plain old good guys. i do not often run into blue belts that can flow roll, these blues are solid. high level purple belts were a great roll. their browns are just tough, but fun rolls. everyone of them only went as hard as i wanted too. warren spent considerable time with me during class to breakdown and fix a position i was having problems with. i spent 20 minutes talking to warren at the end of class about his school, traveling, bjj, life......it was refreshing to see someone so selfless, that dedicates and shares his love for bjj with his students and the world. if your considering going to stout's, there is really no reason not to start learning today, you can't go wrong."
5-star,1,"i would say that if the idea of doing muay thai sounds like something you would be interested in, you'll very likely enjoy going to stout training. when i've tried to talk my friends into joining (i'm sorry i'm that guy), the biggest pushback is typically that although they are interested, they're not sure if they would fit in with their current fitness level. i have seen people come through at all fitness levels and with all body types. there are some people here who run through pushups, and some who need to pace themselves with modified ones. personally, i remember what it's like to be ready to welcome the cold embrace of death after just the warmup. but the instructors and the people here are super supportive and are really there just to work hard and have a good time. actually, the instructors are scarily good at knowing when to check up on you and to make sure that you're ok, and when to push you to harder. when i am successful at convincing my friends to try out a fundamentals class, they've always been incredibly positive in their reviews. also, the instructors here clearly show a deep reverence for the sport. i don't know what this specifically does for me, but i feel like this is a good thing. to address another big pushback i've heard from my friends when i've tried to convince them to join- as a college student, i know it's far from campus. also, having come from a college that constantly screams at you ""pain is temporary, gpa is forever"", i know what it's like to let the membership sit empty because time is sometimes too costly a commodity. trust me, i've gotten way too many of those ""we've missed you!"" emails they send when you haven't been to the gym in about ~2 weeks. but even so, i don't regret joining. it's worth it. this place is truly a community that is full of people that inspire you to dig deeper, be better, and hit harder. i can't promise that stepping into the gym will immediately feel like thanksgiving dinner with the family, but people are really friendly here and they're always super excited to see people come back. even though it's only been a year, i would say that my college experience would have been much poorer had my friend not first convinced me to step through the doors of this gym. and yes, to reiterate what my friend has said below, they were much nicer than the hot yoga instructors we met before joining. p.s. make fun of kru (be prepared to die for it though)"
3-star,0,"great environment for any level. great instruction. have no fear if you have never done anything before, the staff here is great and progressing you through the curriculum at the appropriate pace and against suitable classmates. that being said, be sure you are willing to commit for the long term, as the cancellation process can only be considered a clusterfuck at best. they try to shift the blame to the ""billing company"", but if that's the case simply use another one, there are many. not only do you have to waste your time writing a cancellation letter and make time to stop in for an ""exit interview"", but then you get hit with a month's cancellation charge on top of that. i didn't realize anyone in fitness related industries even practiced this anymore (as someone who works in the industry). and due to not having time during the hours someone was there to do said interview, i was charged for 2 months worth of classes in the meantime in which i did not attend even one. from what i witnessed during the interview, cancelling the automatic payments consisted of a few keystrokes which could have been done at the time of my initial cancellation request. hard to not feel the whole thing from a business standpoint is just a little shady. and i hate to write this because i really like the instructors and the quality environment, but the business end of things could use some work. all it does is fester resentment from the pov of the consumer through wasting both their time and money - the two most valuable currencies we have."
3-star,0,"the training is great and everything is great but beware of the contract and cancellation fee. i registered for a month with 85 dollar but the cancelation fee was 115 dollar which is silly. it was bad ending. however, after long exchange of emails, andy waived the cancelation fee because i was not in town during the end of the contract. i did not have to pay. i mean they still have good business negotiation and morality but their policy is bad. extra cancelation fee and you have to come for a 5 minute meeting before you cancel ! i thought this is a gym not a job !"
5-star,1,"warren, andy, mike, and cody are some of the most caring coaches i have met in martial arts. to them, the key to having a successful business is being a family. this shows as their focus on their students growth is paramount. follow their plan, make classes, and you will be successful in reaching your goal. having spent 25 years in wrestling you often meet great people, the same doesnt always seem to hold true for other martial arts. but at stout training pittsburgh, goodness is at their core. i was lucky enough to travel into town from new york city and north jersey and to learn from them for 3 days. they helped me more than i could have ever dreamed, i am looking forward to paying back the favor. jeff marsh, edge school of wrestling, hoboken, new jersey www.edgehoboken.com"
5-star,1,son's been training with coach mike and coach mark. awesome guys who genuinely care about their students. the fight team's devotion to their gym's youth is unsurpassed. the fact that the coaches compete is huge as it sets the ultimate example for the youth in how one competes honorably. it also sets the tone and work ethic in every workout.
5-star,1,"two weeks in doing muay thai fundamentals at stout: i'm really enjoying my training so far. i've always wanted to be comfortable with a martial art and muay thai at stout really appeals to me: class feels like i'm among colleagues of varying abilities, all of whom are willing to help me (a total novice) out with an air of mutual respect. i don't like the stratified authority--bowing to masters, etc.--that a lot of martial arts have. so the informal but rigorously structured makeup of muay thai classes at stout has been just what i'm looking for. most of my life i've been a physically fit person. i used to think ""eh, i'm tall and in good shape, i could handle myself in a fight"". two weeks here has, to my happy surprise, proved me wrong. my coordination, reflexes, and technique are all pretty bad (but are improving with every class). i'd like to keep improving these; i'd like to feel competent at self-defense. mostly i just enjoy learning things and getting a workout while i do. it feels good to get exhausted in the process of internalizing technique. i signed up at stout in particular because i was hoping for classes that make me feel comfortable and like i'm learning every time i come. so far that's how it has been."
5-star,1,"thanks to stout training, i find myself an unlikely convert to brazilian jiu-jitsu. i am a mother of 2 boys in my late 30's. i work full-time and have an extremely busy schedule. i am amazed to say that i have found a place i love to go and that i feel more fit, both mentally and physically, than i have in years. my initial goal was to find classes for my son. the instructors have been amazing with my high energy kids they are creative and enthusiastic and they have also clearly invested in learning teaching techniques appropriate for children at various levels of development. brazilian jiu-jitsu is an excellent choice for young children. the belt system is set up to provide regular encouragement and the instructors carefully explain to the class that stripes and belts are earned by hard work. stout training has a robust selection of classes for kids who are 5 and over and two classes a week for children as young as 3. i plan to get my second son involved soon and expect that both boys will be long-term members of this community. i felt so welcome that i decided i should get off the sidelines. i am not an athletic person. and i started this year at least 25 pounds overweight. i have known for a long time that i probably needed to engage in resistance training but honestly, i was completely intimidated by the idea of going to a gym. i imagined myself feeling very alone in a room of barbells with no idea what to do. i also imagined that it would be pretty clear to anyone else in the gym - that i didn't belong. after a month or so of bringing my son to class twice a week at stout training, i had a bit of an epiphany. i was honestly shocked at the warmth of the community at stout. of course there are a lot of very serious athletes here, both male and female, but there are also a fair amount of regular folks just trying to get healthier and a lot of parents and small children who all feel at home. it takes a pretty special place to foster such a welcoming tone with such a diverse range of people. kettlebells. honestly, the only reason i made it through the first month or so of weekly kettlebell class was because there is a beginners class at the same time as the youth jiu-jitsu program on tuesday nights, and if i was going to leave work early, i was determined to multi-task during that time. then there was a day, maybe 2 months in, when the instructor, will, announced that warm-ups would include 15 push-ups. i laughed a bit to myself, thinking that i hadn't done even one push-up from my knees in likely 15 years. but when i attempted my first regular push-up, i realized that kettlebells was working for me. i was able to do all 15 push-up - from my feet! kettlebells is a perfect way to build strength, because it really lets you start wherever you are. will is a fantastic instructor. he explains the techniques with clarity and patience and makes me feel like i will learn to do things i would have once said were completely impossible. jiu-jitsu. again, the first month of class was pretty rough. i didn't think i was going to make it through the very first warm-up. but the structure of the classes is great. you focus on drilling a technique with a training partner for most of the class and then you end with sparring sessions. i generally have either dean or warren as my instructor and, as with the youth program, it is evident that they are not only talented jiu-jitsu practitioners, but excellent teachers. i am starting to see huge improvements in my fitness. the callisthenic warm-ups have gone from torturous to breezy. and i love how i feel headed back to my office job after an hour of rolling. oddly, it isn't just the physical workout i enjoy. jiu-jitsu challenges you to take a deep breath when you are in a tight spot and think strategically about how to create some room to maneuver. this is a matter of mindfulness that easily transfers into my professional life. the results. i give stout training my highest accolades. before i found this community, i had a strong desire to find a way to be healthy, but very little hope. and now i have an exercise routine that i can honestly say i relish. i love to go to class. i love sharing this activity with my son. but the kicker is, at only 3 classes a week, i have dropped 10 pounds since the first of year, and i just bought new suits that are 2 sizes smaller than i was wearing at christmas. but beyond the weight loss, i have gained a new perspective about myself and what my body might be able to do. i am excited to imagine a life full of fun, physical activities with my boys."
5-star,1,"stout training has always welcomed us warmly to drop in and train there. the gym is very well located in the strip district and the setting is very neat - there's a slight loft-feel to it, which i like. the facilities are clean, from the matts to the locker rooms (men and women). the credentials of the instructors speak for themselves, so i'll just say that the staff was very chill and very gracious. i'd definitely recommend this gym to anybody who wants to train bjj in pittsburgh."
5-star,1,"this review is for a yelp get fit event. don't let the hidden location fool you. this place is located right next door to the thin man sandwich shop on the second floor of the building.. huge space! they have cubbies to keep your stuff, really nice bathrooms with showers and a new cage training room. i went for a kettle bell class. i honestly thought you just swung different level weights. boy could i have been more wrong. the trainers were more than patient with us and gave helpful friendly advice and the perfect amount of motivation and encouragement. we did moves on the floor, planks and some swings of the bells. it really is a great workout. i thought i would be intimidated at a training gym but the instructors are so friendly and welcoming. this is a great thing to do if you really want to get toned and gain strength."
5-star,1,"a review for yelp gets fit * january 11, 2015 i can barely move. the tops of my forearms hurt. is that even a thing? i've done a lot of workouts before and i swear the only time my forearms have hurt were the times when i was accidently scraped with a rapier during stage combat class. oh wait. my forearms did hurt during those classes. i think i blocked it out. anyway. there's the kind of pain that makes you cry and there's the pain that makes you smile. and this, my friendly yelpers, is the latter. for the second time in as many months, i attended a workshop at this fine establishment. this time organized by yelp's own kerri m. i felt secure in knowing that i wasn't the only novice in the room. that being said, renzo has one of the warmest (not literally - it was pretty chilly) environments of any fitness joint in the city. yesterday's workshop was taught by jarrett. jarrett is one solid dude. friendly and encouraging yet not patronizing - he really needs to visit the la fitnesses of the world and show'em how it's done. when he first explained the layout of the workshop i was a bit skeptical. we were to go through a brief warm-up, some mechanics of the kettle bells, then onto a 12 minute workout. ""12 minutes?"" i thought to myself; ""what can i accomplish in 12 minutes?"" yeah - 12 minutes was totally enough. i broke a real sweat for the first time in a long time and loved every second of it. there's something soothing about swinging a kettle bell. i can't explain, i just ask that you consider trying it someday. at the completion of our workout we were treated to some healthy fare courtesy of jarrett's wife, deena. she whipped up a selection of spinach smoothies, zoodles (zucchini noodles), kale salad and berried topped with fresh coconut cream. every bite was delicious and i can't wait to try the recipes. during our post-workout nosh, jarrett explained a bit more about the class offerings and i was hooked to the point of signing up for a 2-month transformation challenge before i left. my first class was at 6am today. while i can barely keep my eyes open right now and bending over at all is a supreme challenge, i couldn't be happier with my choice. stout training pittsburgh hosts workshops on a fairly regular basis. i highly recommended trying it out some day. what have you got to lose...except maybe a few inches? thanks kerri m. for organizing such an awesome event!"
5-star,1,"last year i became tired with not really doing very much in terms of physical activity after finishing a few years of rugby and almost ten years of wrestling i looked into starting brazilian jiu jitsu and mma. i quickly found out about warren stout and mike wilkins, two of the top instructors at stout training pittsburgh. everyone i talked to told me that if i was looking for good instruction with a fun environment then i should talk to them. last fall i started training at the old location in lawrenceville full time under warren and was very excited when i found out that we would be moving to the strip district of pittsburgh, pa which was a much closer location for me. i also found out how affordable training here is, if cost has driven you away from bjj or any other martial art, stout training pittsburgh is definitely the place for you. in addition the new location, which has been opened for a few months now, is a lot bigger, and has space for muay thai, mma, conditioning as well as many more bjj classes. if you are only a beginner or have never tried bjj before, you have to give it a shot! it is the best decision i have ever made! come check out the new location, you will love it! best facilities, best instructors and best environment! come join us on the mats!"
5-star,1,"i highly recommend stout training pittsburgh / team renzo gracie every time i hit the mats it feels like i'm at home. i am one of the first members to train when warren first opened up his academy in pittsburgh. it has been, and continues to be a tremendous experience. warren is a top notch instructor that is very compassionate with a seemingly intuitive approach, if there is ever any question or hesitation about a technique he will take the time and review it with you. i travel extensively and i have trained bjj all over the us and abroad and i can tell you that this is a top notch academy. we are so lucky to have you in pittsburgh! rob michienzi"
5-star,1,"lemme start off by saying that a man of my corpulence and physicality has never had an issue with laying ass-whoopings whenever i please! in fact, when i worked as a bouncer at a cici's pizza (to pay my way through college, obviously) i had the nightly pleasure of tossing wise-cracking fools outta the joint. them kids stealing breadsticks, smh! but when i rolled up to this dojo, let me tell you baby--i was impressed. these cats know how to scrap. and the head samurai warren stout is legit. i'll be he's secretly a brother--probably has vitiligo or something. my fat body got tossed around by all these wrestlers and jiu-jitsu guys, so i got mad respect for this joint. peace y'all--i'm out!"
5-star,1,"was visiting pittsburgh for a week and had the pleasure of training here. warren, andy and all of the students were welcoming and helpful. great bjj school."
5-star,1,"there are too many good things to fit in one review. this academy is top-notch! i've always loved brazilian jiu-jitsu and mma. i was actually looking for a judo place that was in the city when i happened upon the bjj gym though. when you first attend, you get a free, one-on-one lesson from one of the many instructors there. i had some bjj experience from the army so we were able to skip some of the intro stuff and focus more on positional dominance and transitions. i signed up and everything has been great. there are jiu-jitsu competitors there as well as amateur and professional mixed marital artists. no one there has an attitude, no one is trying to hurt you. this is one of the most respectful places i've ever been, besides training in the army. i did karate/american kickboxing when i was younger and the folks who attend this gym are so much more friendly and helpful. warren stout, owner, head instructor is super experienced in wrestling, bjj and mma. he's very approachable as is everyone who works there. you will be guided on how to gain the skills to learn bjj, compete in bjj or simply just protect yourself. there's also muay thai there. kru david reese is an experienced muay thai instructor. he lived in thailand for about 8 years and has had over 60 professional muay thai fights. he's won every major championship that you can win in thailand and now shares his passion for muay thai here at the renzo gracie pittsburgh jiu-jitsu and mma academy. i haven't done striking in 13 years and he's taken my decent karate roundhouse kick and turned it into a deadly 'thai kick'. he trains everyone like there going to fight. this is not a cardio kickboxing class. this is real muay thai taught by a real muay thai fighter/instructor. jarret teaches mma conditioning classes. theses are kettlebell circuits that are a great workout for anyone. women, don't be afraid. there are plenty of women in this class and i've personally had plenty of female friends show interest in this class. there's an mma techniques course taught by mike wilkins, pro fighter. he's a great instructor that takes the time to show everyone how to incorporate wrestling with bjj into mma. these are basic mma techniques that he is teaching as there are separate classes for the actual fight team. fight team is by invitation only. i wouldn't trade this experience for anything and i've learned so much more about my personality from this experience. if you ever get the chance to train here, please do. whether you're an aspiring competitor or just want a good workout, you will not regret it! parents, there are kids classes too!"
5-star,1,"the best in pittsburgh pa and probably the best in western pa for all thing grappling and mma. warren is a great teacher for all skill levels, whether you are a first time white belt of a world class brown belt, he will help you get better. check the website for classes that fit your needs and get on the mat!"
5-star,1,"an awesome jiu jiitsu club in pittsburgh. warren is a great instructor - he takes time to make sure you get the details. he's trained a lot with some amazing jiu jitsu players - rolles, renzo and daniel gracie. it's clear that jiu jitsu is a big part of life and probably will be until he can't do it anymore. we have a bunch of talented wrestlers, and a bunch of skilled jiu jitsu players (and a lot of overlap). we train gi and no-gi. i think this provides the club with a great mix of styles - the technical brazilian jiu jitsu skills and the phenomenal take downs and intensity of the wrestlers. it's a great atmosphere and an awesome place to train, if you're looking to improve your technique while increasing your fitness."
5-star,1,"i have a hard time encouraging myself to workout but this studio makes it easy for me to go to! it's always so much fun and i always feel great (sweaty, but great) afterwards!"
1-star,0,"tried this place also from a groupon since it was close to my house. as another member stated, their spinning class is sub par. they need to look at what their competition is doing. the bikes are older with no readings of your distance or resistance. they don't keep track of your calories burned or heart rate. i think people taking spinning for the first time will feel like this is a great place and people who have gone to other places will think studio 360 is 10 years behind with the competition. yes, you do stand the whole time and there is no bar weights to work your upper body. it is so dark that you have to be careful that you don't trip walking into the room. the only lights they have is a dimmer that is directly over the instructor (who's face is about 5 inches from the mirror) and 2 bars of purple neon that they turn on and off. there's no lockers to use so there is shoes and gym bags all over the floor in the front room. i had a lock and opened what i thought was lockers that we could use but when i opened it up, there was old clothes, towels and misc company items stuffed in all the lockers. they stop 4-5 times during a class...literally stop for a 20-30 second break. there's no talking, no biking, no music. people actually get off their bikes to go to the restroom. all other spinning places will require you to reserve a spot while this place accepts walk-ins. that should tell you something. i've never gone to a spinning class where people leave before the class is over either. a pro about them is that they are cheaper and one of the trainer had great music - i think his name was mike. not for me. doesn't give a good workout as other places (cyclebar and madison)."
5-star,1,"i am really not into cardio, but i've been coming to this studio for the last 6 years and am simply addicted. every class is a new challenge and my only goal is to keep going. the instructors are motivating and inspiring and it's always a great group of people that attend. this studio is unique and the classes are exciting and fun while actually focusing on a full body work-out and not just legs. enjoy!"
1-star,0,a key to having a successful business is staying current with the competition and adapting. my recommendation to studio 360 is check out your competition and adapt. the studio has potential to be great but it's classes are sub par compared to the competition.
1-star,0,"i decided to check out this spin studio because it's right next to my work and it's cheaper than a lot of other spin studios. when i walked in the girl was friendly and asked me if it was my first time, i explained to her that i take spin classes regularly but it's my first time at their studio. she told me to wait for her and she would show me how to use the bike so i told her again i've taken spin classes but it's like it went in one ear and out the other. she took me into the spin room and showed me how to use the bike (by now i had told her 3 times i already knew what i was doing) there were only a few other people in the class. i'm used to taking high energy spin classes and this was the complete opposite. the instructors bike is at the front of the room facing away from everyone so i literally could not tell what she was doing, it just looked like she did the exact same thing the whole class, the music was terrible, and every few minutes the instructor would turn on a black light for a minute and then turn it back off. there were a few times she actually took breaks and the lights came on and everyone stopped what they were doing, i've never been to a spin class where people stop in the middle of the class. also, the entire class you are supposed to stand... which makes no sense to me, it gets very repetitive and it's not good for you. i ended up just doing my own thing until the class was over, 2 of the other people in the class even left early. i do not recommend this place and will not be back here. i'll stick to taking classes at the madison, i would rather pay more for a fun high energy class!"
2-star,0,"bought a groupon recently to try out studio 360 just to see if this was a place i would continue attending after my groupon expired. the first day i walked in i didn't feel welcomed.. might have been because i bought the groupon, but would expect an establishment to treat me like any other customer. regardless.. i attended several classes since i love and appreciate a good spin class. the instructors never seemed to be high energy and the music selection wasn't for me. i even left class right when we got into the last cool down. the classes seemed low energy, and continued to feel like the long time clients were of more importance. the groupon should help build clientele and is a way for new customers to try out an establishment to see if they like it. i was not impressed."
5-star,1,"still my favorite studio of all time. nothing fancy or cheesy like all the newer studios. sam, by far, is the best instructor!"
5-star,1,"i found a groupon for a month of unlimited spinning for studio 360 and so far i love it. i didn't know how much i would like the ""drop saddle"" (standing most of the time) style but it works. even though it will be awhile before i can even begin to keep up with the instructors (who are great) and sort of have to go at my own pace, each time i wind up completely drenched in sweat by the end and my fitness tracker said i'd burned 500-600 calories in an hour. great workout! if i can do it, anyone can do it!"
5-star,1,just had a great class with tom. brought my teenagers and they also had a great time. everyone was really friendly and helpful getting two new riders situated. also appreciated being able to borrow shoes for the girls-thanks!
5-star,1,"a friend of mine brought me here for my first real spin/cycling class. i was very inexperienced and had no idea what i was doing. not only was the instructor so helpful in the thursday 5:30 pm class, but super motivating. she kept encouraging the class and i felt like i got a great workout. also, all of the riders were helpful and nice as well. no one looked at me like i was dumb for not knowing what i was doing, an experience i have run into as a first timer at other fitness classes. i attended a second class with my friend, a 5:30 am class on wednesday morning, and despite being tired that class was awesome also. the instructor actually came up and introduced herself to me after the class was over and told me i was doing great. everyone is super encouraging and i will for sure be back, they were awesome and deserve kudos for it!!"
1-star,0,"the class was fine, nothing special, standard spin class without fancy add-one . i appreciated that it was dark so i only concentrated on the riding. i may have gone back but the woman at the reception desk was unbelievably rude. she insulted me more than once and was mad when i didn't want to buy a $80 package instead of the $5 first ride. i don't care if there is a great deal, if i don't like the class i will not return. too bad they never had the chance thanks to the woman who obviously thought i was below her."
4-star,1,"i needed some fitness and 360spin fit the bill. i'm a beginner/novice and was made to feel at home. the class was the perfect challenge for any experience level. this was the first time i've ever used "" clip in"" bike shoes, it was easy after the receptionist explained it to me. i've been back for a second class and it was even more fun. spin cycling to great music with cool instructors in total darkness is awesome."
4-star,1,"this place is pretty cool. i have never done a spin class before and recently came here at a friend's suggestion. we all met up and signed the required paperwork, paid the fee and had a little time to stretch before the session got started. it was definitely different but also fun. very challenging, especially for a newbie but the instructor was good and it was a dark ride so i did not feel as awkward being new. every so often black lights turn on as the instructor amps the class up which is a fun touch. the music is pretty decent as well. i definitely got a workout in that is for sure. the only thing i wasn't as much of a fan of was the fact that you have to clip in to the bikes. they have shoes there for you to wear which is fine, but i am not used to riding and being clipped in was a little weird while trying to figure out what was going on in the class. outside of that, i had a great time. i would come back more often but it is not really close to my house. more than likely i will come back here and there to see where i measure up on the fitness scale as far as cycling. if you like spin classes this is a cool variation to try out."
5-star,1,"i decided to take the plunge and finally try a spinning class. glad that it was here, a perfect environment to feel like a newbie. (the spin studio is dark, really dark. arrive with plenty of time to find a bike and to adjust it for your frame & body.) i was greeted at 8:45am by the instructor and spinning phenom, samantha. she played great music and inspired everyone to push harder.she would turn up the music occasionally when the black light was on, it became also trance or rave- like. after visiting a few more spin classes at the village on camelback, i learned that studio 360 is a stand-up studio (they rarely sit down when riding.) after more spin practice, i will return and see if i can ride standing up the whole time. sorry that i missed out on the yoga studio 360, that segment of the business ended a few months ago."
5-star,1,"this studio was awesome. this was the first time i've ever ridden in the dark. cycling doesn't seem intense, but it is! the music was really good and i had a lot of fun. the only thing i like better at corebalance was that you can wear your own tennis shoes and don't need to pay for special shoes."
5-star,1,"ok, full disclosure, this was my first ""spin"" class. i'm usually seen on a road bike, and in daylight. the class amazing, the music perfect, attitude great and the work out..fantastic! i will be going back. it was a little difficult to get the 'moves' down that are particular to this studio, but i was told everyone goes through it. simply put, it was the most fun i've had doing a workout. =) good job!"
5-star,1,"i stumbled across this class by accident. i had done spinning at home in the uk and had tried an la fitness class here in phoenix which was ... ok. i came to studio 360 and couldn't believe i didn't collapse in a crumpled heap on the floor. somehow i kept going to the end of the class. it was hard. i was completely addicted. i have since been going for probably about 6 months. in that time my father in the uk has been diagnosed with a terminal brain tumor and i really can be honest in saying that going to this class 2/3 times a week is the only time when i have 60 minute periods in which i don't feel like i'm crippled with fear and dread about what is happening at home. oh, and i've dropped 2 dress sizes. it would probably be more, but i really like wine (i'm european. we drink. too much.) so what my boyfriend affectionately refers to as my ""wine pouch"" reamins. but i have abs underneath. most importantly - for 60 minutes of the day i feel like a champion. thank you studio 360."
5-star,1,"i've been to both yoga and spin classes at this studio and really each of them. i'll break them down... yoga: i have been to almost every yoga studio and town and 360 is definitely one of my favorites. it has a great, open vibe to it and the teachers are fantastic. i've been to 4 or 5 different instructors and they are all really good (lonnie and ana are my favorite). i get a good workout - and feel totally energized after. i started going to 360 a few months ago and my yoga was very beginner and i was pretty rusty. but i felt totally comfortable in every class going at my own pace. they've got a lot of different types of classes and a pretty decent schedule. try them out! spin: the spin classes were a little overwhelming for me at first. they ride drop saddle (meaning you are standing the whole time) - so that was hard for me to get used to. but, after i went to a few classes i got the hang of it and was able to get an amazing workout. definitely makes you sweat! finding a teacher who plays good music is key because it makes the class fly by (cinnaree and laura are awesome). i ended up buying my own spin shoes, but they have ones you can borrow at first which i thought was nice. plus, both types of classes are really reasonably priced compared to other local studios - not easy to find."
5-star,1,"i am taking my 3rd class tonight and i love it! when the hour long spin class is done you will wonder how it went by so fast. the music is loud and the lights are off or dimmed most of the time which for me really takes your mind off the cardio and the burn and keeps you motivated. -come early (15 minutes) -bring water -bring a small towel -don't have shoes? you can borrow! -prepare for an amazing workout and a lot of fun! if you haven't done spinning before don't worry, i did my first class with at beginner and she was fine. just make sure you tell the front desk person that you are new and they will take great care of you!"
4-star,1,"love spinning here! it's always a hard workout and i've only been to the beginner classes - can't imagine what the advanced ones are like. the mon and wed evening teachers are great and play fun music. after a crazy day at work, this is the perfect outlet and a great way to clear your mind. the only other spin class i've done were at la fitness - these are 100x better. it's intense, you never sit down, black lights and fun music and everyone is super nice and helpful. i've been coming here for more than a year and would recommend it to anyone!"
5-star,1,"i stumbled on this studio through living social and i'm so glad i did. it's a small studio with only one room but it's really the perfect size for me. although i typically look to yoga for the mental practice as much as the physical, this is more physical than i realized i could do. the classes in the a.m. have the same poses and flows daily but it does not make it easier. it increases my heart rate and has me pouring in sweat and sore the next day but it's not too much that it should scare off any other newbies like myself. i'm absolutely addicted and really dig the instructors. i will say i liked the studio the first week i went prior to the new decorating. although the mural in the studio is lovely it just had a very modern and clean feeling before. i also liked it without the curtains. either way, it makes zero difference, the classes are great!"
4-star,1,"i went to studio 360 for the second time last week and ironically enough, the instructor had read my yelp review and remembered that i liked it hotter. this was a different instructor than the first one i had (sorry can't remember eithers names), but she was so nice and accomodating. she suggested i move to the far right side of room, where there was a space heater set up so i got the extra heat. burned up a great sweat and was super happy :) i really appreciated the fact that studio took my comments to heart. this instructor was also slightly more fast paced, which i enjoyed."
1-star,0,"why don't they list descriptions of their yoga classes online? why, when i inquired was i not provided with one? just so i am clear: a description of yoga classes included not only the times and days of each class...not just the name of the instructor...the type of yoga and whether it is a beginner, moderate or advanced class is pretty standard. also, the living social or groupon link to the site brings you to a random website that isn't their official one. scary."
5-star,1,"this place is amazing!! best hour workout i've ever experienced and i've tried everything!! great teachers and people, awesome energy and just a lot of fun! i am so hooked!! i dont see how anyone can say a bad thing about this place, except for that they simply can't handle a true, intense workout."
3-star,0,"if i could separate the yoga studio 360 and the spinning 360, here is how my rating would look: yoga 360: four stars - i am brand new at yoga, but i've always wanted to try it for the workout and to strengthen my weak neck and back. i've been every tuesday for the past three weeks and it's been amazing every time. dana is great and she really helped me my first day to get my bearings. literally yesterday i convinced myself to get a membership to this club because of their yoga... until i went to today's spin class spinning 360: 1 star - on their website, it makes new riders feel very welcome. again, i am brand new to spinning. they suggested to come early, get set up with free shoes and they'll ""introduce you"" to the bike. so today i got there 15 minutes early and was excited when i saw 10-15 people milling around, chatting and laughing like a group of friends. unfortunately the girl behind the counter did not acknowledge my existence for literally 10 minutes. it was becoming comically frustrating. by the time she got me signed in and a pair of shoes the class had started. trying to clip into a bike when you've never done it before with all of the lights out and music thumping is impossible... so i walked out. it was embarassing and a waste of time. i'm sure this isn't how it is always, but unfortunately my month ends soon, so i / they won't have a second chance. i'll finish out my month of yoga classes next week and instead of signing up for another month... i'll find a different studio."
5-star,1,wow!!! i just took a spinning class from ty and it was great! i had a knee replacement 10 years ago and have not been able to run since. i have done other cardio workouts but nothing compared to running. this class gave me that 'runner's high' i so enjoy. ty is a sweetheart and very motivating. she uses a terrific mix of music too.
5-star,1,this is more than just a spin class. this is a mind altering experience that combines incredible music with exercise in the dark. it is more than exercise and more like therapy.
5-star,1,"i love studio 360!! it is an arcadia institution. if you live in arcadia and you have not been here...that's fine because i don't want you taking my bike, but you really are missing out! if you like working out in a group without feeling like everyone is staring at you this is perfect because it's dark (with the exception of the occasional black light). spinning at 360 is group exercise but like yoga it is individual with a sense of group support. it is drop saddle style, so you stand the entire class, which i actually find easier than the alternative. it's good for people who enjoy dance as well, it is very rhythmic. best work out i have ever had, but you don't have to be a work out freak to enjoy 360. the instructors are great. if you are new to it i suggest tues night with denise. always show up at least 15 minutes early to get a spot and learn how to ride. their motto is ""to see the light you have to ride like hell in the dark"" :) enjoy!"
1-star,0,this place might well be cited for disturbing the peace. on week-end mornings one can often hear the throbbing bass beat inside of other nearby businesses and even out in the parking lot. the ambience reminds me of a low-rider with one of those souped-up stereos that you can feel coming down the road long before you can hear it. seems like i've been front and center at punk rock shows that had less prominent bass lines than this place has on sunday mornings.
5-star,1,spinning. hardcore. that about sums it up. give it a try if you want a workout that will totally kick your ass and leave you crying.
5-star,1,"mike alexander at summerlin athletics delivers a great product. crossfit, metabolic classes, etc. that help you reach your fitness goals. personal training that pushes me to work harder than i'd ever manage on my own. if being fit matters to you, you should try summerlin athletics!"
5-star,1,"summerlin crossfit is my home away from home. the instructors are knowledgeable and the community is one of the best. weather you've been doing crossfit for 5 years or 5 min, you'll be comfortable here!"
5-star,1,"my husband and i started going to summerlin crossfit about 5 years ago. mike the owner is very knowledgeable on creating personalized workouts for your fitness level, as a personal trainer as well as crossfit coach! the box is very clean and the equipment is up to date. also, it is very reasonably priced."
5-star,1,"i tried several gyms in the summerlin/las vegas area, and summerlin crossfit was by far the best for me. the coaches are all extremely knowledgeable, and always helping teach and correct technique. classes are just the right size (enough people to keep you motivated, but not so many that it's crowded and the coaches can't keep an eye on everyone). the other participants are very friendly and great company during a workout. i always enjoy my time there. there's a good mix of beginners and experienced athletes. mike (the owner) knows everyone, and he is always looking for ways to make the gym better, by adding new types of classes or getting new equipment. i'm hooked, and look forward to going to the gym every chance i get."
5-star,1,"as a consultant, i'm traveling a lot for my job and i visited 20 different crossfit nationally and internationally in the last 4 years. this one in summerlin is different for the following reasons: - the coaches are always paying attention to you and correct you if you need to. i need a lot of it as i'm not the best synchronized athlete - the classes are rarely packed, and you know all the family' members - the box is super clean which is not the case for most of them, to be honest. no smell, no dust. this is the best crossfit place i've visited so far."
5-star,1,"i've been working out in different gyms my whole life and there is nothing better than training at summerlin crossfit. the coaches, the facility and the members make it a great experience for newbies or people who have been in the gym their whole lives. i've been a member for about 3 years and i never plan on leaving here unless i were to move out of state. it's motivating, challenging and fun! thanks for all your help scf!"
5-star,1,"i've been cross fitting for many years and in different states/cities... this box is just amazing for all the reasons. there is not one coach here that doesn't know what they're doing! each one is unique in what they bring to the table, but they're all very skilled, positive and motivating. as for the schedule- best i've ever seen! even has sunday times! that never happens! the people that we workout with are all shapes and sizes, no egos, and everyone is very encouraging. please do yourself a favor and check this place out, you will be welcomed!"
5-star,1,"i have thought i would be into crossfit, but thanks to this gym i'm hooked! chris is extremely professional and welcoming. he us so helpful and really takes his time to make sure his athletes and new members are accomodated. mike very well versed in his coaching, techniques and strength building which has got me going on the weekends. the people: amazing. but you should come try it out and see for yourself! you'll find me here at the 7pm- i love this place that much."
5-star,1,"awesome place with awesome people running it! chris is a very professional and sincere trainer who will work with you to perfect your form before moving on to more advanced work outs. he is patient and kind, motivating you to do the move correctly so that your body does not get injured while working out. i highly recommend this gym!"
5-star,1,i'm visiting this box from out of the area. i felt very welcome from the moment i walked in. the owner chris was very helpful and nice. i definitely recommend and will be going back when i'm in the area.
5-star,1,"if you are looking for a friendly, clean and fun place, this is it! i looked at all the xfit places in town and asked so many friends what they recommend. and i decided to do my own and settled on this place. i am so happy i did! they will cater to what you can handle. and sometimes what you can handle is more than you think! they push you but not by screaming at you or working you till you throw up. instead they use friendly words of encouragement. the owner, chris, is ridiculously nice! i highly recommend this place! come join me! see you there!"
5-star,1,"i have never been a workout person. i've always hated sweating and regular gyms are always so boring and do absolutely nothing to boost my motivation. i snagged a groupon for summerlin crossfit last year, thinking that it's cheap & if i might as well give it a try... and have been completely hooked ever since! everyone here is so nice and it didn't even bother me that i was last for every wod. everyone cheers you on after they're done - ""almost there, keep it up!"" and the hi-fives afterward help keep you motivated & push you forward. i've always felt pretty socially awkward but everyone here really does treat you like family from the beginning and it's so amazing! the wods will leave you unbelievably sore afterward but keep going back... the only way to get past the soreness is to do it again! completing them makes me feel so powerful and seeing the difference from week to week in my body is definitely a huge encouragement. the results are truly amazing - i didn't drop weight because i gained muscle but i went down two dress sizes in 4 months! this is truly the best gym i've ever been to and i would (and have!) recommend it to anyone who is looking to start out or those just looking for a new box - you don't be disappointed."
5-star,1,"i had been thinking about crossfit for a while, obsessively reading yelp reviews and trying to figure out who i was going to give my $150 for an intro course when a groupon for summerlin crossfit appeared. everyone in the gym is extremely welcoming. the coaches knew my name right away and i am never silently waiting for class to start - someone says hi always. i thought i was in ok shape until my first class. we reviewed movements, practiced form, got feedback, and tried a mini wod. one round into it i thought i was going to vomit. i knew crossfit was about being hardcore and pushing yourself, so i was a little worried that the coaches would try to tell me to keep going. no worries though! they were super nice, could see that i was ill, and talked to me about breathing. i didn't even finish my first wod, but they told me to come back, so i did. i finished my intro courses and bought a monthly membership (they discount for teachers!) i love the crossfit classes and am very excited that they've added a yoga class to the calendar."
5-star,1,came here for the trx classes and was very pleased! great gym and good people! highly recommended if you're looking for a great trx place.
5-star,1,"i am a triathlete that has a hard time fitting in a full weight lifting schedule. i've starting doing crossfit just over a month ago to help me develop more functional strength throughout my upper body, core and legs. this was definitely a plus to my training. working at summerlin crossfit is awesome. chris and mike are so supportive and provide a great atmosphere that is challenging, but not threatening. they work with everyone to guide improvement, friendly competition and most importantly camaraderie among all participants. if you are thinking of crossfit, you are doing yourself wrong if you don't check out this gym. you won't be disappointed."
5-star,1,"i had been an avid crossfitter for about a year and a half when i moved to las vegas in october of 2012. one of my first priorities was to find a new crossfit box i could call home. i researched and visited a couple of gyms before coming into summerlin crossfit and was disappointed by the other places. the staff is amazing here and welcomed me with open arms! they gave me great deals to start off and i am totally hooked now! this is not just a gym to work out in, it is a motivating environment where everyone soon becomes family. chris and mike are very knowledgable and can help anyone achieve their fitness goals. i have found my new crossfit home at summerlin crossfit and i am here to stay. i would recommend this gym to anyone that wants a challenge, wants to meet their fitness goals, and wants to make some great friends along the way : )"
5-star,1,"with so many crossfit gyms in las vegas it is often hard to choose one to work out at--but i believe summerlin crossfit is truly the best in town! my husband & i joined summerlin crossfit in october (2012) and couldn't be happier! chris & mike are extremely knowledgable trainers and push us to our fullest extent during workouts. they will scale the wod for each member depending on his/her fitness level, injuries, etc. the camaraderie with chris, mike, and the fellow crossfitters is amazing. everyone is there to motivate & help one another. i truly look forward to going every day to work out and hang out with everyone who i now consider my ""crossfit family."" since starting crossfit, my running times have greatly improved. as an avid runner for the past 10+ years, this has been amazing. i am also feeling so much stronger than i was with my previous non-crossfit workout regimen. besides giving us butt-kicking wods each day, chris & mike are extremely knoweldegable in mobility & flexibility. they make sure to lead us through extensive warm-up exercises and stretches prior to every workout. i love summerlin crossfit and my ""crossfit family!!"" :)"
5-star,1,"since i began going to summerlin crossfit three months ago, i have not went to another gym. while i primarily attend crossfit, the great part about this place is that in addition to crossfit, it has trx classes, spin classes, personal training and even barre. i have done all of the above except for barre. chris and mike are both incredible coaches and they take individual time to assist you -- whether it be in reaching a particular goal, working on a particular exercise or focusing on a sore spot or stiff muscle. in addition, they make workouts fun. there is a real sense of community here. if you have never done crossfit, what are you waiting for? but be careful, it is addictive. not only is it good for the body, but it is good for the spirit as well."
5-star,1,absolutely amazing place! i had to make a yelp account just so i could review them and give them the credit they deserve. the staff is incredibly friendly and always willing to give you any extra help you might need on any of the moves. this was my first time starting crossfit so i was really unsure about whether i would like it or not. but after coming here i tell everyone i know that if they're thinking about starting then they need to come here.
5-star,1,this place is great ! i am new to crossfit and was very nervous to start . the coaches are very patient and great and explaining and helping you understand the moves. they make sure that you don't hurt yourself. you will get a great workout and a lot of encouragement to push yourself. it's a lot of work but i always look forward to going back !
5-star,1,"after look in another places we chose stay in syndicate and let me tell you that was our best decision, the classes are amazing ! coaches are awesome, all the staff and people here are pretty nice ! don't look in any other place! my boyfriend and i love this place !! come and try! you won't regret it :)"
1-star,0,"my wife went to this gym with our 3 and 4 year old boys to look into some after school programs. we were very reluctant to place our children in the program because we thought they were too young, but the sale person at the register assured us they would give us a chance to try it out and if it did not work out, they would issue a refund to us. i came in with my wife to discuss this with them and this is what we both were promised. unfortunately, our children did not enjoy the class, they were distracted and it did not work out. it was obvious that they were too young and not ready so we pulled them out and informed the donny (the guy who signed us up) that we would not continue the class and we did want the refund. he assured us that we would get a refund. after not receiving a refund, we get this response: "" i apologize for the delay in response- i wanted to make sure i went over the case thoroughly. i also apologize that someone at the desk said that you would receive a refund;it is not our policy to issue refunds in cases like yours. nevertheless we would like to offer to meet you half way and refund you half of your initial payment."" we do not want half of our money back. our kids showed up for less than 1 full session and we pulled them out as we had discussed with donny. it is upsetting when you visit a business and they lie to you. it is also upsetting when the business does not stand behind their employees promises, even if they don't agree with them. i would be careful when doing business with syndicate mma and make sure you don't get promises they won't deliver."
5-star,1,"the best of the best are created at this gym. everyone here trains hard and encourages you to do the same. the staff is really nice and will make you feel very comfortable. they provide a variety of different equipment and classes ranging from brazilian ju jitsu, muay thai, kids programs and strength/conditioning classes. the coaches are great and the atmosphere is nice too. if you are looking for somewhere you can actually for us and work out. this is the place to come.."
5-star,1,"so its my first night at syndicate ever, i've just finished a boxing class with jason (it was awesome) and i'm sitting on the bleachers pretty convinced i'm going to join this gym. and then... gsp walks in the door to train for the jonny hendricks fight. yes, thats right, gsp. any doubt about joining instantly went out the window, and the fan boy in me muttered a meek ""hey gsp"" when he walked past. lol. syndicate is a about as good as it gets in terms of an mma gym. i've been to more than a few gyms, and often they are uninviting, click-ish, and full of ""tough guys"". syndicate is nothing like this. the minute you walk in both nate and casey are extremely friendly, do not pressure you to buy anything, and are more than willing to show you around and even let you try a few classes to see if this is a fit for you. you can see from the first day that although some students truly desire to be fighters, others are training for general fitness or overall knowledge. either way, you'll fit right in. if your thinking about joining a gym of any sort, come here and give it a try. you won't be disappointed!"
1-star,0,"we took are son here. they told the cut off age was 5 years. my son went there enjoy, his time an then. not even the owner dosnt come out an tell us anything. only one of here employees came up to us an example. we make expsions, for 5 years olds. if they can, get through the class, an they don't slow down the other student he is included in the class. if she told my wife that the children start at 6 years of age. we would not have wasted are time today. the owner of the company or neither a trainer came up to us an said. how are son do, or, if he did good or bad. as the owner of this company see should came up to us an gave us some insights. or answers. i would be spectacle of this place . they just want your money. they don't offer any information or insight or even any instructions on your child. an then they misinform you on there age, just to get you inside the door. this owner is very unprofessional an should not be running, this business or any other business. very poor business practice."
5-star,1,"the instructors are awesome. they have lots of energy and they provide great instructions on how to box properly. the gym is very clean and the people who go there are very nice. it feels like a big family. also, the owner, blakey, is simply an awesome person!"
5-star,1,"i needed a gym while i was out in las vegas for a week and decided to check out title boxing club. this is definitely a gym you want to go to and check out if you're looking for that high energy in a workout!!! the staff is very welcoming, with a no pressure feel. you definitely get that family vibe and comradery from the staff and all the members make you feel welcome and at home. i took a boxing class with coach tyler and he kept everyone's heart rate pumping and cooled things down at the right times. i will definitely come by next time i'm in las vegas for a few days to get my workout on!!!!"
5-star,1,i recently joined & i love this gym! i feel comfortable there and all the instructors are super nice. best place i have boxed at yet. the workouts are fun & challenging! i highly recommend going and trying a class.
5-star,1,"the staff and the club overall are wonderful. i think what does it for me is how friendly and fun they make this place. i first heard about a boxing and brunch event from facebook. i found the place to be very spacious and inviting! blakele, tyler and ronnie are super nice and welcoming. i've been to two of their boxing and brunch events. they also host a glow event where they hire a dj, turn down the lights and give you how in the dark bracelets. if it wasn't so far for me, i would probably have a membership. the workouts kick my butt every time and i can't wait to go back for some more!"
5-star,1,"this is the gym where everyone is treated like family. every staff member is friendly and always greet you with a happy face. each workout is as intense as you want it to be and i have to admit i have an addiction to the best hour of my day, everyday. you don't have to worry about the people around you during the workout because each workout it's just between you and the bag."
5-star,1,"it's a great work out! it's fun, stress relieving, and you burn a lot of calories! it's amazing the change i've seen in some of the members! the music is always pumping, i love it! i have to mention that blakele classes are tough, which is why i love them! individual technique classes are available too, all the trainers are awesome and very friendly."
5-star,1,"what a great workout! josh usually kicks our butts at 6am, the breakfast club, but today the owner, blakele, did the honors! i literally had to give myself a pep talk to get out of my car and walk into work, between the warm up, 8 rounds and the core work out! i will be back again tomorrow to spend that first hour of the day working on me! thanks to all the great trainers and great facility at title henderson!"
5-star,1,"just became a member at title boxing and i'm so impressed with this gym. it's clean, classes are intense and coaches are outstanding. special shoutout to josh and blakely for kicking my butt daily at 6am. truly appreciate you and the gym."
5-star,1,"my friends invited me to try this spot out. i said, ""why not?"" turns out it was a super cool experience. as soon as i walked into the facility, every single staff member working went out of their way to come over and introduce themself to me and say hello. i met blakele, ria, vanessa and ronnie. and their friendliness was not just for me, i noticed they greeted all their regulars in the same manner. i love seeing that as you don't see much of this at many places. i can tell they treat everyone like family here. it was a breath of fresh air. ronnie was our boxing instructor for the day. he'a just awesome. very helpful in prepping me for what to expect in the class. once class started, it was intense. but a good intense. the boxing workout is no joke. it works every part of your body!!! everything!!! and to be honest, i had fun and i felt like a total badass. i enjoyed this class. i can also see how going to regular classes would get anyone in shape. i'm bringing the husband next time. totally a cool experience. i'm telling everyone about this place!!!"
5-star,1,"i have been a member of ufc for 8 years, and was invited for a workout today at title boxing. i was totally in awe of what an incredible workout we had. its like going from high school football, to playing in the super bowl. the owner is great, as was the trainer, josh. i highly recommend you give it a try. its only a mile from the ufc on eastern, but light years ahead on service, workout, and intensity"
5-star,1,"seriously one of the most comfortable, clean, and technically sound boxing gyms i have been to, and i have only taken their free class. i have been training on and off since 2006 and been to gyms from california to vegas in its mma heyday. just give it a go, you won't regret it."
5-star,1,i've been coming here for a little over a month now and i'm in as good as shape now as i was when i was running high school track. it's the best workout in town! not to mention how exhilarating it is landing stronger and stronger punches week after week. i would recommend this place to anyone regardless of gender or age. you get out of it what you want to put in!!! oh and every single trainer seriously rocks
5-star,1,"i love title! we have been coming here since they opened and what a transformation! i say we since my whole family of 4 comes with me. the workouts are good for my 12 and 16year old as well. the staff is very friendly and knowledgeable about adjustments needed for all the workouts. we do boxing/kickboxing classes, we personal train there and participate in the boot camp classes when they have them. it's a great workout guaranteed to burn 500-1000 calories. i would rather spend an hour here burning calories than at the gym on a treadmill any day! if you haven't tried it...you should! it's fun! the hour flies by!"
5-star,1,"a great boxing and fitness club. this isn't a gym and you really do feel like part of a family. dubbed the ""friendliest club in town"", you have to come in and meet the members and staff to find out why. ownership is top notch and truly cares about the members needs. this club is run with a high amount of integrity and is a great environment to meet your fitness goals."
5-star,1,"i love coming here. the trainers are awesome and really friendly. it's a high energy, family-like environment that makes working out fun. i used to weight lift and do cardio at a regular gym, but this workout is better than any weight lifting mixed with cardio i've ever done. if you don't like to workout or you're looking to switch up your current workout, go to title. i guarantee you'll absolutely love it."
5-star,1,"this is the most amazing gym! i've always been and runner and never even considered boxing as something i'd like to do bc i don't care for gyms. one of my friends convinced me to go bc i need to build my upper body strength for a race, and i fell in love! everyone is super friendly, the trainers are fun and make the classes exciting, and people of all ages and skill levels participate...which makes it a blast! highly recommend this gym!!"
5-star,1,"just started two weeks ago. very clean and well-organized facility. the staff members are very friendly and helpful. all levels can work out, and the trainers work well with all levels. i especially like getting a great workout in, while relieving stress and frustrations. it is definitely worth the free class they give to give it a try."
5-star,1,"if you are looking to amp up your workout or just starting your fitness journey this is the gym to be at! it's great for all fitness levels. all the instructors are full of knowledge, skills, and passion. the classes will pump you up so much that even tho you are sweating your butt off the hour goes by fast. i highly recommend title boxing for your next workout !"
5-star,1,"love this place! all of the trainers are wonderful. very high energy and they really do create a family-like atmosphere. no matter how tired i am after work, i still always want to go to title for a session because i feel so great afterwards. boxing works muscles i didn't even know i had! it's also the best stress reliever. if you're looking for a new way to get in shape that doesn't involve running (i am not the running type), this is perfect. feel excellent, make new friends, and gain new skills. worth every penny. the warm ups are very intense, but the trainers always remind us to pace ourselves and provide modifications for each move. the eight rounds of boxing/kickboxing fly by, then core. the core workout is pretty rough also, but this is where i definitely notice improvement in my strength and abilities to perform exercises i could not in the past. come join our title family!"
5-star,1,great place to burn 1000 plus calories per session. the facility is first class with high energy trainers that know how to motivate!!! i love this place
5-star,1,great place! totally impressed n i'll let the pics speak. everyone is nice n felt like family with history. the class cousins son took was awesome n he enjoyed it!
5-star,1,this is my favorite place to tan. i've also used the red light therapy stand up bed here and i liked it more than the lay down rlt bed at the last salon i was going to. friendly staff and reasonable prices and weekend tanning specials compared to other tanning salons. love that they're open late too!
5-star,1,"love this place! have gone there for 4 spray tans in the versa spray machine they have on level 2. such a natural looking tan and not orange at all. they also have great prices. the workers are always welcoming and friendly. if you're looking for a great natural-looking spray tan, go here"
5-star,1,"their beds are hot and put on an awesome base in just one session, however i have olive skin and tan fairly easily. had everything i need right there! service is excellent too! i look forward to going back!"
5-star,1,helpful and friendly customer service (i'm not sure of his name) and i got great color from the level three bed right before a trip.
5-star,1,i usually go to a different tanning company but this place was the only place open after i got off work (there hours are amazing) so i figured why not try it out. wow it was amazing! not only was the staff very welcoming but the facility is super clean and the versa booth was so much faster than at the place i usually go to! i will be back!!!!
5-star,1,"this review is about my first, ever ""spray tan."" i elected to have this done as i had just had a cancerous mole removed from my lower cheek. i figured this is a ""safer"" way to get a tan than spending more time out in the sun plus i was headed to california to visit family. i went in on tuesday to take advantage of the half off spray tan pricing offered. the male receptionist (didn't get his name) explained that there are ""three levels"" of spray tan that can be purchased. the higher the number, the darker the spray tan. i decided on a level two spray tan with skin conditioning spray which is supposed to make your tan last longer than four-five days. i was taken into the room which had a versa spray tan machine( see video- https://youtu.be/xixgz2ehmjm ). they explained how to operate the machine and demonstrated each of the four body positions i would assume in order to maximize my spray tan. i was also shown how to prep your hands finger nails and toes with lotion to keep the spray tan from coloring these parts of your body. since it was a private room, i was advised to strip off all my clothing (after he left), and lock the door. i followed the instructions as given and came out of the machine with a great ""tan!"" as a side note, i drove 25 miles to tangible tanning, and it was definitely worth it ! not only will i go back, i will bring my wife also; probably, next week.."
5-star,1,"i had the best experience in spray tanning ever....jake was beyond friendly and helpful. i purchased the groupon and from prior experiences with other companies, my expectations were pretty low but i was blown away. the space is welcoming and smelled great and i felt completely at ease. the drive is a little far for me but after my first impression i would much rather drive an extra few minutes to get the amazing service. not to mention the spray looks fantastic- not orangey and no streaking. way to go tangible tanning :)"
5-star,1,this place is amazing! i go on tuesdays during their spray tan special. jake at the front desk provides exceptional customer service. he is very knowledgeable about their products and services and he always has a super positive attitude. highly recommend!
5-star,1,"wow i know i just stumbled upon the coolest place called tangible tanning .i received the best massage ever by jason.he was very professional,attentative to my concerns and the room and music made me feel like i was floating in bali waters .the entire place is a must see and i definetley will be back . the no pressure thing has got to make this place ... the place to be in 2017!"
5-star,1,"i am new to the area and by good fortune ran across a groupon for this great spot! had my first tanning session today and let me just say this i've been to many tanning salons throughout the valley and tangible tanning has really impressed me! they are knowledgeable, friendly and very helpful, i'm already looking forward to my next session!"
5-star,1,"this place is awesome! it's really cute and clean, a very comfortable atmosphere. there are other closer tanning salons to my apartment, but i prefer to drive the extra couple miles for the excellent service and quality of tanning beds/spray tan. it must be said that jake is wildly fabulous and incredibly knowledgeable on all things tanning! he's a diamond in the rough, truly one hell of a guy. i'm hooked."
5-star,1,"full disclosure: i'm a tanning snob. i've been going for years and i have extremely high standards for cleanliness, customer service, cost and bed quality. that being said, i've been a member here for almost a year and i'm not going anywhere! except maybe their new gym/salon when it opens. the cost is comparable to most of the salons in the valley, but tangible is the only one that seems worth the money. the beds are immaculately clean every time and they've got a wide variety to choose from. the staff is friendly and they've got a great selection of products to choose from. did i mention they're open long hours so you can go (almost) whenever? now onto the gym; i have a membership to it but embarrassingly have yet to use it. the gym seems well stocked, clean, and not too busy at any time of the day. i'll update this review if i ever make it over there lol."
5-star,1,"these guys are great! i burn very easily and need to get a tan before jamaica! they explained the differences between the beds, and helped me figure out a max time to be in a bed without burning!! they're always friendly and helpful, and always have a smile for you when you walk through the door! the beds and rooms are always clean, i am quite satisfied with tangible tanning!"
5-star,1,very sweet and welcoming staff! they have nice products for tanning as well as nutritional items. very clean and professional! i will be back
5-star,1,"only the greatest gym in the world. this is where i can work out, tan, get my hair done, buy my supplements at rock bottom prices, attend a yoga class, drop off my dry cleaning, buy top of the line scented candles, make a christmas charity donation, get a massage and my eyebrows waxed now. allllll with the friendliest, most helpful and tolerant staff i've ever seen anywhere. what the hell else could you possibly ask for? very reasonable membership prices without any contract drama? great hours? spotlessly clean environment? plenty of equipment that's not constantly taken over by excess members? the great feeling that comes from knowing you're supporting a local business run by amazing people who deserve and appreciate your business? check, check, check, check and check! i made the mistake of joining gold's gym and 24 hr fitness. i learned my lesson. i started coming here just to tan a few years back and they've now won over my whole family forever. what we need is a group package! there are tons of trainers around which i personally want nothing to do with, but they're all nice and don't bother us in any way. there's never any pressure of sales or nickle and diming. it feels like we know everyone there and they know us right back. i know the place is moving soon and we just pray they stay close, because we would be traumatized to have to go elsewhere. we love you guys!"
5-star,1,very helpful and friendly staff. went in for a massage and now on the massage plan :) if you need a massage tanner can work on you and make you feeling better!
5-star,1,"i love this salon! i went in there today, they were so nice and clean! cleanliness is such a big thing for me because i have tanned at most the tanning salon in the valley it hard to find a good one. they were amazing and i can't wait to come back. they also have versa spa spray tan! i love that!"
5-star,1,went there for indoor tanning and what quite impressed with how polite the two gentlemen that helped me were. overall a great experience.
5-star,1,chris was really helpful and took the time to explain the process to me for the spray tanning booth. i look forward to returning!
5-star,1,"one happy elite yelper here. i am a newer member to this facility. my trainer introduced me to tangibles july of this year. i am quite impressed with the quality of making you feel at home service.i have always been a member of larger gym facilities which did not offer that personal touch. a tangible's every customer is immediately greeted by first name with a smile no matter what time of day it is. the location is ""very"" clean with fresh towel service for members. it is a smaller gym with plenty of the latest machines. no waiting to use your favorite fitness workout machine. plenty of room with a variety of machine options. the gym offers a variety of services from classes, trainers, tanning, salon services and much more. be sure to review the website for daily specials. highlights: tangibles is services and memberships are affordable. clean restroom facilities. staff very welcoming early and later hours 7 days a week. top certified trainers salon services to include cellulite reduction, massages, and much much more."
5-star,1,"upon first moving here 2 years ago, i had the worse experience attempting to get an airbrush spray tan at this salon. they had only 2 people at specific times that could spray you custom. no problem showed up and the tech could not figure out how to use the gun. so awkward enough him being a male and standing there naked, i oopted to get my money back after waiting 20 min. well a couple months back they ran a deal for versa, which is a booth spray tan. i love this booth..it is like airbrushing but private, and this spray tan absolutely does not smell or stain your sheets! i found this upon leaving denver, co. and just fogot until i saw it online oneday on living deals for amazon.:) one down two to go..all for $29 :) love! as far as the gym goes, never used it!"
2-star,0,"what happened here???? i go away for a bit and come back and the place turns to clownville? tangible,i've got to say i'm disappointed. the prices have gone up and the customer service has gone to shit. it's gotten overrun with gymbunnies/rats who meander near the equipment doing not much more than staring at themselves flex. then there's the proliferation of independant personal trainers. there's no one on staff that can tell you how to use the machines if you're new,and if you can't afford or want to use an independant trainer,you're left to flounder and feel foolish. to the faux jillian trainer,could you stop yelling at your clients from across the damn gym?this is not your reality show,you sound like an ass.i don't go to the gym to be subjected to your showboating and frankly,you're obnoxious. unfortunatley,this is the only game in town for me at the moment. i only hope as the holidays near,the place will empty out somewhat. i used to love this gym,now i simply tolerate it."
5-star,1,"love, love.....love this place, super cool people work out there, you walk in and spend a few minutes waving and acknowledging people. the equipment is great, it is never so packed you stand around wondering what machine you can get in on. the trainers there are great....so worthwhile to invest in a little kick start. it is not oriented just towards ""muscle""....it seems the trainers incorporate fitness, cardio, core in their programs and you can see all kinds of ages and diversities there. did i mention that i love it??? they have now opened up for 24hrs during the week and the monthly fees are mindblowingly reasonable!! i must say it is super close to my house, but if i didn't love it sooooo much i still wouldn't go.staff are uber friendly too."
5-star,1,"everything you need to meet your fitness goals- weight, supplements, educated trainers. small, but doesn't get busy-especially now with the open area. inexpensive- no contract, sign-up, or cancellation fee's amenities- complimentary lockers and towels not the stuffiness of an""la fitness- style"" gym"
5-star,1,super clean! friendly staff who are always working not just sitting behind a counter. owner is a great guy and the membership price cant be beat. i switched to here from another downtown gym and couldnt be happier.
4-star,1,"i've been going to this gym for awhile now, and even though it's gone under many management changes, it's still a good gym. membership is $20/month charged via eft. no initiation or cancellation fees. i've never had to cancel, but i was told it's as easy as calling in before the monthly charge hits your account. plenty of cardio machines, all with tvs. lots of strength training equipment. their open/stretching area could use some work, it's the only indoor space available for stretching, plyometrics, jump roping, etc. they usually have good, commercial free, workout music playing inside the whole gym. free lockers and towels too."
5-star,1,"my wife found this place a few months back... she was just looking for a decent tanning salon close to our house in downtown phoenix... she mentioned to me that it had a small gym connected, and that i should look into a membership there since i was between gyms. finally, months later we decided to check it out together.... what she originally thought was a ""small"" gym, turned out to be a rather large gym, equipped with updated weight machines, benches, free weights, treadmills, etc! and the price cannot be beat!! it's a no brainer! plus we get 50% off tanning as gym members! which comes in handy for evening out that nasty tan line...."
5-star,1,"i really like this gym. just began going. i'm working with a personal trainer - lorel stevens. saw someone else mentioned her as well. she is fantastic! i moved gyms with her when the other place she worked closed. this gym is very clean and modern. the equipment looks new and is well maintained. typically in the mornings it isn't too crowded. the owners are very nice. while the place is small and doesn't offer classes like the large chains, it has a nice set up and is easy to work with machines or free weights. lots of cardio options. a workout area in the back where you can do some stretching, sit ups, etc. i think i'm really going to like this place!"
5-star,1,"recently my trainer moved gyms. i was hesitant about moving places because i really liked the intimacy of the former place. after visiting tangible tanning & fitness a few times i signed up for a membership. no contracts - love that! price was reasonable. the gym is relatively small. the cardio equipment have tvs attached so you can sweat and watch your favorite show. just plug in your own ear phones and away you go. i did look at a few other gyms in the area. the employees at la fitness were so rude when i didn't sign a contract on the spot. it was such a turn off. tangible fitness is family owned by a mother and her daughter (love that fact) to top it off, they are very nice. i'm just starting back to the gym after a few years of not doing anything. i love the fact that it is a comfortable enviornment with all shapes and sizes present. i especially like the variety of things to do there and i can set my own pace. yesterday it was boxing and weights. today was cardio and some yoga exercises. lorel stevens is my trainer there and she is the best!!! love her!"
4-star,1,update! apparently are now staying open! yay! looking for a new gym was depressing me! --------------------------- i just got word that tangible tanning & fitness is closing down the fitness center at the end of february... (tanning salon remain open) so depressed. finding a comparable gym will not be easy or fun! sad to see you go!
2-star,0,"staff at the front desk were friendly, but the facility is old and musty. the pool is closed until spring and the locker rooms were really gross and dirty. i wouldn't recommend coming here."
4-star,1,"i recently joined this ymca after being a member at an upscale gym (total woman) for 10 years. i really did not think i was going to like working out at the ""y"" at all. however, i was pleasantly surprised to find there is a great selection of free weights, nautilus equipment, and various other machines. what's also great is there are several work out floors/rooms, and they offer a variety of classes. mostly snowbirds and retirees work out at this location. however, there are some young people working out there too! this would be a great option for a family or a family with kids/teenagers, as they have a pool, pool table, and shuffle board at this location. in my opinion, the best part of this gym is the mellow vibe. everyone is cool and for females you won't have to worry about having unwanted males interrupting your set. however, you may still encounter some ""old dudes"" checking out your form!"
4-star,1,"i recently rejoined ymca because the price is affordable, the equipment is just what i need and i love how non judgmental this place feels. no makeup/selfie taking girls, and no guys huffing and puffing over at the weights. the building itself is sorta outdated and could use some work but in december they got new equipment (treadmills, bikes, etc) and it's a nice update."
2-star,0,"staff try to help but are often clueless about schedules, changes, events, programs. why is that? people at the front desk are our first line of defense for information and should not be clueless. they have programs to help kids but no one at the front desk knows anything about donations of funds or gifts. why? today i was told a gift donation program was cancelled, when in fact it was not. these are gifts for kids in need and to tell someone the program was cancelled hurts these kids. the program was not in the computer and the staffer only knew what he could find in the computer, and did not bother to listen to which program i was asking about. very dysfunctional y. to make things worse administrators don't respond to members' comments or ideas. why do they bother with a box for suggestions, if they ignore them--or maybe just toss them? and the major exercise classroom is freezing all the time!"
1-star,0,"sign up your kids for sports at this dysfunctional ymca if you want to be lied to, overcharged, shorted games, or given misinformation on a regular basis. corey jones, the so-called sports director, doesn't know what he is doing and he shouldn't be within 50 miles of any youth sports. he'll mess up your entire season and then offer up excuses and empty, long-winded apologies, when really he should be refunding money to unhappy parents. and good luck calling corey's bosses - they don't care. i contacted jim grosso (executive director), bryan soper (vice president of operations for valley of the sun ymca), and j. bryan madden (president / ceo of valley of the sun ymca), but none of them called me back. what a great way to deal with unhappy players, coaches and parents - just ignore them! the only good thing about this ymca is rich at the front desk."
2-star,0,tried to call today to find pool hours for open swim and got 5 minutes of self promotion voice mail. finally got to a live person that had no idea. transferred to another who also had no idea what open swim is. please answer the phone with someone who knows something about the ymca
5-star,1,"this is an outstanding facility with fantastic staff who are extremely accommodating. we held a corporate event here recently and were overwhelmed with their willingness to help us facilitate our function. the entire staff went above and beyond to work with us and assist in every way. i loved that they had racquetball courts - something i used to play many years ago and have struggled to find. it is a great indoor workout, especially when it is so hot during the az summers. forget your expensive gym membership and join the y. laura taylor is awesome and i am so appreciative of her help with our group. i can't wait to visit again!"
4-star,1,shout out to rich at the front desk! were always happy to see him and all the other employees for that matter. this gym may not be the nicest or have the best equipment but it gets the job done and we've made great relationships and really feel apart of the community since joining back in march 2014. we've been long time members of different y's across az and tx but there is definitely something special about this one! giving 4 stars since they could use various equipment additions and improvements. all in all a great place and i recommend.
4-star,1,smells a little funky each time i come in but i think that's because the facility is an older one. i drop off the kid i babysit here for basketball and he seems to love the court. someone always greets us cheerfully every time we come in and leave and that is a very inviting feeling. i haven't worked out here or used any of the things they have available but from what i've seen it looks great. the crowd is mixed age groups so i assume no one feels uncomfortable.
1-star,0,"gym = okay price = okay cancellation process = the most difficult, frustrating, irritating process i have been through with any gym. i processed the cancellation form with the gym, they did not cancel my membership. i called the gym, they did not cancel my membership. life happens and a few months go by. i call the gym again. it takes them several days of digging to find my membership form, and they have not returned any of my money even after promising to and have also charged me additional amounts for the year renewal. don't expect to be given more than the 3 months of your money returned (contractually obligated) either even though they've basically been stealing from you. i don't call that ""christian"", but it seems like they don't take that word too seriously. you think you can trust the front desk person to hold up their end of the bargain....nope, now they've dropped off the face of the earth. all in all, i advise you to go somewhere else if you ever want to change gyms or intend to move somewhere else. pissed off in mesa, courtney i am actually writing this post in the hopes that they care about social media and will address these very obvious problems in their cancellation process."
3-star,0,"this review is primarily directed at the strength training facilities at the tempe ymca. the location itself is nicely laid out with ample shaded parking, a plus in the summertime. inside is large with segregated workout areas, a plus when cardio and group classes are being held. as an active weight lifter, my primary area of concern was the strength training room. it was small by my standards, with majority of the room being filled with cardio equipment. the dumbbell rack was standard, ranging from 10 to 100 pounds. there was only one bench though for bench press and incline, something i hoped would be more of since they are quite common exercises for any weight lifter. all the equipment was clean though, and the noise level was minimum, with no children on the floor. all in all, a standard weight training room with decent weights. i would not recommend this facility if your workout encompasses anything more than baseline free weights. for active duty military, this facility offers free guest passes, which is very nice."
4-star,1,"been a member since 2003, originally at ahwatukee foothills. as an athlete (post collegiate hammer thrower, oh yeah!) i train at crossfit 347. however, since i can only manage driving out there 3 days as week, it's convenient to have a membership for those days i'm done throwing in mesa and need to get a workout in. very friendly, unintimidating atmosphere. someone always greets you. ryan aslan, one of the personal trainers is a pretty cool guy, and will stop by to catch up with everyone. great for families and free childcare. they have locker rooms, but you need to bring your own lock. there's a nice variety of group fitness classes available. favorites are zumba class with liz and kimberly on monday (5:30pm), wednesday (4:30pm) and saturday (8am). heidi also teaches a great cycle class. plenty of machines for all you cardio junkies out there! oh, that weight room . . . true, this is a ""normal people"" gym so don't expect to see any bumper plates, quality barbells or platforms for the olympic lifts. no big, my coach has me modify or go lighter with higher reps. one squat rack always equals a wait. like any typical gym, you'll see dudes doing curls on the squat rack and neglecting their legs. too funny. love that there's an auxiliary room for conditioning work. thanks for having lots of jump ropes and kettle bells; how awesome is that?! unlike other valley ymca locations, there seems to be less girl-on-girl cattiness. if it's happening i'm too busy working out to notice, but yeah. you won't even see stepford wives all decked out in lulu lemon, the entire mac counter on their faces and not breaking a sweat here. everyone's there to workout and get stuff done. sure, i've had a couple douchebros make offensive comments within earshot about me being the only female lifting . . . and lifting heavy! being feminine and strong aren't mutually exclusive events. duh. ;) recommended!"
3-star,0,"kind of a dive for a gym. very much outdated and cramped with low ceilings and a small workout space compared to most facilities. the gym is nice for what it is and the studios are as well. the staff is not very friendly, i am used to facilities that greet you as you come and go and i don't receive that here. also there is rarely staff in the work out area which i don't find to be normal. the equipment is fine, but nothing special. it is very tight and cramped, low ceilings make it feel even smaller. would not recommend to most people."
2-star,0,we are not members. we visited this location on recommendation from a friend for the parents night out program. i found the entire experience to be very disorganized. making reservations on the phone took over 15 minutes and being put on hold several times. when we arrived the night of it was hard to locate where we were suppossed to go. when we found the correct location it was quite chaotic and disorganized. my kids did have a nice time and i am confident they were treated well. we won't be back though.
4-star,1,"cool, so this is the first ymca i have ever been to, so i have nothing to compare it to. although i really don't need to compare it, as it does everything i need it to do. it has great equipment for working out. i mean state of the art. you can plug your ipod or usb drive into the equipment for music and fitness tracking! in addition, they have a children's center where you can drop off your kid while you work out, and the place is hardly ever busy! the guy at the front counter (my wife told me his name but i cant remember) went out of his way for me the other day and it was really appreciated! it seems like everyone there is cheerful and happy to help you with everything you need. the people that frequent this facility are extremely courteous, and clean the machines when they get done. i'm not kidding! i watched them! you don't get that kind of attitude at the gym on the corner! also, the classes are challenging and fun (i don't attend, but my wife does and she loves them!) this facility is really awesome, and for the price you can't beat it! do yourself a favor and quit your overcrowded, overpriced gym and join the y in tempe!"
4-star,1,"this is an organization with principles, where no one is turned away for an inability to afford membership (which is determined on a sliding scale). a place to come to for a wide variety of classes - from yoga to swimming to senior sessions. where kids are taken care of while you work out. a place that steroid-popping spandex freaks don't frequent as much. i didn't think the y really offered all that much until i went. i thought it'd be a facility with a kiddie pool and one treadmill we all had to share on rotation and with 72-hr advance reservation. it's not. you won't find a swanky cafe for example, but they do offer massages. the equipment is kept very clean but it's probably not the uber-most top-of-the-line. you will find personal training options without the desperate sales pitch. there will also be more families and kids - which i like. less of the psycho fitness addicts; more of the average jane or joe just trying to keep in shape. as far as this particular location is concerned, i think it suffices, although i prefer the y in mesa if you're on the east side. the tempe one feels somewhat...warehousey? a little spread out. i like the coziness of the mesa facility. and i love that i can frequent more than one, by the way. you can go to almost any ymca with your membership (check website for details). i vaguely remember the 24 hour fitness jerk telling me (during a horrendous sales pitch - see review) that one had to pay more for such a privilege. not the y. they make your effort to be fit and active affordable, simple, and stress-free."
5-star,1,i attended a class in their 1 year anniversary and it was amazing! perfect combo of weights and strength training. i highly recommend and will definitely be back!
5-star,1,"by far my favorite barre studio in the area! love all the different class types, and the environment is really uplifting! would highly recommend trying it out!"
5-star,1,"went for a trial class when i was staying across the street on a business trip. the tbc class was very challenging, but i didn't feel weird about modifying because everyone went at their own pace and adjusted the intensity up or down as needed. overall great experience, everyone was very friendly! i'll be back on my next trip to madison!"
5-star,1,"love the classes that they offer. love that they're expanding their times. love that most of the instructors seem to know me by name. all of the instructors are so energetic (but not in the weird/over the top/creepy way) and make great verbal adjustments. and their customer service is outstanding. if your looking for a welcoming place to get your fit on and be surrounded by really empowering people, look no further. ps go for their intro month discount for new members to test it out if you're questioning the commitment of their auto pay."
5-star,1,"this studio is absolutely amazing. i have been taking classes for over a month now and i'm loving all the different class formats. the barre code can definitely be considered a one stop shop/replacement for a gym membership. the different formats offer such versatility that i get cardio in one class (hiit) and strength training in another (the barre code) and then a little bit of both in another (tbc). another thing to rave about is the amazing instructors. they are all so nice and actually take the time to greet clients and ask how your day is. you don't always get that at gyms or other boutique studios. kellian, the owner is one of the nicest people i have met. she truly cares about everyone that walks in the door and most days (when she's not teaching) you can see her taking other classes, which is so awesome. overall the community at the barre code is second to none. the client base ranges from students to young professionals to active retirees (both men and women) which is so much fun! there are lots of modifications if you're unable to do certain moves and the instructors are so knowledgeable and are always walking around correcting technique and helping to push clients further. lastly, i always end up sore after taking classes. the great thing about the barre code is the workouts change weekly and each instructor has different choreography so you're rarely doing the same workout twice in a week. this keeps things interesting. the class goes by so quickly!! i would strongly suggest taking a class at the barre code and trying it out for yourself. i am so impressed with everything about this studio. you have to try it yourself."
5-star,1,"i love the barre code! kellian is an awesome instructor, she's always pushing you to work harder. serena is also great at keeping you motivated and ensuring proper form the barre code class is changed regularly so you never get to comfortable but it is always a challenge!"
5-star,1,"i love this place and it's changing my life! where do i start? i'm not the kind of girl that likes to work out and pushing myself in an athletic way hasn't been something i've done regularly... maybe ever. i'm in my mid-thirties now and shit is getting real. i sit at a desk all day and feel pretty shitty physically most of the time, i have chronic pain issues and autoimmune stuff that leaves me feeling exhausted and like i should just crawl into bed and never leave, but this is finally something that works for me and things are really turning around! i feel amazing when i finish a workout there. if i could go everyday i honestly would. i love kellian's classes because she is super motivating and pushes me harder than i ever thought i could go and i still want to come back. also you work super hard and it's over in 50 minutes and you feel amazing when you're done. the workouts are always changing so you're always challenged. i'm working muscles i never knew i had and i'm seeing results so quickly it's kind of blowing my mind. i'm into it like i've never been before and i'm going to keep showing up and being proud of how much i can do. so happy i found this place!"
5-star,1,my wife and i started truhit a few months ago and we are loving it. scott and his team are awesome. the childcare makes it really convenient and my kids love going there. i would definitely recommend working out here.
5-star,1,"my husband and i have gone to truhit for over three years now, and we love it! everyday is a completely different workout, and it keeps things interesting. its also a fantastic workout! as someone who has worked out my entire life and i consider myself to be decently fit, it's a challenge! i really like the feeling of working out with a team, and that's what you get here. there's comradery and encouragement among all of the members! it's a very positive, judgement free workout space. another huge positive is that there are a variety of fitness levels among the members, and you just tailor the workout to your level. i actually worked out the entire time i was pregnant and was able to modify throughout the pregnancy. the trainers are super knowledgeable, and really watch your form while you workout, which is critical. the owner, scott, really practices what he preaches and lives a healthy lifestyle!"
5-star,1,"addicted to these workouts. best results i've ever had. love the positive environment, community of friends i've made and being challenged daily. ""those who stay will be champions""."
5-star,1,"scott and his team are fantastic. the whole place is geared to help you succeed, all you need to do is show up. scott will walk you through how to eat, how to rest and how to get in better shape, all without judgment or guilt. while i haven't been able to go as much as i would like lately, i look forward to getting back into his gym asap."
5-star,1,"i'm in my 2nd week here, and really love the workouts. if you're trying to lose weight, and want to avoid heavy lifting...then this is your perfect gym. lots of functional movements with kettlebells, trx straps, medicine balls, and other essential equipment. definitely excited to see where this takes me."
2-star,0,"i responded to a job ad as a health coach, as i went to school for nutrition, i figured this was a legit job in the nutrition industry. i showed up to what i realized was a gym, along with 15-20 other people to listen to an herbalife sales pitch from the owner of the gym... although everyone seemed very nice, i didn't appreciate being lured in through a job posting, thinking i was coming from an interview, to find out that all they are doing is trying to add herbalife members to their team so that they can make money off of you. i tried one of the shakes, and it was pretty good, however, they expect you to replace whole meals with shakes... you are only losing weight because you are drinking low calorie protein shakes instead of eating real food.... i agreed to come back a second day to meet with someone one on one to see what it was really about. all he did was take all of my stats- weight, bmi, height etc... and then sell me an herbalife package and distribution id. $75 dollars later, i find myself giving money to the place that i thought would be paying me as an employee. they are ""training"" people and telling them that if they do what they say, you too will lose a bunch of weight and be able to sell herbalife yourself after that and share your story, and become a ""health coach""... you have to go through and complete their whole program and allow them to train you and sell you herbalife before you can even become a health coach. the best part about it? you have to figure out how to get clients all by yourself. they expect you to wear these dumb pins on your shirt that advertise herbalife, and they expect that that will lure people into asking you about it and then you would have to sign them up. it's no different than selling avon or mary kay. they want you to have parties at your house and try to get people to buy herbalife. it's more about the product than the actual health coaching. it's ridiculous. these people have no credential in nutrition, no dtr, no rd, no md, and some don't even have their personal training license... not only is that not safe for the people that come into their gym expecting a qualified person to train them, it is unethical to work in the nutrition/health industry without a credential or degree in nutrition/dietetics. i feel bad posting this review because everyone that i met did seem very nice, but i just can't take it anymore watching all of these people go and get nutrition advice from people who have no legal credential or ethical right to be able to even call themselves ""health coaches"". you wanna be a health coach? go earn a bachelors and then get back to me."
5-star,1,"i've been going to this gym for over a year now. this is the first gym that i have gone to and stuck with. i have always been a wonderer at gyms..wondering around from one piece of equipment to another without really knowing what i should be doing. i love that this place has everything set up for you when you go to class. it takes all of the guess work out of what i need to be doing. the sense of community within this organization is amazing. everyone is nice, and genuinely happy to see you. there are people of all different fitness levels participating in the workouts so there is never any judgment. i would highly recommend them.. they also have daycare available at certain times."
5-star,1,"i am absolutely in love with this gym! i signed up for the 30 day challenge and i'm on day 15 and could not be happier. they are so encouraging and always push you to be the best you can be. i really enjoy how there are people working at all levels. there are people who are just starting out and others who are extremely fit athletes. regardless of your experience and fitness, everyone comes out being challenged and stronger. all of the coaches are so helpful and make sure you are doing the workouts properly and safely. scott is extremely patient, engaging and truly cares about your success. i cannot wait to finish out the month and i hope to continue my fitness journey with truhit!"
5-star,1,"i've worked out at plenty of gyms during my life. truhit is by far the most enjoyable experience i've had at a gym. the workouts are challenging, but most importantly each trainer takes the time to get to know you personally. the other thing that makes them stand out is even if they meet you once, they will remember your name. scott runs a fantastic operation, and if you stick to going to the same class you'll make some great friends. if you're looking for a gym that will bring challenging, ever-changing workouts that leave you gasping for air during and after, this is the place! highly recommend."
2-star,0,this is a good gym for people that are just getting started and have been out of fitness since the starting of club memberhsips. i dont feel the vibe and i dont like being feel pressured to buy worthless products like herbalife. nothings for free thats for sure.
1-star,0,"it is close to work so i gave it a try and found it sucked do to the following reasons. 1. i found the facility sparse with almost no equipment i considered it substandard do to this. 2. the constant sales push of the overpriced supplements made me feel like i was at an amway convention. 3. every other gym i have been to was much better and had more equipment, friendlier and more competent staff, no constant sales push etc.."
4-star,1,"i completed the january challenge and it was great. a friend told me about it and there is location nearby my house so i decided to try it out. they do an initial evaluation: weight, body fat, muscle mass, measurements, push-ups, sit-ups and a mile run. you attend classes at least 3x/week, flexible for any schedule with classes 6 days a week and in the morning and afternoon. each workout day focused on either upper body, lower body, or all body/cardio. leg day was my fave. they change up the exercises so you never get bored, and use equipment like trx, rowing machine, dumbbells, kettle bells, medicine balls, jump ropes, boxes, and your own body. either you do a certain amount of each exercise or you do it for a specified period of time. sometimes they do partner exercises. after a month, you come to evaluation day and they take all the stats again. i'm happy that i gained muscle, which was my goal. they give prizes to the top 3 finishers who lost the most weight, lost the most body fat percentage, and improved on their times for the cardio. staff is friendly, welcoming and very helpful during the workouts. the trainers are supportive and make sure you're doing the exercises correctly. i recommend you do their challenge or do a trial to see if you like them. i really like this place but it's expensive for me to commit to right now. if you sign up for a meal plan, the monthly rate is reduced. you definitely get what you pay for, which is a quality workout and good results."
4-star,1,"super intense workout with lots of motivational support. i joined their 30 day free fitness challenge, and on my 3rd workout, i could no longer bend down to sit on the toilet or couch. getting up out of bed or my chair was impossible. so yes, you will get a massive workout. the only thing i don't like, which is just personal preference, is that you have to partner up with others when doing activities. i prefer an environment where i can stick my head phones in and work out solo. but that's just me. if you don't want to make friends and want to do it on your own, this is not the program for you. if you want to workout until you fall over, this is the place for you!!!"
5-star,1,holy cow. upper body day. i had a hard time lifting my dork to eat my dinner. my arms r dead lol. great class once again
4-star,1,i signed up for a free week membership. wanting to participate in their weight loss nutrition counseling. i have called their office 3 times and the president once as well as a text and have left multiple vm's with the office. it's been 3 days since with no word from anyone. their counselor was suppose to call me to schedule an appt for the program. so far no call backs or texts despite multiple efforts i received a call from the owner of the gym. i've had to have unexpected surgery so i can't do anything physical for quite awhile. i was impressed he took the time to reach out. i would suggest giving them a try.
5-star,1,"the workouts here are great, and for anyone. everyone does the same thing but you can kind of go at your own pace and you are never racing against anyone. the people are very friendly and you will definitely notice a change after the first week. i workout regularly at many different high intensity classes, and my muscles have been sore after several of these classes! get a living social or groupon or just try it for a week. that is how i tried it and i was hooked after a few classes."
5-star,1,"this is by far the most success i have ever had with one gym. the trainer tim deloch is amazing! the workouts combine a hybrid of crossfit & trx training over a one hour period. additionally, it a great positive group of individuals. let's face it everyone has busy days and eating is something we think of last, and it affects our energy and lifestyle. this gym is really supportive as a group. lots of fun people just trying to stay healthy! i like this gym because it covers, nutrition, fitness training and the support of attendees and trainers is out standing! use referral code # 132068: for a free week or try their 30 day fit challenge. (that is how i got started.)"
5-star,1,"amazing gym. the space and equipment is up to date, clean and well maintained. the trainers are truly passionate about their business. boris the owner is friendly, positive and committed to his trainees. they also have the best sound system than any gym around you can work out to chest pounding music and 3 big tvs show the daily workout."
5-star,1,this gym is a true workout for every level of ability. the instructors give assistance with correct form throughout the work out! tori is my favorite instructor. it has a very friendly staff and you feel like part of a community working out there. everyone is positive and encouraging!
5-star,1,i attended my first class monday with adam for an upper body workout which went well. i wasn't sure what to expect because there are mixed reviews. this is a community of like minded individuals who want to see you succeed and do your best. i struggled with my form and adam was there to guide and direct me in a very positive and supportive way another young lady who worked there helped me out as well. i most likely would have given up after 30 minutes but being with a group and trainer pushes you through the tough times. friendly people in the class. clean facilities. also spin classes which are separate from a truhit membership and last but not least a nutrition bar with no pushy salespeople. way to go to the whole crew at truhit fitness in scottsdale!
1-star,0,"i am a full time mom of a newborn baby and i have one hour a day where i get to have time to myself. i came to jenny's class (truhit scottsdale/platinum location) because i believed she could support me in my road to regaining my strength back. not only did she attempt to discourage me, but it was also a form of bullying. she humiliated me, i felt extremely uncomfortable and upset. mind you, this is my first time at this facility and jenny has never met me before. it shocks me that as a head trainer/owner she would go out of her way to single me out, call me out, and ask me to leave the class if i am unable to perform a certain push-up due to my postnatal loss of strength. she harassed me and questioned whether or not i wanted to get strong and if i couldn't respect her class then i should leave. no trainer should ever make anyone feel this way. i will not be returning to this facility in the future. i just wanted to share my situation because it is unfair for it to happen to anyone else, let alone a mom who leaves her baby at 6 in the morning to try to be healthier for her newborn baby."
1-star,0,"canceling has been a nightmare and it appears it's still not resolved. my boyfriend was just offered a really great job in atlanta. we decided it was worth moving out there so i told scott at the truhit on 79th street, he said no problem i'll get your membership canceled. he said i needed to call this gym on mcdonald to cancel my spin membership. i called this gym 1/23, 1/24, 1/25. 1/26, 1/27, 1/28 and left a voicemail. i finally got a response when i missed a call from them on 1/30. the message was from hannah who promised that my membership would be canceled but she also told me to go online to fill out the cancellation, which i did immediately! 2/13 truhit on mcdonald pulls $40 from my account for spin. i call again 2/13, leave a message, 2/14 leave a message, again 2/14 am given one of the owners phone numbers, jeremy, of course jeremy doesn't answer or call me back. i call again 2/15 leave a message. call again 2/15 am told one of the owners is there jen and that she'll call me back. i try her again hours later and am being told she's really busy and is in and out. ok, what about me? what about the paying customer that was loyal to your gym until i found out i have to move states? i don't have a lot to do with packing up a house, selling it and working on the logistics of moving across the country. my time isn't valuable? i should have to drag this out until possibly after i've left az for good? this gym is acting like i'm leaving because i hate the gym. i've loved working out at truhit and wished there was one in atl. after this experience i would absolutely never return to this gym. i'm not sure why my $40 was worth all of this. why would a gym do this?"
5-star,1,"i've been coming to truhit for over a year and a half and love it. the workouts consistently challenge me and i have seen improvement in my form and the amount of weight i am able to lift. great workout, music, energy, and people --definitely recommend it to athletes of all levels!"
2-star,0,"i had a very unpleasant experience my first time here. the set up is pretty typical for a boot camp-style class, with trx, mats, and dumbbells. the instructor explained the moves in the circuit, not problem so far. one of the push up moves i was performing incorrectly. i like it when the instructor cares enough to correct my form, but i did have a problem with the instructor repeatedly telling me, ""everyone else here is doing the work, you're not doing the work."" i'm no slacker when working out, but i just felt berated and defensive. i mentioned that i had copied what my partner had done, to which i was told, ""i'm the instructor here ma'am."" yikes! i have never walked out of a workout before. i left a message to speak with the owner/manager, but i did not get a return call."
5-star,1,"i've been coming to truhit a few times a week for the past 2.5 months and i am addicted. the trainers are great, and i've met a lot of really cool people in the classes. it's an added bonus to see familiar faces every time i walk in the room. one of my favorite things about this place is that the classes are filled with beginners all the way to super buff athletes but i never feel intimidated. everyone is so friendly and helpful. the exercises are ones that i wouldn't typically think to do on my own or even know how to do on my own but they are results-driven. i've definitely gained some muscle mass, lost some weight and am able to lift more weight than i ever have in the past if i could describe this gym in three words, they would be unpretentious, encouraging & challenging. note: no one has ever pushed the herbalife products on me. i became obsessed with the protein shakes all on my own after trying the oatmeal cookie and chocolate mint shakes at truhit. )"
4-star,1,"huge space, and the staff is very friendly. the shakes and teas are delicious as well. my overall favorite part is the motivation goal white board. i love reading what others are working towards and how they hold them selves accountable. i look forward to cross fit friday and spin saturday!"
5-star,1,best place for spinning. tuesday at 5:30 with jessica is my favorite part of my day. it's totally affordable and the staff is so nice. i take everyone who is interested in cycling here. don't hesitate. it's totally worth it.
5-star,1,i wish there was a gym like truhit near me in atlanta. the staff and the classes there are amazing. the spin class with lindzi everett was awesome and super motivating. i also tried a fit bootcamp class and it was challenging but encouraging. the whole group was welcoming. everyone worked hard and it was very motivating. i'm so thankful i had the opportunity to go to truhit and will return when i come back to arizona!
5-star,1,"i have gone to many gyms, and this gym is truly unique! every member is supportive and you truly get a well rounded work out all week! also, the workouts are 100% different everyday! i never get bored!"
5-star,1,"i love this gym!! i started the 30 day challenge in july 2015. i've lost 30 pounds and my body shape has changed as well. i'm so much stronger than i was. i have more energy and stamina. both the staff and the members are friendly and helpful. the workouts are always different, never boring and can be modified if you have preexisting injuries."
5-star,1,"5 stars isn't enough to rate this, i'd give it 10 stars if i could. this place has changed my life and has gotten me into a healthier lifestyle. i had a lower back surgery, a disc replacement and disc fusion at my l5-s1, in february 2015. for years, i haven't been able to do much exercise due to my back problems, my health and my strength wasn't there anymore. enough was enough, i decided that when i started feeling able, that i needed a change. that's when i was introduced to truhit. the trainers made me instantly feel comfortable and i knew i had their support from the minute i stepped in. even in classes of 20 or more, the trainer leading in each class always kept an eye on me and my form to ensure i didn't cause any more injury to my back and kept me positive when i was struggling. i started at 20% body fat and struggled mightily through the work outs, but with the support i received i dropped to 12% in just a few months and handling the workouts with more ease. i got an ego boost and my confidence has come back. everyone here, from staff to members, become family and provide you with a community that can't be matched anywhere else. this gym has become my second home and wouldn't have it any other way. you won't regret stepping your foot into the doors here."
2-star,0,"tried this gym only because classes were cheap. the girl who taught the morning class, (can't remember her name, she was in okay shape... jamie?jenny?), screamed at everyone for talking during warm up. not quite my cup of tea. the workouts are very similar to my usual gym, bodi, however bodi has a much more positive/comfortable/fun vibe. depends what you're going for.."
5-star,1,i did the free 30day challenge in september 2015 and loved it! i didn't feel pressured to sign up or to do anything. i loved the support from the trainers especially jen. she is always available when i have questions or in need of nutrition advice. i would definitely recommend this gym to anyone and to at least try the 30 day challenge.
5-star,1,this place will change your life!!! i have tried many gyms in the valley and nothing compares to truhit platinum!!! it is a family community and a one stop shop for all of your fitness goals!!! do yourself a favor and check out the free 30 day trial! it's seriously free for 30 days! i thought the same thing! what is the catch? there is no catch! i knew i couldn't leave after a week of doing the training! it is like no other gym!
5-star,1,"love the workouts. always challenging and fun. great people, great atmosphere. it feels like a big family working out together."
5-star,1,"i don't usually leave yelp reviews, but truhit platinum/central scottsdale really deserves it. this place changed my life! i first joined them during a 30-day free fitness challenge and they gave me so much more than fun workouts. they helped me get in the best shape i've ever been; they helped me believe i was stronger than i thought; they supported me in ways no other gym has; and ultimately, they helped me lose (and keep it off) 60+lbs. they've never pressured me into anything and never tried to sell something i wasn't interested in buying. they simply support my goals and help me stay motivated. i love this place - the people and workouts are the best. i highly recommend it to anyone who want to challenge themselves into being in the best shape of their lives and become the best version of themselves."
5-star,1,i love this place! the workouts are fun and my body has changed so much. it's affordable and total worth the free 30 day challenges they have every other month
5-star,1,this gym is amazing and gets you the results your looking for!! the workouts are fun and there is always a great group of friends to workout with!!
5-star,1,this is an absolutely awesome gym to go to the workouts are intense yet it keeps you wanting to come back every day the people here are purely amazing they have been a major part and very important to my life
5-star,1,"amazing coaches and accountability partners promoting healthy active lifestyle, nutrition, hiit, and now spin cycling!! best place ever - you must stop in for free class and shake"
5-star,1,"this is the best gym i've ever been to hands down. you come here you're getting results. all the staff is super friendly. it's a fun atmosphere to be in. group classes that really push you to your limits. the members all support each other, and hangout and socialize after the workout... its awesome! i've never been to a gym where the owners and trainers will be taking the class right along side you sweating it out themselves. top notch gym! i recommend giving it a try"
1-star,0,"i have lived in az for years and been to many different gyms/programs as i like to stay fit. i checked this place out after given a free one week pass when they opened near me inside an old auto parts store. it is mostly an empty room with a rubber mat and about 5 rowing machines and a couple bar stools to sit in while they try to up sell supplements.. they have very little to offer- almost no equipment, rude staff, heavily pushed over priced supplements etc... i found the staff was both very rude and aggressive. i was offered no assessment, almost no equipment to use -just a class to do calisthenics with a few others while watching some rude so called instructor rant about while trying to push the very overpriced supplements. in one class the woman was so aggressive i suspected steroid use. i couldn't prove it but the behavior was in my opinion indicative of it. whats also stunning is even the almost free club sar gym scottsdale offers just two minutes away for 20 dollars a month or 99 dollars a year (scottsdale residents) is 1000 times what this facility is. it has 1000 times more equipment, more and better staff, more fitness programs, larger, nicer etc etc... every gym i have ever been a member of puts this place to shame in all aspects. in summary my recommendation would be to go almost anywhere else! or if this is what you want just by any tape from a late night infomercial. i expect this place wont stay open long. p.s my understanding is employees ""from all locations"" are required to post 5 star yelp reviews thus deceiving the public into thinking this place has something to offer."
5-star,1,"workouts are amazing, people are awesome, and trainer is hot!!!!! they have a great post workout nutrition shop inside as well. they also have amazing promotions to try the gym out for cheap!"
5-star,1,"great gym with a friendly, skilled and fun staff and coaches. i've be doing martial arts and boxing for 20 years and enjoy working out here as there's always a way to keep improving. classes are a fun and great workout for any level fitness. there's a good mix of experienced and real fighters, mid-level and beginners here for a variety of training options. brandon, val and ryan's classes are awesome! no attitudes and a welcoming vibe. check it out and have fun!"
5-star,1,i joined about 3 weeks ago! this place is awesome! they truly care about there members. i was skeptical about joining only due to the fact that i didn't want the employees to change the way they were when i signed up to everyday when i came in. brandon! is awesome! i am so thankful i found a gym with him in it! if it weren't for him i wouldn't go there! within my first two weeks i lost 4 pounds. i am going to be doing personal training with him and again he is absolutely awesome. truly cares about what you want to accomplish and doesn't have that rude cocky attitude. such a down to earth hard working guy! so happy! and not to mention robert the owner! he is so kind and has been ever since i started! big plus plus is there is a shower and lockers. love you guys and so happy to have found this amazing gym!!!!!!
5-star,1,"i was 205lbs at 5'9"" when i joined and was extremely out of shape. the coaches and classes here helped me lose 30lbs in just 5 months! the classes are really fun and helpful with technique(something i was lacking) and motivation to push yourself to your limits. the coaches and staff are very very nice and were more than willing to help with everything i asked about. it is a really good way to get all your aggression out and be healthy at the same time! i love the gym and the ufc"
5-star,1,i recently signed my kids up here and they absolutely love it. the trainers are extremely patient and clearly passionate about what they do. they encourage and compliment the kids and also correct them when needed. very clean and well kept. much more inviting and friendly then other gyms i've been to! pricing is more than fair. highly recommend!
5-star,1,"this is a great gym. the staff is friendly and knowledgeable. there is a good variety of classes and plenty of equipment to do your own thing. and unlike a lot of other gyms, there's the opportunity to spar with another member. i love this place!"
5-star,1,"i join this amazin sport center 2 months ago, i ve never done martial arts before, first of all management and coaches are very hand and they have great knowledge on their work with passion, they are not having you kick the bags an hour long they teach you what they know and philosophy behind it. now i have different point of view on martial arts just because or ufc gyms positive impact thanks to adrian and his fellow co workers and all my coaches you guys doing amazing job"
5-star,1,"i've had a positive experience from the start. all the staff members are easy going and very welcoming. the idea of walking into a fight gym can be very intimidating. the classes can be aimed towards anyone that's new to fitness/fighting and those wanting to train harder. i'm never bored in the classes and the coaches pay attention to each individual, providing as much guidance as possible. they've helped my husband and i fit in and learn the basics of each class and from there on how to make it more intense at our own pace. it's good to see that the gym has gained popularity and filled with great many people but it does limit the space available during some classes, which can feel overwhelming/crowded. i like that they host events throughout the month such as self defense classes, an anti bullying class, ufc showing parties, and classes that allow you to invite your friends and family for free. (a casual gym-goer)"
5-star,1,"time for an update...after 1 month. ok, i've lost about 5 pounds and gotten into noticeably better shape, even though i've always been pretty dedicated to fitness. i love this gym. 1. the front desk staff knows me by name and cheerfully greets me whenever i walk thru the door (unheard of). 2. classes are varied, well attended, and awesome...and all included in my membership. 3. instructors are amazing...charlie swanton and thiago ximenez make this my favorite place to be. thanks for making this my home away from home, family friendly, best gym ever."
5-star,1,this is a great gym. i am a member in san diego and this gym has equipment that sd does not have. i only go on monday's and the instructors are great.
5-star,1,i was a member of la boxing before bought out by ufc gym. this new gym is under new ownership and management and i am blown away by this place. the class coaches are extremely knowledgeable and give the right amount of encouragement. the other gym members are approachable and helpful much like you would find at a crossfit type gyms. the equipment you can see is all top of the line state of the art stuff along with their free weights. the mma classes fit anyone's schedule. what i really love about this gym is each class is unique and different so you will never have that repetitive feeling. i would highly recommend this gym to anyone.
5-star,1,"state of the art weight equipment. the staff is great and highly knowledgeable, i've been to gyms all over and won't go anywhere else now, the price is reasonable and the staff can work with you on certain things."
5-star,1,the facility is awesome with up to date and new versions of equipment. the owner and staff are always up beat and positive. the trainers are highly qualified to train and get you into the shape you are looking for.
5-star,1,"i first started with the 21 day challenge, initially i was just looking for a few ways to spice up my work outs and put some pep in my step. i was impressed with the thorough consultation and richelle's analysis of my needs and limitations. i am not a person that is in amazing shape, but i never feel like i can't do the work outs. she modifies them to your needs. the classes themselves are interesting and challenging. i especially love the camaraderie with the other campers. its a lovely gaggle of women and feels very empowering. i would definitely recommend trying out the ultimate body bootcamp. you, your body and your health will be thankful for it."
5-star,1,"ultimate body bootcamp is the best work out. its never the same workout. richelle is available with nutrition help. i started with a groupon and have now been a member for a little over a year. richelle takes the time to meet with each member to come up with attainable goals and measures progress monthly. the other members are great, i was nervous at first but felt welcomed and felt comfortable with the other bootcampers."
5-star,1,this has been the one workout that gives me enough variety and support to show-up! two plus years and going strong! you won't be sorry for trying ubbc and you'll be even more happy with your results.
5-star,1,"ultimate body bootcamp is the only thing that has ever worked for me as far as a workout routine. i am not a typical ""gym"" person. i got a groupon way back in 2010 and only thought i would do the month. i wound up signing up for much more. at the time i was recovering from a back injury and it was the only thing that helped me get stronger. after awhile i took some time off to have a child and didn't go back to ubbc until january 2013. at that time, i was so weak because i had been on bed rest with my pregnancy and had gained a bunch of weight. i never thought i would get back into shape. i was truly scared. i saw a post on facebook for a ubbc challenge, emailed richelle, the owner/trainer to tell her about my fear and how i had gained so much and my muscles had become so weak from my pregnancy. she eased my fears and said she would work with me. i wound up losing. 20 lbs of baby weight in just 3 months. i noticed i got stronger and my back felt better than it had since the 2011, the last time i was in bootcamp. the thing that i like best about ubbc is the camaraderie and the one on one assistance and attention. the owner, richelle posts nutrition articles, recipes, etc. on the facebook page, and really wants people to succeed. it is a fun atmosphere and people cheer each other on. the strength training richelle teaches is awesome. i totally notice a difference in how i carry myself as a result. i have taken a couple months off to start a business, and i can tell my back has been bothering me again because i haven't been in bootcamp. i need to get back because it is the only thing that has worked for me, even after 1000s of dollars in chiropractic and massage therapies. this is a great local business that supports other local businesses. there are always posts on the ubbc website/fb page about giving to charities and helping out causes. do not feel intimidated to try this out. richelle works with people of all levels and there is no embarrassment. i also love the variety of people and ages in the camps."
5-star,1,"i originally signed up for ultimate body bootcamp in april 2011. after 3-4 months i stopped going because it was hard for me to make it after work and i was ""sure"" there were more convenient options out there. basically...i had plenty of excuses. fast forward to february 2013, i had: joined and quit a gym, tired bikram yoga at every studio in the valley, taken kickboxing and trx classes and spent countless hours doing cardio in my apartment complex's gym. i realized that i hadn't found anything better and that i'm just not someone that can keep themselves motivated on my own. so i gave in and began taking classes at ultimate body bootcamp again the following month. what really keeps me coming back is the fact that i haven't reached a plateau. it's a killer workout and isn't repetitive because each class is different than the last. the class environment is fun, friendly and challenging. richelle (the owner) is fantastic and encourages you to push yourself and really make each workout count. she is a wealth of knowledge about both fitness and nutrition. i've been taking classes at ultimate body bootcamp for nine straight months now and can say that i'm still just as sore after each class as i was the first week. i've made tremendous progress and am stronger than i've probably ever been. i can even say that i recently made the plunge into commitment and signed up for a full year of classes."
5-star,1,"i found ultimate body boot camp through groupon - i thought it was a great deal. i chose the windgate crossing location, and it is definitely a challenging workout! what i love the most is that ray gives a challenging workout, pushes you to do the best you can, but isn't obnoxious or in your face like the other boot camp i went to in north phoenix. he's tough in a way that is motivating, not discouraging. i also love how richelle, the owner, is so smart about nutrition. i have tried diet after diet over the years, talked to nutritionists, etc. and i learned more from richelle about how eating affects your body than i did from anyone else."
5-star,1,"this review is written by a former skeptic--thinking boot camp would consist of aerobic dancing and yoga. . . i was mistaken. the ultimate body boot camp (ubbc) is an intense, fast paced full body workout that is often grueling. it rivals 2 a day football practices, condensed into an hour. within 4 weeks, i saw dramatic improvements in both cardiovascular endurance and strength, and quickly lost weight. it is never boring, and richelle is great and highly amusing. the one nit--6:30 a.m. or 7 p.m. classes por favor! i recommend!"
5-star,1,"my first experience with ultimate body bootcamp (ubbc) was through a groupon i purchased in spring 2010 - i paid $19 (i had a $10 credit) for a month of bootcamp classes. although working out at 5:30am was not my idea of fun, the location was super convenient and i really came to enjoy it. each day was similar in nature, but featured different activities so i never got bored or knew what was coming. dr. mary king and jen were great instructors - friendly, knowledgeable, and positive. near the end of my month of classes, they merely suggested signing up for the next month - no guilt trips or pressure to pay for another month or more. and the greatest part was that ubbc offered a great promo price for those who wanted to keep going, so i purchased another month! groupon just offered another ubbc deal and i'm signed up to go again in april! if you missed these deals, keep your eyes open for ubbc (and other bootcamp) deals on the ""deal"" sites!"
5-star,1,"ultimate body bootcamp provides incredible workouts, support and fun! working out with a group of people helps me stay motivated. i also like all of the additional ways to get involved in an active lifestyle - newsletters with good nutrition info, short or long races, hikes, charity bootcamp, and more. camps are valley wide. check out the 2010 best of the valley winner - your body will ultimately thank you for it!"
5-star,1,"great place to get fit and learn some self defense! the people range from beginners to world class kickboxers. so whether you've done martial arts before or not, they do a great job making you feel welcome. i highly recommend ultimate for those looking for something different from a typical gym"
5-star,1,"a good casual atmosphere and a great work out. i've been going here for a month now and my technique is looking better and better with every visit. i would recommend going when derek is training if you are a beginner, hes one of the more forgiving trainers. if you are looking to get your but kicked buy your workout, then i would suggest mani, my abs took a good three days to recover."
3-star,0,"went here to try out muay thai for the first time; i attended the women's only class. great instructor (joey). very helpful at pointing out ways to improve my technique. although i'm a beginner, it's better to have good technique from the beginning so i don't get bad habits, lol. one issue, though, is that the class was quite full so it was hard to get help/attention sometimes when i needed it; luckily i was paired with a more advanced student who was able to offer me tips. lots of classes available at various times throughout the day, but it's probably good to call in advance since classes are sometimes cancelled without notice. front desk staff was nice and helpful too. i thought it was a fun experience and i'd probably try it again, but note that for complete beginners (which i kinda am, but kinda am not, since i've done something similar before) it can be a bit tricky if you don't know the names of the moves or whatever. so it would be good to pair with a more advanced student or, if the class is not too busy, get help directly from the instructor."
4-star,1,"great atmosphere and great fun. i've been going to the location in north york and i love how supportive everyone is, how dedicated the instructors are to making sure you're doing it right, and the crazy kickass workout that you go through before and after practice. i'm totally pushed to my limit in every single class. this is my first time taking muay thai, but i've been doing martial arts on and off all my life. i like that people here are actually serious about technique. seeing other people excel goes a long way in keeping me focused. i'm a few weeks in at roughly 2-3 classes a week, and even though my body hates me right now, i love it!"
4-star,1,great atmosphere and friendly + helpful staff! i've never tried muay thai before and the instructors took the time to get me on track. i was surprised of how great of a cardio / strength workout it was compared to when i was working out at goodlife.
1-star,0,"don't buy the team buy $20 for 20 classes! i bought it once and after i tried 2 classes the instructor from scarborouh site told me and my friend that we had to sign a contract to pay approx. $30 a month else we cannot continue to go to classes. also he said we need to do all the classes with in 2 months! the expiry date written on team buy was in sept 2012/13. this contract was not written on team buy. the man told us that this was not his problem and told us to get a refund from team buy. this is place is called ""ultimate martial arts"". please comment if you have experienced a similar situation. thanks."
2-star,0,"there was a deal going on awhile back on one of the coupon websites, so i bought a $30 for 30 classes card. a friend of mine who is already a member at uma finally got me to get off my couch and redeem my voucher... located in an industrial strip of scarborough and not having a very visible sign, i overshot the place, and had to do a u-turn. when i pulled up to the studio, the windows were all steamed up... was i at a hot yoga studio? the place is very casual. its basically a reception desk, with one big open room that has a punching bag, a boxing ring, and a huge matted area for the kickboxing and muy thai classes. i attended the 8:30pm class tonight, which was slightly less crowded than the 7:30pm class. the class ran for an hour. in terms of instruction, i think that this would be a very intimidating experience for a newbie. the class was male-dominated, and most of the guys had been members for some time, so i'm glad that i came with a friend who would tolerate my not-so-suave moves. think, intimidating is to guy who goes to a hot yoga class... this was infinitely worse! the class starts off with a warm-up series consisting of jogging on the spot, high knees, back kicks, jumping jacks, and lunges. you repeat this twice. you then transition into jabs, cross punches and hooks. after this phase is over, you grab a partner. you will do a series of cross punches, hooks, and switch kicks. the kicks were the hardest part for me, as for some reason my toes didn't want to pivot. i got quite frustrated, but was lucky that my partner was very patient with me. i could see how someone could be discouraged from ever coming back again with the lack of instruction and care given by the staff. however, i did break a good sweat, and the hour flew by really fast. i would definitely take one of these classes over a long and boring one hour jog that probably burns a lot less calories!"
1-star,0,"if i could give them no stars i would. todd is the most arrogant person i have met. he does not return calls when he says he will. i called on a refund of $200. when i called and had to give my name he happened to be busy. when i called back and used a fake name he was amazingly available. mike kikes the owner is not any better. i guess $200 is worth more to him than a bad review on this site and our hoa site that reached over 11,900 people that lives in his back yard. i had to post on mike's personal and company facebook, and had to send an email on their company website to call me. he finally called me back. then he had to review my file and was going to call me back. mike did not, i had to call him back. at least i did not have to use a fake name this time. they have the worst customer service. there is a new gym going in on reems and bell. much cheaper and what i hear better customer service. i will never go back to this gym nor will i recommend them. they are not a company of integrity or honesty."
5-star,1,"this gym is solid. it has a decent repetoire of machines and free weights. even when the place is busy, you can still find things to do. i don't have much experience with the staff but the other patrons of this establishment are usually polite. the layout of the gym is pretty good and it is fairly clean. the bathrooms and daycare are on the far right of the gym. next to it are the free weights amd some bicep machines. there are 3 adjustable benches for bench press. the have a few different leg machines and a smith machine. in the center of the gym, there is a power cage for all your powerlifting needs in there is where you will find metal weights. there are a few cable cross over machines next to a few hammer machines. for you who like treadmills and stairstepper, they have those. the gym also has two other rooms which usually house classes ofnsome sort. i am not sure of those since i do my own thing. overall, i am very happy with my neighborhood gym. the fees are low. the parking lot is huge. the gym has everything i need. the only suggestions for the gym would be to change out a few benches."
1-star,0,"i was so happy to have a gym right around the corner from my house. i was so pumped to check this place out. there was two men at the front desk that were absolutely garbage. they were incredibly rude. i was interested in purchasing a membership so they had me wait in the ""lobby"" but they wouldn't even let me use their restroom unless i was an official member. i would rather lose my weight on a treadmill than be here."
5-star,1,"great gym. they offer classes and are currently expanding this location which is awesome. they are family owned and the owners are always there and available if you have and questions, comments, concerns, and even advise! also there is a wide range of different people so no need to feel like this gym won't accept you, everyone starts somewhere."
5-star,1,this gym is so amazing! the staff is so friendly and the gym is so clean! i love that the machines are always accessible and that i don't feel that i'm at a dating club when i am working out. the crowd there is there to work out and not there to sit around a socialize. the kids care is amazing and that is a huge deal to me because it's hard to find people i trust to watch my son. i love working out knowing that he is well taken care of. the owners of the gym truly know what they are doing and are so friendly. i live in peoria and everytime i am out in surprise i stop by and work out here. i wish i lived closer i would come here all the time. this is saying a lot because working out for me has always been a chore. keep up the good work wtf!
5-star,1,"i don't even know where to start. they always have a smile, and take time to get to know you. zach is more than helpful with the machines, he never seems put out by little requests. and anne is always a pleasure to talk to. my kids love going to the child care area. one thing i was worried about was that because it is a smaller gym the machines would be older, totally not the case. i have never seen any of them broken. the gym is very clean and well maintained. if you are considering joining a gym in the west valley to me there is no other option! friendly staff, nice machines, child care, and clean!"
5-star,1,"hi my name is ricardo vasquez and i created the yelp page for ""westside total fitness "" .i am a members who is interested in putting a review.i am not paid and enjoy using yelp for honest reviews..i encourage other members to be honest about it.i gave it 5 stars because they deserved it.i believe this business should be allowed for recognition to any new potential members coming in.staff always friendly and welcoming you in.this gym is really nice,clean, sanitize and everything is wipe down.the air conditioning nice plus they have fans on the ceilings.the lighting is great and peaceful.just visit and one of the staff with be glad to give you a tour.nothing but weight to loose and a healthy lifestyle to gain.those of you looking to replace an existing gym, just might replace your gym and choose (wtf) like i did.thanks "" westside total fitness"" for opening this gym as my motor vehicle spine injury required me to do gym daily for the rest of my life."
1-star,0,"all the equipment is in need of repair. most machines have rips in their cloth or leather, along with pins missing that allow you to set the weight. the contract also apparently has an substantial early termination fee, that is hidden quite well. i cannot recommend this gym to anyone."
1-star,0,this gym is a complete joke! the wifi has been down since the new owner took over 6 months ago. i doubt it will ever be back up! the ac is more than likely broken because on some days it's hotter in there than it is outside. the biggest problem is that on sundays it does not open until 12 pm! the equipment is old. broken equipment is not repaired or replaced its just removed from the facility. the daycare hours are inconsistent. sign up at your own risk.
5-star,1,awesome gym with huge renovations and improvements being done. management is fantastic and is very interpersonal. the people here are warm and welcoming; the perfect gym for me and my wife.
1-star,0,"this place has a new owner this year. as of july 15th 2017 there is no ac. it's gotta be around 90 degrees inside there in the afternoon. it is very very hott! about 10% of the weights have been stolen. hopefully you don't need any 20lb dumbells or 40 lbs fixed barbells because they haven't been there for 3 or 4 months. the drinking fountain has been warm for a year. there used to be about 8 squat racks, now there is only 1! and the gym is huge. there is no chair sit on when using dumbells. all of the material on all of the benches are torn and ripped to shreds. the floor is bowing up in the middle of the gym and i trip on it all the time. the new owner said that he will not put a dime into the gym until people start respecting it. he has been there 6 months and it's going downhill fast. it used to be an amazing huge gym with so much equipment. now it's all broken, stolen and unkept. the gym opens at 12 pm on sundays so hopefully you don't like to workout in the morning on weekends. members are dropping like flies. this gym is next to my house and used to be 24 hours. now that the hours are limited and the gym is going downhill so fast i think i need to change gyms. really disappointing as this was my favorite gym in the area and i've been to a lot of gyms"
1-star,0,"this place is a law suit waiting to happen, if the patrons could ever afford a lawyer. knowing how many lawyers exist in cleveland and ohio generally, this place is a sitting duck."
5-star,1,"i find yoga to be very relaxing but challenging at the same time! yoga to the people did not disappoint from the moment i walked in the teacher was welcoming and studio looked inviting! i found spot and unrolled my mat, i arrived 15 ahead so i had plenty of time to find my spot! the studio is one big open room with two restrooms inside. the studio is donation base with suggestion of 10 bucks but no intention of turning you away if you do not have it this time. they invite you pay at end of class and come in to enjoy the practice first. i simply left my cash in basket on my way out. i love this system. the yoga practice was slow moving then gradually worked up to fast pace flow. i was sweating by end of class, don't forget to bring a towel if you need it. i also received hands on adjust which was nice for beginner such as myself. i have lived in tempe for almost two years now and just found this gem.. i will be back! tip.. the parking garage next door give 1 hour free parking and 1.50 after the first hour prior to 8pm i believe. check the studio website"
5-star,1,"i was staying nearby for business in the residence inn, and decided to check this studio out. the instructor was lovely, there was no chanting, and the studio was clean with plenty of room. really positive experience."
5-star,1,"this place is special. i've been doing yoga over 20 yrs and never cried at the end of my practice before. i love the way they allow you to just be. i like the diversity of people... it's not super yuppie and i like that. it embraces the true spirit and allows you to reach a meditative state easily. wish they had mediation only classes as i would like to bring friends who are afraid for one reason or another of the ""stretching"" poses."
5-star,1,"this studio is my life saver. after numerous illnesses that left me quite out of shape as well as in a very low tax bracket i was looking into feeling well and strong again. i felt defeated after checking into classes at other studios and realizing i wouldn't be able to afford restarting my yoga practice. that is until i found yttp! i love the classes and instructors and they make it clear they don't expect you to pay any more than you can afford. thank you, thank you, thank you!"
4-star,1,"this is a nice studio. a little hard to hear the instructor sometimes. also, the instructor barked at me to take my shoes off as i entered, which didn't exactly set the yoga vibe. i would return and take it with someone else! also, if you go to a late class, get your parking validated!"
5-star,1,this yoga studio is my new favorite! the instructors are very nice and accommodating to all types of people. if you haven't done yoga before they are very good at helping and showing how to modify the poses. they have free may storage as well if you want to leave your mat there. the parking garage is very convenient. i usually go on weekends or in the evening so parking is free.
5-star,1,love the donation-based model of this studio. dropped in while in az for work. class was challenging but also suitable for beginners. highly recommend!
5-star,1,"i've been to this yoga studio twice and it's really comfortable. the class is challenging and you will leave drenched in sweat but it's nothing a beginner couldn't do. i, myself, am a beginner. they recognize that not everyone has been practicing for years so you are encouraged to make modifications to suit your body's abilities. you never feel like you need to go past your limits. i plan to visit one of the candle lit classes on sunday nights. the music they place isn't the most soothing music but i tend to block it out and focus on the instructors voice. lastly, it's quite nice that they are donation based. i'm a grad student so you can imagine, i don't have a whole lot of spare money to spend on luxuries like are packages at yoga studios."
5-star,1,"i've had constant back problems and i wanted to try yoga classes. i've taken a few before through rec centers and mcc, etc. but being a starving artist and single mom, all the studios i looked at were extremely expensive and i found this so disappointing. i had no idea about yttp until i found it through a meetup group. i've been going there regularly now and i give as much as i can when i go. my back problems have improved and i am so thankful for this studio. i recommend it to everyone. only thing i wish they would have a little more variation of poses. its usually close to the same routine every time. this leaves me wanting to seek out other studios for more advanced moves. (if i can ever afford them). in the meantime, i'll keep coming here because yoga should belong to everyone! thank you yttp!"
5-star,1,"since i've only been to 2 or 3 yoga classes ever, i would not call myself a yoga enthusiast. but this place was great and i will certainly be back."
5-star,1,"this place is awesome! when i got to phoenix for my summer internship i was a little stunned at how expensive drop-in yoga classes are in comparison to my studio in tucson ($5 yoga oasis :) ) but this place is only a tad more expensive than my usual 5 spot ($10 per class suggested) - and i've gotten my money's worth every time! the teachers are great and the classes are tough! also, if you are worried about parking on asu campus, the parking structure right next to the studio is free after 6pm!"
5-star,1,"i love yoga to the people! i've lived in tempe for 6 years now, have tried so many yoga studios and really never found one that i liked-- until yttp came! the best thing about it is that it's donation-based yoga, so you give what you can (recommended $10 a class) but you always feel welcome and never judged, no matter how much (or little) you put in the donation box. the instructors are great and make you feel comfortable right away, even if it's your first yoga class ever. they work with you improve your poses, but also give you enough space to explore and enjoy your practice on your own. i've been going to cj's class recently and she's amazing! i can already feel the difference in my poses from the adjustments and pointers that she has given. the classes are flow classes and the instructors always give pose suggestions if you want to push yourself further, so you are able to get as hard of a workout as you want. if you haven't already, definitely give yttp a try, you seriously won't regret it."
5-star,1,"a little yoga gem right in the heart of college town. i've done yoga at a number of places & i'm used to expecting to ""get what you pay for"" so my expectations for my first donation based class weren't exactly high, but this place left me pleasantly surprised. it's perfectly clean, the ambiance is serene (esp during evening candlelit class), the staff is very personable, & of course, the yoga is awesome. i know it's a good class when my glasses fog up, which was achieved in every class i've taken with cindy & james. i've brought friends with me with all different yoga experience (even first timers) & they all loved it too. it's definitely a place worth trying & spreading the word about."
5-star,1,"yoga to the people is a great studio. i moved here recently from the northeast and was looking for a studio that matched the intensity and tranquility that i had in my studio in boston. yttp is all of that and more! cindy is a wonderful teacher and always gives a good mixture of flow, challenge, sweat and sweet peaceful shavasana at the end. the other rotating teachers all offer their own perspective and relationship to the practice. sunday candlelight flow classes and usually the most popular and why not? it is a perfect way to round out your weekend. you won't be disappointed."
5-star,1,"had been riding my bike past this place multiple times thinking, ""yoga studio = $$$$"" but to my delight (and prob yours) it's the exact opposite. i've done yoga across the valley (amateur yoga student for sure) but this was the hands down, absolute best yoga class i've been to. cindy is great and and whether it's a huge, filled class or a small post-work class of just 5 she makes sure you're doing the positions accurate and at your level. i think it's great for the community, for your mind and for your body. i know i sound super granola-ie but it's a great team and they've helped me become confidant and passionate about the practice. the whole donation based thing is also great, they're never pushy or awkward about the tissue box which was an immediate concern for me. go. just go. you won't regret it, you'll just be hooked!"
5-star,1,"over the past two months i have been consistently attending classes at yttp, and i am so glad that i make time for yoga. they rotate teachers, but every teacher has been helpful and understanding, while adding their own flavor of their yoga practice. every class i learn how to improve my practice and i feel more relaxed every time i walk out the door. overall, i think that it is an excellent class, especially for being donation based."
5-star,1,"i have never done yoga in my life, but was completely welcomed by the instructor and fellow students! because this first time, i have no idea whether or not it was good by comparison to other classes, but i had a very fun time. it was much more strenuous and soothing than i could even imagine and i felt it was a steal for $12. that said, the yoga is free (suggested 10 dollar donation) and welcomes all levels of flexibility an experience. there is also a $2 rental fee for the yoga mat, but you can also bring your own. if you live in and around tempe, yoga and this place are worth a try. i hope to see you there soon!"
5-star,1,"when i came to tempe for graduate school two years ago, one of the things i was saddest to leave behind in tucson was the wonderful $4 yoga hour at yoga oasis. i looked for a place to practice once i arrived, but i couldn't afford most studios on a graduate stipend, and i didn't like practicing at the rec center (ever tried to do happy baby in front of a bunch of frat boys?). so i stopped practicing. no longer! i went to class at yoga to the people today and couldn't have been more pleased with my experience. the space was clean and peaceful, our instructor led us through a mindful practice with suggestions on how to make the poses easier or more challenging depending on experience. it felt very supportive and non-judgmental, even though i was one of only four (!) students there. what i like best is that they are donations based. having felt like i had been priced out of studio practice, which is the best way for me to commit to yoga, i am so grateful that yttp has come to tempe. for now, i am just going to enjoy it until it gets crowded! and probably after that, too."
5-star,1,this is my favorite location out of all of them!! the staff is really chill and that is what keeps us coming. some of the other locations have the trainers that are rude and try acting all rough. definitely recommend this location to youfit members or anyone near by looking for a membership.
1-star,0,"i've been dealing with this youfit location and their corporate office for a month now to cancel the membership. after going into the location and paying the cancellation call, we've received calls roughly every other day from the billing department demanding additional cancellation fees. the representatives have been harassing. the cancelation was due to a family tragedy and no empathy has been offered. i've been told to call the independent location which i've done 5 times now with no resolution and no call back. the customer service of this company has been unacceptable and disappointing to say the least."
5-star,1,"i have taken the time to get to know the people who work here before i joined, and they truly care about people. i have been going daily (except sunday, that's church day) and i am very happy with you fit and their employees, all you need to do is ask and they will help. a gym is your dedication and spirit you make it what it is."
4-star,1,"i like this place cause it's nice and calm, not to packed when i go. the only downer is there is no steam rooms or pools to relax. other than that it's pretty good has everything i need to work out. the people that go there seem to go to work out not stare at people so that's good!!!"
1-star,0,"i am so absolutely frustrated and dissapointed in the service i have recieved on behalf of my mother that i feel the need to express myself on every public outlet for others to see and be warned. i signed up for the membership for my mother who is battling with health issues that desperately require her to exercise to ease her pain. i told the rep that i would be responsible for paying the monthly membership fee and that she could pay for any additional services she wanted. my mother signed up for a personal trainer and was to pay $90 every two weeks. well the 1st time they charged her over $100 and within 2 weeks following that, she paid an additional $180 and just 2 days later they charged my account for $90 which overdrew my account and caused my bank to charge me a $35 overdraft fee that was not returned. i was left unable to purchase gas to get to work and all i received was a ""it's not my fault, its how our billing is set up"" and an apology that really meant nothing. almost a week later $90 was refunded to my account which really wasnt $90 because i was still charged the overdraft fee from my bank. then today, my mother went in and was told she owed $180 dollars not even one week later!!!!not only did it stress my mother, but it embarrassed her to the point where she no longer wants to go to that gym. i called and spoke with the rep who signed us up and he didn't care at all. i spoke with the general manager there and she was frustrated but also said she would contact my mother to assure her it would be taken care of yet didn't call her. ""i'm sorry"" isn't enough. its a clean, inexpensive gym, but the customer service sucks, and at this point i don't feel that our business is valued or welcomed and i don't recommend this type of treatment to anyone."
5-star,1,"since my last review i've had nothing but smiles and friendly greetings upon arrival. thanks to the gregory and the youfit staff for taking my concern, albeit small, seriously. now, this is the perfect gym for me. :)"
4-star,1,i've been going here for 4 months now. this is the first gym i've ever been in. everything is always clean and the employees pleasant. most of the time i go in about 4am so my perception may be tainted by how quiet it is but there is a regular morning crowd and we all nod as we go in and out. i joined mostly to do cardio in a temperature regulated environment and that is working out much better than walking around the block for me. sometimes i will use the circuit of machines. one time they failed to open and one time there was almost a whole row of broken machines but neither has turned into a regular problem.
1-star,0,"have you seen their commercial tagline ""no ball and chain, no pressure"" hhaa! i signed up for youfit seven months ago, paid a $10 monthly fee plus $30 annual fee. i asked them months ago to please cancel my membership as i had moved out of the area. i never once used this gym because i joined a better gym near me with better equipment that wasn't old and broken and cracked! they refused to cancel my membership until i paid a $10 ""processing"" fee. ""processing"" i presume means they tick an ""inactive"" button on my account that would take them 2 seconds. i even wrote them a letter months ago to cancel in addition to physically enter the gym to speak with someone. i was given such a hard time by the staff, they would not take my card or bank information off file and said my card would continually be charged the $10/mo. i finally had to put a stop payment through my bank, they are just thieves, i spent over $100 on a gym i never used because they wouldn't cancel my membership. i should have learned my lesson the first time with these crappy franchise gyms that suck you in with a low payment-no contract marketing scheme. i finally found a great gym that is not a franchise and is so much more professional and awesome. don't get ""ball and chained"" by handing over your bank info to these guys."
1-star,0,i joined the gym a year ago i got my own gym equipment so i went to cancel my membership a fee to cancel my membership come on really
5-star,1,great gym. great price. super clean. new equipment and staff are super friendly. i like the wide range of hours and all the drinks they have there.
5-star,1,"this is the cleanest gym i have ever been in. the staff are all friendly, things get put away, and there are plenty of machines and weights so you can get an excellent workout. the stretching area is a bit small and they don't have a complete set of smaller barbells or easy bars, but you can work around that. no frills-- just a nice, bright, clean gym. we've belonged to four different gyms now (they keep getting sold and/or closing), and we are really happy at youfit. the price is right too!"
1-star,0,"well ... if i had written this review 8 months ago, it would probably have been different. however, since joining this gym (i have recently cancelled) things have changed drastically. when i joined, they had specific hours in which they were open for business. mostly ok with that. however when planet fitness opened nearby, they revised their hours to 24/7 to complete. after only 1 month, they went back to only being open specific hours during each day. this is annoying. and recently their employees started power lifting, making grunting noises, and dropping large heavy weights, which scared the hell out of me every time they drop the weights!!! very annoying again! then the final straw ... they no longer provide wi-fi for their members. this is a huge thing for me, and a deal breaker. i'm done. the management has recently changed as well, and he was completely rude and was not the least bit sympathetic when i voiced my concerns. he really didn't care that i was having issues and about to cancel my membership. so ok then ... i joined planet fitness, 1 mile away, and love it there."
1-star,0,"i've never been to the gym, but still rating this based on the experience i had trying to even get information from them! after my frustrations, i can't foresee going there to work out. i've tried calling them twice, to find out about personal training costs. don't get me wrong, both times they were nice, but i have still not received any information from them, even after giving them my e-mail address twice. i called and spoke with a gentleman a couple of weeks ago, and he kept asking me questions, but didn't seem to register my answers. i guess he was reading from a script. i don't like it when you ask someone what they charge for a service (which i did) and their response is, ""well, what can you afford?"" or ""well what is your budget?"" instead of this translating to me that they're willing to negotiate a price, i get a used-car salesman feel of, ""we're willing to for you to pay much lower, but we won't tell you that. we'll find out what your max is, so we can push you as close to that dollar amount as possible."" i don't have a budget yet. i'm sorry... how about you give me some prices, and i'll figure out if i can afford it... the guy also asked when it was convenient for me to work out. i work during ""normal business hours,"" in fact later, so it would be late at night after my kids go to sleep, when someone else is at the house to be w/them, and i'm not an early riser/morning person, which i specifically told him. his response was, ""well, if you can be there at five a.m. a personal trainer can be there for you."" why ask me what my schedule is and when it would be convenient for me to work out, if you're going to tell me who is available when i'm not? i also had my weekend fully booked for my kids' activities, which i also told him multiple times, indicating i wasn't able to come in to talk to a manager, and that i would prefer they just e-mail me the information. then, w/out listening, he said, ""why don't you come in on saturday, or sunday, 9-2, when my manager is here, or come on monday 8-5 when my manager is here?"" um.... it's like i was talking to a wall b/c i had just said i wasn't available during those times! i'm not a ""lookie-loo"", but i'm not pulling teeth to get info. from them anymore and now have zero desire to go in and use their facility. if they're open 24/7, they should truly be available 24/7."
4-star,1,"not sure why this place gets bad reviews. this is by far the least aggravating gym i've ever been a member of. their rates are $10 a month. yes there is a $30 annual fee, but its still only $150 a year. i can't find rates like that anywhere in town. i like that it is no frills. there is no juice bar, massage clinic, spinning class, etc. i've seen some new gyms that look more like a singles bar than a gym. they have at least 2 of everything, tons of treadmills and elliptical machines, and the one time that the machines i wanted to use were all busy, i hopped on a treadmill for 15 minutes and the place had cleared out. also, unlike at other gyms i've gone to, the trainers don't come up and try to sell you on their services while you're trying to work out. i hated that at pure fitness. i don't love working out, but i don't hate it as much since i joined youfit."
1-star,0,i honestly am so disgusted with this place. the staff is unprofessional. 24 hour fitness is only maybe 10 dollars more a month with a better staff and better advisement of what you're actually signing a contract for. won't let me cancel and i haven't used the gym once in the two weeks i've had the membership. don't waste any money there.
1-star,0,"this is unbelievable! i was just charged a 30 dollar ""annual fee"" which i was never made aware of. i have had more issues with non-disclosure with this gym that i will be closing my membership. i would rather pay more every month at another gym than to deal with a company that lies and doesn't tell you up front about extra fees! this is outrageous."
4-star,1,"just signed up for this gym its 10 dollars a month, no pool or bball courts. but they have a lot of treadmills and ellipticals which are good so you will never have to wait. its been open for 6 months, the staff is very friendly and nice. david the manager told me about the place when it first opened. he is awesome and does a good job of keeping a good gym. there aren't any meatheads there which is good so people like me wont be intimidated.. haha very casual place to go work out just to stay in shape, not if you want to be mr. usa...or mrs..."
5-star,1,"i joined about 2 1/2 months ago and i love coming here!!! i've never liked working out, be it alone at a gym, in group personal training or with a one-on-one trainer. but classes at ilkb are not only a killer workout, but fun! i give full credit to the trainers - alli, ciara, clarissa, jesus, ace and tiffani. such amazing people who are so encouraging and supportive - helpful and motivating. and the other class members are so friendly, too. i've made several friends so far in my short time there and when you consider we are all sweaty puddles by the end of the class, it's like a family for sure! best workout i've ever had - full body - no muscle is safe!!! ilkb!!!!"
5-star,1,i love ilovekickboxing! i feel so good doing the workout and even better after a workout! the bonus is losing the twenty pounds i'm wanting to! the staff does an amazing and awesome job at encouraging and supporting you through it from start to finish and the staff knows you and treat you great! oh and the members here are just as supportive! these classes motivate me to come out and get into the habit of a daily fit routine that is fun from beginning to end! come out and have fun with all of us and let ilovekickboxing help you achieve your fitness goals!
5-star,1,i love coming to kickboxing i've already lost 5 lbs in the first 2 weeks everyone is so helpful and the instructors are amazing.
5-star,1,"ilkb ahwatukee is one of the most fun but challenging work out i have ever done. you can feel the results and see them. the instructors are very lively, personable, and they become your family. i would recommend them to everyone!! ilkb you knowww!!!!"
5-star,1,totally cool place. great people who workout at kickboxing and the instructors are amazing. i signed up for 5 classes and after the first day i signed up. naomi and kerri are so great to workout with because they work your butt off lol. if your looking for a great fun and amazing place to get a great workout come to ilkb.
5-star,1,ilovekickboxing is such a fun way to get in a quick yet effective workout everyday! classes are only and hour long which makes it easy to fit into your schedule. the instructors are lively and motivating and the facility is very well maintained. 100% recommend to those looking to reach their fitness goals!!
5-star,1,"a butt kicking, energizing, strength and stamina building workout. the instructors care about you and your goals. the owners are incredibly socially conscious people running a great company. this got me out of my fitness rut for sure!"
5-star,1,i love this place! the instructors are so friendly and helpful and keep you motivated throughout the entire workout! i recommend this place to anyone who wants a fun and rewarding experience!
5-star,1,where do i start? i don't even know when i joined but i have loved every minute of being a part of the ilkb family. i love the energy and the motivation i get from the instructors and the other members. i am on a track to lose weight and gain muscle so i can look stunning in my engagement photos and in my wedding dress a few months later. i am so glad that i was referred to ilkb. i have already seen a change in my energy and in my clothes becoming a little baggy. i never feel defeated when i leave and i am happy and excited to return the next day. i am so blessed to have an amazing gym family that knows my name when i walk in the door. this place is so much better than a regular gym. no machines. no pressure to compete. ilkb you know!!!!
5-star,1,"i am so excited to continue my journey with ilkb. i try to fit in my 3-4 classes a week, but when i don't, i refer to tips to do at home workouts that i have learned from instructors. also, when i run, i push myself even harder since i know that i did when i was at an ilkb class!"
5-star,1,"love love love these classes. i have only been in 5 classes and am already feeling different and noticing changes in my body and my performance. each class is fun. instructors are fantastic. everyone is very nice. the gym is kept very clean! highly recommend this as a great place for a full body, fun workout!"
5-star,1,awesome workout! you will rain sweat if you work hard. only kickboxing here not a typical gym which was fine with me! great deal right now for 5 classes & gloves!
5-star,1,love this place! i signed up after my first class! the workout is awesome and so is the staff. everyone is friendly and it's super clean.
1-star,0,"want to get lean? want to gain muscle? this is not the place to go. they only have bags,no weights,no bands, nada. i was seriously disappointed and it was a huge waste of money. sorry ilkb but you are a gym for new years resolutioners. you know the ones that go for a week and thats it."
2-star,0,"the instructors are amazing and the only reason i would ever go back but the owners were so rude to me and made me feel like all they wanted was my money. i had signed up for the seven months worth of classes but then had to back out because of financial reasons. the instructor completely understood and told me i would get my refund because i backed out within three days of signing up. then the owners i could tell were not happy with me having to back out. the man tried several times to get me to back out next time i came but i was persistent and finally got him to end it that night. he said my refund should come to me once it got processed through them first. so i waited a couple weeks then finally had to call. i talked to the other owner on the phone and she ended up telling me they don't give refunds, which i find hard to believe. i really would have loved to come back once i could afford it but now i'm definitely not."
5-star,1,i joined a couple of weeks ago and everytime i go workout i am greeted with open arms. the workout is awesome and the encouragement from the staff is fantastic! i highly recommend joining.
5-star,1,ilovekickboxing.com has been an amazing new experience for me. their staff is so friendly and welcome you in where you feel like family day one! it's a workout i look forward to on a daily basis that kicks my butt and leaves me feeling great and energized! i highly recommend adding ilkb into your weekly routine!
5-star,1,"ilovekickboxing changed my life and become a major part of it. the staff are so awesome and motivating. it truly is a family that supports you. and boy do you sweat, they kick your butt in a good way! it's honestly the highlight of my day and has become addicting. can't recommend it enough!!"
5-star,1,"this place is awesome. instructors : rachel, chachi and daniel are so helpful and fun to be with. intense workout.. but i so love it!! no pain no gain. i've gained more self confidence, more energy and just a whole different person since i signed up.. and guess what!! i signed up for the rest of the year.. yeah to #ilovekickboxing!!"
1-star,0,"tried quad for the first time. for the record, i cycle and swim regularly. however, 3/4 of the way into the class, there was literally a lack of oxygen in the room. the basement with poor ventilation situation with no windows open is extremely unsafe. add 50+ people overexerting. it was hot, humid, lacked any ventilation or fresh air. i started feeling light-headed, and not from the workout. i took my oxygen saturation reading immediately after leaving class (i happen to work in this field and had a diagnostic device on me at the time) and verified that i was actually hypoxic. stop cramming so many people and bikes into the room, crack open a window/figure out ventilation before one of your patrons passes out and sues you."
4-star,1,"i really want to love this place. it's a convenient location. i love the underground feel. checking in is super straightforward, as are the changing rooms. i've been for two classes now and the workout has been something i'm feeling the next day. but! i am a bit floored by the two instructors i experienced. they were both male and both employed full-on screamo band voices when counting down, or saying, ""let's go!!!!!!!!!!!!"". guttural. downright frightening. someone else's vibe perhaps, but not mine. i was spinning away, but looking around like, ""am i the only person hearing this absolute goul voice?"". to each their own. i will definitely be returning, but i think it's still a matter of finding my perfect instructor."
4-star,1,"i have taken spinning before, so this was not my first time. but the instructor was good, and the class was challenging. i went during lunch time on a weekday, so it was not crowded at all. i agree with other reviewers that it can seem cramped down in the basement, but since there weren't too many others taking class, i did not feel uncomfortable. would go again."
2-star,0,"i have gone to many spin studios across the city over the years and this might be my least favourite. the king location is dark and smelly and damp (being a basement and all) but the leslieville location is nice. the bikes are poorly maintained. the place is often crowded. the change room at the king location is cramped and people are always putting their bags on the benches so there is nowhere to sit (the benches are for asses, not bags, people!). my main complaint though is that the instructors are not good. as a fitness buff and someone who appreciates getting taught by people who know more about proper training, fitness and exercise physiology than i do (isn't that what i am paying for - their expertise and guidance?), the quad instructors do not fit the bill. all of the ones i have had just pound it out on the bike, having you jump up and down in your seat and there seems to be little method to their madness. i guess it makes it ""fun"" and ""energetic"" for people, which is fine if that is all you are looking for. i am looking for a good workout though that has exercise science to back it up, and so that i am getting the most out of my time. i don't feel that i get this here. if others are looking for the same kind of workout as i am, i highly recommend the nearby cykl. the instructors there are actually competitive/sport cyclists themselves and/or know the science behind the exercise. this is evident through how they guide you through intervals at key moments, hill rides at key moments, active recovery phases, anaerobic vs. aerobic threshold, etc.. they also explain their workout to you in advance so you know what to expect (the quad instructors i have had never do this). i appreciate the enthusiasm of quad instructors, but enthusiasm for spinning is not enough. you can tell when you read the bios on the quad website as well - most do not have training or sport backgrounds (although some do). many seemed to have come to it because they went to classes and liked it, so decided to teach. it would be more helpful if they understood proper exercise training better and developed their workouts in that way. that is a large part of what i expect in a fitness instructor. also, i do spin primarily for the cardio workout, but i find i don't get that here in an effective way (due to the lack of knowledge of the intructors on things like proper interval training, which is by far the most effective way to develop your cardio fitness). if you are just looking for energy, loud music and more of a dance club vibe, and a place to just peddle and jump up and down to your heart's content, then this might be your kind of place.. but if you are looking for a more serious exercise routine (and by serious, i don't mean not fun!) where the instructor knows how to guide you through a proper workout that is based on the latest exercise science and real training techniques, then this place might not be for you."
2-star,0,have to say it's kinda cool going downstairs into this spin studio dungeon. unfortunately i did not enjoy the bikes they are rather old and the sound system is awful but from where i was on the left of the instructor i could not hear their voice as the bass was too boom boom. also does not help when the main speakers are behind the audience.
2-star,0,"i'm torn between giving this place 5 stars (for the instructors) and 0 stars for the facilities and patrons. i purchased a 2 week unlimited pass over the holidays and went more than half a dozen times. let me start with the positives. instructors: one word - amazing! i've been spinning for years and the instructors here give me a run for my money. they are high energy, effective, and intense. it felt like classes taught by aggressive downtown bike couriers on steroids. that's everything nice i have to say about quad. now on to the negatives. bikes: one word - dilapidated. holy shit i don't think i saw a single bike in there that wasn't rusty. if you show up wearing runners instead of spinning shoes, good luck. all their foot straps are faulty. the bikes are old and poorly maintained and none of them have a watt meter. i tried four different bikes and the brakes on some of them are so hard that turning the knob by more than 2 centimeters renders it unmovable. facilities: unacceptable at best. tiny change rooms that cannot possibly accommodate the 30-60 women they attempt to cram into a dark and dank basement. ventilation is extremely poor and there is no room to stretch before and after each class because your neighbor is practically sitting on your bike seat. it's like bikram spinning on a crowded train in mumbai. reception: they don't even have a key card scanner so anyone who shows up has to present their membership card to the receptionist who manually enters names into a log book. at one point i've seen 20 people queue up to check in. really? i didn't realize i stepped into a basement and got transported to 1973. patrons: oddly competitive and bitchy. during the 50 minute session you'll have women clad in head to toe lululemon attire (regardless of age) staring at or giving other spinners the side eye. it got so bad that during one class the instructor reiterated at least 8-10 times that we are not competing with each other and that we should focus on our own efforts, nobody cares if you're the fastest spinner in here etc. these bitches need to calm the fuck down. if you're so good at cycling your ass would be competing in the tour de france and not sardined in a clammy and odorous basement in toronto. again it was a tremendous workout despite the shitty equipment, shitty people and ineffective front desk."
5-star,1,"i was browsing some exercise that makes me repeat my visits to work out and a girlfriend talked to me about this place and we started going together. i was amazed with the energy in the air, the loud and vibrant music and the staff. the studio i enjoy the most is the queen east one. i am not a fan of the king west one. it's dark and old. the changing room is not comfortable, a totally contrary experience is queen east. a clearer location with 2 changing rooms (1 at the main level and other in the second level). classes price are within market price range, not cheaper not more expensive. this new year before committing myself with a 3 or 6 months membership i am going to explore other spinning studios. i hope to update my review when i finish my expedition!"
4-star,1,"anyone who wants to cycle, i recommend to definitely try quad. quad was initially very intimidating for me as i was a beginner and i didn't know what to expect, but after the first class i was hooked! everyone is really friendly and the energy you feel while riding is amazing! all instructors are great, that always switch things up and play a wide selection of music! from past experience, i advise to sign up for classes ahead of time online and get their early to change/grab a bike as it can get pretty packed."
4-star,1,"dark, damp and loud. perfect. love this spot for spinning classes. everyone is really friendly and it feels like an underground dance party when you're riding. i like the changerooms and this place just has a good feel to it. i will definitely be back for more classes."
5-star,1,"quad is a wonderful place to exercise. i have been going for the past 6 months and i have never looked back. the instructors are friendly, the space at both quad and quad east are beautiful and the bikes are in good condition. i can truly say quad turned my fitness routine around and i feel that i am in the best shape i have ever been. they are great with beginners and will take time to set you up on the bike. go try it out!"
5-star,1,"fantastic spin place! i'm back in toronto temporarily and took a intro class and went back again today, this place is just great. everyone has been so friendly, welcoming and most importantly encouraging. i've only experienced two classes and both were fantastic instructors who knew how to play current and updated music. most of the spin classes i've attended in the past are a bit, well - meh. quad was super, by far the best spin class i've ever been to. the only downfall is i have to go back to vancouver and there is no place like this. anyone who wants to cycle should definitely try quad."
5-star,1,i started at quad in january and i have enjoyed my experience. the change rooms are small and ventilation could be a bit better but i will continue to go and renew my membership. i did alot of hunting before signing up for membership at a spin studio. the instructors are positive and generally have a great energy. when i first started i was a complete novice and the instructor helped get me set up. she would also check in after a few weeks to see if the configuration was still good and notice if i made tweaks along the way. i will say that quinton's 1 hour endurance class is by far the best reason to keep going back. if you like pushing yourself check that one out. it' s not cheap but i get alot of value out of it.
4-star,1,"i'm taking an 8-week class at quad right now and i'm two weeks in and loving it. as other reviewers are saying, it's a bit cramped, but really, you're intended to be on your bike for the duration of class so once you're on, it's not a big problem. packed classes just mean more sweating and isn't that the point? the instructors are fantastic, funny, and motivating. music is selected to be motivating too and cranked which just makes me want to go faster!! they've got a disco ball and coloured lights set up too to keep you pumped about being there. we did abs after our last class and that's when the cramped space becomes more of an issue, but we made it work... and it still hurts to laugh so i know it was worth staying for."
4-star,1,"great for in the winter when i'm not riding my real bike. i loved matt's sunday am class but i haven't been back since he's left. i plan to return in the fall though. i always feel like i get a great workout. i agree with the other reviewer though....it can feel a little squishy when full and boy does it get hot, hot, hot!"
