Star Rating,Nature of Rating,Review Comment
1-star,0,"stood in line like an idiot for 5 minutes to purchase 2 pants and was ignored by 2 cashier's (one was doing inventory on a paper or something and the other unboxing somethings). probably because how i was dressed and my skin color, i like being very comfortable on my days off. i throw my things on the counter and walked out. i will gladly take my money else where."
4-star,1,another great store with quality equipment. the staff is super friendly and helpful and was able to help me find what i was looking for quickly
5-star,1,"the problem with this store is not that they have awesome customer service. it's not that their entire staff is absolutely friendly. it's not that their inventory is amazing, it's that i can never choose just one thing so i end up buying what i need and then just come back to buy what i want. it happens to me all the time i go there! i'm the, ""just take my money,"" guy when i'm there. see what i did there [insert devilish smile]... but seriously, i mean every word of awesomeness that i said. i'm already a huge and loyal fan of 5.11 products but it's the overall customer service and experience the staff provides and believe me, from the moment you walk in until the moment you walk out, without fail, you will be greeted, welcomed, asked if you have any questions, reminded that someone's always there for you, assisted, and overall satisfied and confident knowing that the experience will never change every time you visit and shop at their store. you can tell that 5.11 seriously cares about their patrons and customers by selecting the best employees to staff and represent their company! way to go 5.11! you guys are awesome!"
5-star,1,great place! we went in at almost closing time and we didn't feel rushed to purchase. the employees were knowledgeable and friendly.
5-star,1,"love this shop. the employees are incredibly friendly and patient with all o our questions. there's a large selection of men's and women's clothing. it's great to be able to try things on before purchasing, even though the 5.11 catalog is extensive, it's sometimes hard to tell how some things will fit. my wallet is always a bit lighter whenever i leave the shop."
3-star,0,"i'm with others' who tried to exchange something and were not able to. i spent nearly $600 on three pair of pants, three shirts and two belts. the pants that i bought had an expandable waistband which i did not see before getting them home. they didn't fit right from the start, then i noticed the waistband. i can't stand expandable waistbands. i'll take them to a tailor/seamstress and get them altered. they are very nice but when you spend that kind of money out of your own pocket and have a problem, you should be able to exchange them. the manager i spoke with was very professional and i could see he sympathized with me but there was nothing he could do. he did say they were having a big sale after thanksgiving and yes! i'm going to see what they have. rick c. be safe firearms instruction las vegas, nv."
5-star,1,"have bought 5.11 tactical shirts and pants on line and have been very satisfied. while in las vegas, my wife and i needed waterproof jackets to go whitewater rafting in the grand canyon. they had a great selection of everything including the jackets and we were quite pleased. staff was very helpful and knowledgeable. nice quality as expected an i was bone dry. although i will continue to by online, i will shop here every time i come to vegas."
5-star,1,everyone here is very nice and patient and when there is a sale they recommend the sale rack and recommend new items and free promotions !
5-star,1,"i've bought products from this store online as well as at bass pro shops so you can imagine how happy i was when their own retail store opened up two years ago. located off dean martin drive and the interstate 15 between flamingo and tropicana, the store is on a relatively central location off the strip. all the retail staff are knowledgeable and you can tell they believe in the high quality products they sell. they have clean fitting rooms as well as a wide selection of women's and men's apparel as well as tactical accessories. keep a lookout for deals as i took advantage of their discounts during father's day weekend and other events. i like how this location now not only carries yeti products but also has carries the high quality coffee brand that is made by military veterans. i literally walk into this store twice a year and spend a couple hundred dollars and am more than satisfied."
5-star,1,"we had an awesome experience here. karlie and nessa (vanessa) helped us a ton. we came in with a list and they knew exactly what he needed. vanessa grabbed pants for him to try on and by the time he knew what size he needed, karlie had already pulled everything else we needed from the shelves and was ready to ring us up. they had a few items that weren't in stock, but karlie ordered them and we'll be able to pick them up as soon as they come in. she packed all of his items into the bag we purchased to make it easier to carry. she went above and beyond customer service by casually chatting with us while we browsed, sharing advice, and even telling me how to wash the pants we purchased. this was an awesome experience-we will definitely be back!"
5-star,1,the store is always clean and organized and the team is on it. thanks again karlie for all the product knowledge and help!
5-star,1,"took advantage of their awesome fathers day sale last week and spent a bit to get a lot of good deals! the staff were very helpful! one thing i can say is ""i'll be back!"". if i could make a suggestion, it would be to have a few shopping carts for tactical gear junkies like myself. i had to clutter their countertop with all of the items i was purchasing that were on sale. i think i actually used up all of their shopping bags on my purchase. thank you, las vegas' 5.11 tactical store staff!"
5-star,1,"karlie and caitlin are awesome, every time we come in they are extremely knowledgeable and courteous. great to deal with and we always leave happy"
1-star,0,"i attempted to exchange my comically oversized shirt and wasn't able to since it had been washed. if you have expensive merchandise in a poor location, you'd better damn well have excellent customer service if you hope to keep a loyal clientele. good luck with that."
5-star,1,"i was in need of a 1.5 inch tactical belt. i don't remember the girl that helped me but she suggested i size up. thank god i did, the belt is perfect. i got the 511 trainer belt. service was excellent. i will be back for a qalo ring, and a new backpack soon. thank you 511 tactical!"
5-star,1,awesome customer service everyone of their employees went out of their way to make sure we had no questions and found everything we were looking for. the merchandise is killer. can't beat their prices. very clean and and well organized.
4-star,1,"although i have yet to meet gage for myself, my husband particularly likes working with him to find what he needs and what other range employees need when he comes here. usually john is never adamant about that kind of thing, but because he has mentioned it, i know this guy must be great. i came here the other day to look for some shoes i had seen online. unfortunately, they didn't have it. however, i know i can order them from the store. sweet. i ended up swooping a pair of pants though. i appreciate that they have a changing room, too. this isn't a dig on the store itself because it's not their fault, but some of the women's 5.11 products are pretty lame. why don't they make anything in multicam or od green for women? the shirt graphics are also a little corny. maybe i'm just not tacticool enough or something. but they do have their ccw bags and a full length mirror you can check yourself out in to see how you like it. this last trip up, customer service was great from the guy. the female was standoffish and definitely wasn't as nice to me as a few of the other ladies that walked in before me. she was happy to mention discounts and sales going on to them, but not to me. oh well. i'll remember that next time and ask someone else for help if i need it."
5-star,1,"great selection, yes the prices are high but they mainly only sell 5.11 products which from my experience are of the highest quality. i had a issue with water getting into the leather on a tactical boot that i bought there they replaced it with out any issue. staff is knowledgeable and attentive. only problem is i can't get everything i want when i'm in there."
1-star,0,"this place has all sorts of 5.11 goodies. unfortunately,they have some serious issues when it comes to customer service. i picked out a number of items and went to the counter to get rung up. not a lot of stuff, less than $100.00. for some reason, the cashier asks for my name, 'for the receipt'. fine, i give it. they ring the items up, and i prepare to swipe a visa vanilla cash card, one of the ones you get with no customer name on it. the cashier says 'before you swipe, i need an i.d. well this is something i have never had asked when using these cards. there is no need for these guys to see your i.d. i decline to show, mostly because it is outside in the car. cashier says' i need to see an i.d.' at this point, i have had enough. i guess they do enough business to turn people away, and i am very suspicious of what they are going to do with my personal information. so i tell them to get a clue, and walk out of the store. so all in all, don't bother, just use the internet."
5-star,1,the staff is really nice and the clothes are great quality. they didnt have any sales though so your gonna be paying alot of money.
5-star,1,"the customer service is amazing here. i literally downloaded this app because of the compassion towards there customers. i came in needing some new work pants. not only were they more then willing to help, but they were extremely knowledgeable on there product. what really got me was i had recently just purchase a pare of pants from them several months ago. they were made 3 months old an the inseam of the pants. long story short they took care of the issue. mind you there not cheap product, but they have the best product an they stand by there name. if u ever happen to come in make sure you speak to austin, gage, karlie. they are marvelous."
5-star,1,i've purchased pants online from 5.11 and i really love them. i didn't know they had a store here in town. went to check it out. they have a pretty big selection and all sizes including long inseams on pants. i mostly looked at the women's stuff. i was liked for gym shoes but didn't find what i was interested in from their online store. no worries though. when i need pants it will be nice to be able to try them on before buying. the employees were super nice. i was created right away and they were helpful. i ended up only buying a hat since i mostly just came down to check the place out as something interesting to do...but it's a kick ass hat haha. i'm be back for the pants later.
5-star,1,"great selection of high quality merchandise for outdoor activities such as camping, hiking, and exploring. their outdoor clothing and backpack selection was exceptional along with a nice military grade boot inventory. the staff is absolutely fantastic, very personable, polite, and helpful. i would absolutely recommend this place for your outdoor activity needs. enjoyed the experience at 5.11 tactical."
5-star,1,"i showed up a bit before noon on saturday 9/17. i didn't expect to get any help as i figured that would be a busy time of day. anyways, i had absolutely no intention of getting anything. i just needed to figure out the correct size i needed in a pair of their pants. (work was going to buy them). well, the staff was beyond helpful. i decided to look around and got a few things because of how great they were. you can tell that the crew working that day liked each other and their job. i'll be back. i wish customer service was always this good."
4-star,1,"great place. all the employees were friendly and eager to help. the prices were very low compared to calvada or american shooters. the only thing was i wished they had more of a women's selection for tops, but what can you do."
2-star,0,"not a bad place if you like 5:11 511 or 5:11 lol they definitely have a decent selection of commonly needed items and offer knowledgeable service on the carried product but because it is a corporate store and corporately trained . what is lacking is the customer service and attention to detail that you get from a mom and pop shop so if you like all the flash look coolness....go here.. to me the service is better at other supply houses that also offer you other brands of non clothing items so it can be a one stop shop with complete service for all your needs instead of running all over town 4 common items that you need . it appears that they are trying to open all their own stores to pigeonhole out the little guy from carrying their product. it comes across as pure greed!! to be honest the last two pair of shoes / duty boots i purchased fell apart extremely quickly if the quality of the product keeps going down and they seem to just want more money ....proper seems to be making a better product these days, and that might be the route we will have to go .this does tend to cater more to the civilian market who like to look operatorish . lol they did not even have patches that were not made by 5:11 it is the equivalent of going to a 511 walmart i hope they care enough to take note"
5-star,1,"this store has every single piece of 5.11 gear and a bit more. friendly people and pretty good prices, 5.11 prices are the same everywhere you go. they also had specific 5.11 las vegas tee shirts too. very cool!"
5-star,1,"this store is awesome has everything you want and more for both gals and guys!! the quality of their merchandise is amazing, the customer service is out of this world and the employees are always so nice and so knowledgeable!! perfect place to get the perfect gift no place like it!!"
1-star,0,lots of people standing around talking about what they did last night. not one person asked if we needed help at any point in our 30 minute visit. why so many employees? are they strictly cashiers and not supposed to greet and help out customers. lame
1-star,0,i have tried to skate this place several times but it's always closed. it would be nice if they were open for people who skate on the weekends.
5-star,1,"i had skate here many times and everyone is so friendly and the park is really good. the staff will offer to help you out for free some times and i gotta say, i learned a lot from those quick lessons. if you don't have a board you can rent one for super cheap and the admission is also really cheap. i will continue to come back here and skate i love this park!"
2-star,0,there is no structure to their lessons. a lesson could have one kids or six. many times the teacher gives little to no attention to your child. we tried to talk to the owner and left voicemails and wrote emails...no answer.
5-star,1,great skate park for the whole family. great people. staff is amazing. thank you for making such a great environment.
5-star,1,"great facility run by awesome people. my son never touched a skateboard before this week and within 30 minutes he was dropping in. he's a good athlete so all results won't be the same but the teacher is good, knows his stuff and loves what he does. if you got a kid who skates or wants to learn this is a fantastic place to check out."
4-star,1,"very nice and clean indoor skate park. the young man that helped me was very informative on the going ons of the place. came in looking to get items for a young skater,he took the time to help with what i would really need and not what i came in for. some would say that that's a salesman but when he talked me out of spending 100s,when all i needed was 35,that's a tru person of the sport. i will be back for more."
5-star,1,"this place is awesome! just a very friendly and positive environment that is great for all skaters, especially the younger ones! clean and spacious with reasonable prices, not much else you can ask for. my younger brother loved it and i'm sure all skaters would!"
5-star,1,indoors for the az heat and coaches such as myself to help influence the next generation of skateboarding. come in and say hi!
5-star,1,i love this place. mike who runs the place is super cool and excellent with kids. our coach for my son greg and jj are also pretty dope. they've taught my son a lot and we went from having 100% fear to having almost none at all. we do the skate lessons and will continue to do so. this place is awesome. thanks guys a lot!
5-star,1,"what a cool concept! skateboard park indoors! brilliant idea for arizona heat. skateboarding is just so cool for kids of all ages and we can look for it with adults in the olympics too. mike has done a great job with this place. he teaches lessons and his son, laser is pretty awesome on the skateboards himself. mike has a passion for skateboarding and teaching kids how to board. he's cleaning up the sport one kid at a time. this undoor fun skate board park opened 2 months ago and you can buy memberships. dont be scared if you're not great yet cause thats what the leasons are for. also, they sell ramps and skateboards so you can find what you need here. interior is way cool and your kids will fall in love and wont want to leave. great way to keep them active, out of the son and having fun!"
3-star,0,"i love coming here! the drink's and food choices aren't much above your typical cafe, but what distinguishes itself is the atmosphere of a kwerky little cafe shop where you can crack out a chess board for a couple hours."
4-star,1,enjoyed an ice coffee and grilled cheese today. nice homey old fashioned decor with a built in used bookstore. service was awesome and super friendly.
3-star,0,"i was walking along main street when i passed by this place. it caught my attention as it had shelves of books in the back, like a library. only it's a cafe. some of the books have price tags on them so i'm assuming you can buy the books. the drinks and food were reasonably priced. you have to add your own milk and sugar to your drink. the pastries/food didn't look that great, but maybe they taste better than they look. there's also a card you can get stamped so you get a free beverage for every 10 you buy. i ordered a coffee ($1.75 after taxes). there isn't much to say about it, it was a regular coffee. i enjoyed the atmosphere of the cafe. it's a nice place to sit and relax. plus the seats were comfy! there were also a small assortment of boardgames that you can play."
5-star,1,"stumbled across this gem after eating dinner nearby. it has used books, ice cream, coffee, and pastries, and a lot of charm. i can't put my finger on it, but those aforementioned things, as well as old antique furniture and friendly staff made this place seem pretty magical to me. take a look inside and grab a coffee while you're at it."
5-star,1,"love this cafe! lots of character! great cakes and tea! every time we go there it's so peaceful there, and lots of books to pick."
3-star,0,"if you wants to be feel nostalgic, you might like it here at books cafe & things. you will find yourself surrounded by antiques, old books, cds and old country music while you surf on the internet. that might be your only connections here to the modern life. sipping my tea while listening to folks talking about hockey: contracts, lockout, fighting... a small stage in the middle of the cafe which live music events are held on saturdays and even has psychic reading sessions every saturdays. if nostalgic is your thing or you want a change of scenery, books cafe & things might be your kind of cafe."
5-star,1,"i really enjoy shopping at a second look. what great quality items! it feels like you are in a fine boutique, and they are making it better all the time! you can find such great quality items for a fraction of the price of retail. i am a shoe fanatic and have bought 1/2 my best shoes here as well as other fashion items. i also consign here and have always been treated very well and enjoy bringing items which sell pretty quickly because second look has a great customer base, and new people finding out about this hidden gem all the time. highly recommend you check it out yourself!"
1-star,0,"i agree, a 2nd most unpleasant customer experience in a row deserves a review. i will not consign again until the tall, miserable guy is gone! i usually carry a balance but i cashed out my $350 because of him."
5-star,1,"i have been a customer for a long time and the staff has always been friendly, knowledgable, and available when you need to find something. i trade in my clothes and the process is quick and easy. the two men (josh and dave) are always friendly and willing to help you. they work very hard and keep things organized. i think it's the best that i have seen in all the years that i have been there. i like that they have all sorts of other things to buy. it's not just clothes but a lot of household goods to update your decor. it's just a fun place to spend a few hours either buying or looking!"
5-star,1,"omg....i don't know anything about consigning here, but shopping here gets a well deserved 5 stars. i spent over three hours there today! there are so many good deals and the store is extremely clean and organized. i purchased new michael kors sandals, five skirts for work and three dresses for about $50. their awesomely fun system makes it a treasure hunt....a sliding discount scale for how long the item is on their floor. everything i purchased was either 50 or 75% off. definitely fun to shop here. the housewares are very nice too!"
3-star,0,great for the buyers not so great for the seller. they store gets 65% the seller gets 35%. don't take high end golf items here. the appraiser does not seem to know what a taylor made golf driver is worth . they sold mine for $12.50 i got 3% of that .
1-star,0,"i brought in a fontanini nativity village to sell which cost new over $1,000. i did not expect to get $1,000, i was hoping for $200 or less. when i went in to see what i had earned so i could buy more of their stuff. i was amazed to learn that not only did it sell, but there were renewal membership fees, stocking fees and of course, they received very little for the set, so i received $0. what a rip off!!!! do not ever take your items to be sold there! find another store if you want to get any money for them! and never, ever take a high priced item there to sell ever!!!!"
1-star,0,"so here's an eye-opener. i dropped off some things for consignment recently, including a like-new gucci belt i haven't worn in years because it's too small. someone just called to say they won't accept it without a certificate of authenticity. seriously? that's like requiring a certificate of authenticity at a garage sale. i told the caller i could attest to its authenticity because i bought it while working at saks years ago, and to put it in their donation pile. better yet, grab it for herself because a) its real, and b) it shouldn't go to waste. so that's a little window into the quality here - piles of low-end brands but an actual designer piece gets rejected for lack of 'proof'."
2-star,0,"convenient location off of 32nd street and shea. large selection of many different themes of items. layout is a little cluttered yet can be navigated easily. however, my reason for the 2-star rating is that even when i discover some decent merchandise, the staff is so unpleasant that i really don't feel like giving this business my money. there are other stores of a similar nature in the valley that will better appreciate my patronage."
5-star,1,"name a place where you can find buried treasure without having to dig? this place! i love coming here not only for the amazing trinkets i find but also for their friendly staff. my mom, sister, and i have been coming here for over ten years when it was a little store. it's grown so much and although i am sad that they got rid of their little coffee shop, i still love them. this upscale consignment store will have everything you are looking for and more. i wish i lived closer to it because i would be shopping here probably three to four times a week. wait, maybe it's a good thing! =p when you walk in you may not find a cart which kinda sucks but just bring one of those big reusable grocery bags and you'll be set. they offer major discounts on items that have been in their store for more than a month which is awesome. i once bought a fitbit for $12.00. yes, you read that right. 12 dollars. and it worked. i am truly happy for this great place. thank you for existing!"
4-star,1,"enormous selection of clothes, shoes, bags & household goods...at amazing prices. everything beautifully sorted by color & type (skirts, tops, pants, etc.) so it is very easy to zero in on what you're looking for. everything looks clean & gently worn, so there's no ""ick factor"", like in some consignment clothing stores. you cannot beat the pricing and their tags (the ""markdown dates"" are listed) eliminate the need to awkwardly ask ""when will this be reduced?"" household items are in great shape, beautifully displayed and also sorted by color, type of item, etc. there's a big selection of new costume jewelry, makeup & gift items. i agree with other posters: some of the staff need counseling on how to interact with customers, while other employees are very nice. this is a bit of a drive for me, so i'm not often here....but love it when i do get a chance to stop by. it's always a fun & very rewarding experience!"
1-star,0,"beware!! the online ""check your account balance"" does not work. no one answers the phone and i tried for 6 days! i was told i would receive a list of items i took in....never received. i took in a pair of $80 boat shoes (worn only the day i bought them) plus 4 other items and when i went in person to ask where my list of items was, i was told they don't do that. the shoes and one other item were sold....but i was told i owe them 73 cents!!!!!!!! ripoff."
5-star,1,i absolutely love this store. i will not shop anywhere else. the store personnel is just so wonderful i cannot express in words. genuine people who love to see you find your treasures. you just never know what you will find.
1-star,0,"they ""donate"" almost everything you bring in.188 donations in one year! i have heard they have an underground shop in prescott. i will never consign there again."
5-star,1,"everyone should check this place out - there is something here for all tastes. it is such an amazing store! i have bought several shirts and household items here for next to nothing! even the stuff you think you're paying nothing for rings up at a discount sometimes. i haven't quite figured out the tags, but almost every time i check out i am pleasantly surprised by multiple unexpected discounts. the people i have dealt with have been super friendly too, i have read some of the other reviews and been doubtful. maybe every time i have been there i got lucky? i found the people to be customer service bubbly and fun. i also thought the consignment side was very helpful and professional. i will be back many, many times as long as i live in phoenix."
3-star,0,"i love this place, i go there often. i do however agree with a previous review...some of the employees are a bit uppity, cold and unfriendly. so to the ladies that work there, please be helpful and friendly to all customers. i'll be there this weekend."
5-star,1,for women's clothing and household it is the best i have ever shopped at. so much better than the competition in scottsdale. this is an amazing store with great prices and fabulous merchandise. those who give negative reviews are way off. i have brought people there from all over the country and they come back time and time again. they are very organized and quite selective with their merchandise. there is noplace better. i have found the staff extremely friendly and helpful every time i have gone. never have i seen anything overpriced and again the merchandise is high quality.
5-star,1,"wow in reading some of these reviews, i honestly don't understand all the negativity unless they are from competitors trying to bring this place down a notch! i started shopping here about a year ago and the place is fabulous! i can't begin to tell you the wonderful finds i have made here. besides the pricing, what i like is that this store is well organized and all of the items are new or like new. i've purchased things still in the original packaging. the used things are so gently used you sometimes wonder if they are brand new without the packaging. i've been to some other places where the quality is ""early attic"" and the prices are outrageous. this is the place to go for one-of-a-kind, well-priced household items. the shoes and the purses are not bad either! i haven't found a better place to shop than this."
1-star,0,"there was a misleading sale tag stating something with $0.00 when i brought it to the attention of duane she was very rude, told me that she have to figure out the pricing and didn't even say thank you for bringing it to her attention even though by law i should be able to pay what on the price tag which meant it was zero aka free. i didn't like the item and had no plan on buying it but so did want to bring it to their attention and do the right thing. instead i was treated without any dignity or respect and like i did something wrong! talk about getting treated like shit for doing the right thing! see photo."
4-star,1,"i know there are some unhappy campers that have gone to a second look and didn't like the experience. but i have to say i found the way to do it... go with a plan. do i need a new calvin klein business suit for dirt cheap? head straight to the back wall and check the sizes, try it on and get out. do i need something black? just head straight to the color coordinated rack and sift through my size. jeans? same deal. dresses? all on one long rack. this place is very organized and the dressing rooms are never too busy. it can be a great place to find quality clothing that isn't just chicos for a great price. just go with a plan next time...."
1-star,0,"good selection but not worth putting up with the extremely rude employees and management. they have absolutely no patience for children. it's a consignment store, that you would think caters to people on a budget, young mothers, for example. yet they are rude and intolerant of children. that makes no sense. i used to shop there very frequently, almost on a weekly basis but i won't go back anymore."
4-star,1,"have been shopping here for years, the store itself is not much to look at - but the prices are always good. they must cycle the inventory regularly - as i routinely find new things every visit. staff seems friendly too..."
5-star,1,"as a shopper this is prob my favorite store of all times! (not great as a consignor but really, when i buy something i'm not looking to get anything back when i'm done with it.) i have found some amazing business suits, evening gowns, casual attire, purses, and housewares here. i just love it! well organized and clean store. plenty of parking and i enjoy their pricing model."
2-star,0,"based on the postive reviews, i stopped in on a sunday afternoon in search of a good deal. however, i was disappointed in the selection of clothes. while i appreciated the presentation, i was not impressed by the dated fashions offered for sale. i did find a few nice deals in the shoe department. i bought pristine rockport sandals and a couple of pairs of clark shoes. however, i was stung by the return policy. upon closer inspection at home, i noticed one pair of the clark shoes had a tear on the seams. however, because of their return policy, i was not able to return or exchange them. i took the shoes to a shoe repair shop in hopes of repairing them and was told they could not be fixed. :-( it would been nice to if they allowed exchanges for store credit. oh well, it's a $15 reminder to really, really tug and check at all the seems of seemingly new shoes and clothes. :-) overall, i would only recommend this place for shoes and other misc. bric a brac like collectibles. their reductions policy is a boon for buyers in that the longer an item stays in inventory, the higher the discount."
1-star,0,"i was quite disappointed today from a company i've been very happy about in the past. a pity really because i've recommended them to so many friends in the past. well all good things come to an end and as with many the devil is in the return policy. the customer service rep helping me was defensive boarding rude when i attempted to return three shirts i had purchased yesterday. apparently i misread the return policy and thought i had 24 hours but that was just for electronics. though i was calm during the conversation even sharing an idea to take to management that might mitigate such situations in the future she continually assumed my statements and an aggression on my part that was not there. i repeated made statements such as ""i am not upset"" ""i've been on your side of the register"" we finally ended our interaction with her defensive recommendation that i consider reconsigning the shirts. thinking perhaps this was a viable option i took the shirt that had been in my possession for less than 24 hours to the consignment area tags still on. there i spoke with another employee who seemed shocked when i shared that i shared that i had purchased the shirts less than 24 hours before and yet was unable to return them. she, like myself, was under the impression this was the policy. after learning that there were fees involved with reconsigning, and feeling the a second look had already taken my time and enough of my money i departed with the shirts still in had. it is obvious that the staff need training and the policies clarified. i guess i'll try the consignment shop on tatum and bell in the future."
1-star,0,"i haven't been here in awhile but did find a pretty good selection when i did, what annoyed me the most and drove me out of the store b4 i was really finished looking was the ding, ding bell that went off every time soneone came in or out. i know why they do it and it's not for the customer. until they stop (and kohl's did awhile back), i'm not coming back!!!"
2-star,0,"who doesn't love a bargain? i get an adrenaline rush every time i find a great piece at the fraction of the retail price. i don't even mind if it is used as long as it still looks new-ish. i thought a second look would be a great place to get that shopper's rush, but boy was i wrong. the place reminds me of my grandmother's closet because it has the hallmark finicky old woman organization. everything is arranged according to color with signs everywhere proclaiming the consequences of touching and breaking. it is a little overwhelming. the clothes are not that great. everything in the designer section looks like it came off the beverly hills 90210 set circa 1990, and it is marked up like crazy. the rest of the store follows suit; for example, i saw a faded shrunken american apparel dress for $13.00 (i can't even begin to tell you what is wrong with that picture). while i commend the staff for meticulously keeping the store in perfect condition, i did not see anything that i would think of giving a second look."
5-star,1,"great place with great people. i shop here mostly for my work shirts, i have gotten some amazing dress shirts from $4 - $15 since i have been in az. i think my favorite thing about this place is they way they do their discounting. the longer the item has been in the store the more you save up to 75% off. be sure to check the wall in the front of the store for the discount available based on the date on the price tag. right now i am waiting a few more weeks in hopes that this one item i have my eye on hits the 60 day mark. this consignment store has a decent art section, plenty of household decorations and lots of cloths and none of it junk. i find the full non discounted price to be pretty reasonable most times (the item i want right now is overpriced). they go out of their way to be helpful and friendly and i appreciate that."
2-star,0,"this place is better for shoppers than for consigners. on the positive side, i think it is organized well & doesn't feel cramped. from a consigners perspective, their policies have gotten ridiculous. they now charge you a $10.00 annual fee plus $3.50 every time you drop items off. in addition to that craziness, they also want clothing brought in on hangers, pressed/completely wrinkle free. quite frankly i don't have the time to go thru all of my items & either iron them or take them to the dry cleaners (which even if i go to the cheap cleaners for $2.00 & i end up with maybe $3-5 for the item when it sells, doesn't even make it worth the trouble). they also want to take a week or so to go thru your stuff & either donate what they won't take or call you & you have to make another trip to go pick it up. too much time/effort to make it effective for me. it also seems when my items sell, i get less for them than if i would have taken them elsewhere. as said in other people's reviews most of the items they have are very middle of the road (i.e., express, gap, etc), so it's not like they're only taking designer apparel to warrant such strict consignment policies. i will stick to taking stuff to my sister's closet which is easier to work with, they don't charge you fees, and tell you right then & there what they want to take. i feel i also get top dollar for my items at my sister's closet as opposed to here."
4-star,1,"this review is for bringing your stuff in for consignment and based off one purchase. my family used to bring stuff here on a regular basis but not so much anymore, i need to get back into the habit. but when we did bring clothes, accessories, house goods, etc it was was really great, easy and very organized. i purchased my first real furniture sofa and love-seat set from here when i had my first real apartment after college. it was a great set and so affordably priced! i actually kinda miss that set, since then i have bought new stuff for my first real house. i remember the staff being very friendly and helpful. especially when you aren't sure how consignment works, they walk you thru it with ease."
5-star,1,"ok, full disclosure - i know the owners. still, check out a second look and you'll see that they set the bar very high by consignment store standards. it's definitely not your typical second-hand store. for one thing, it's huge - as big as a department store, and the shopping experience is similar in terms of atmosphere and better in terms of selection given the range and uniqueness of the things you find there. the store only accepts ""as-new"" merchandise, so no worries about stains, holes or weird smells. the clothes are sorted not only by style and size but by color, which makes for a more efficient search for random treasures (i'm an attention-deficit shopper, especially when digging through racks of random clothes - so i like being able to save time by looking mainly in the colors that look best on me). you really never know what you're going to find, and their inventory turnover is high, which makes coming back regularly not only fun but practically mandatory. the discounting system is pretty innovative - almost all of the clothing has a dated price tag, and after 30 days on the rack, an item automatically goes 25% off; after 45 days, 50% off; after 60 days, 75% off, and after that it's taken out of inventory and donated to a charity that supports needy women and children. the housewares section is awesome, too - perfect place to find a bargain on the ice cream maker you keep thinking you want, or to change up the decor of your place for a fraction of retail. they have a big kids' section, and their holiday decoration stuff is definitely worth checking out once christmas rolls around. also, there's a coffee bar area tucked away in the back on the other side of the consignor drop-off area. it's a nice place to take a break from shopping, or to give bored companions a spot to hang out. great coffee, too. consigning the good stuff you just don't want any more is much better than just hauling it all to goodwill - at least you stand the chance of making back a little money; worst case, if they don't sell, they'll end up going to charity anyway. update 6/5/09 - no more kids' section here, nor hot coffee at the coffee bar, although cold drinks and snacks are still available. still plenty of great bargains to be had!"
1-star,0,"your items are too expensive for a thrift store. people stopped going to dog junkies thrift store because the prices all of a sudden tripled. your prices are more than regular store prices. you started out as a good thrift store and people enjoyed going there to get the bargain, but now you're overcharging for items. you really need to lower your prices down to thrift store prices if you want to stay in business."
5-star,1,i absolutely love that i found this thrift store. it's located on rancho and has some high end shoes including jordan's and adidas that are barely used. there are signs out front for puppies but don't let that fool you. there is a lot of great stuff inside. women's men's and kids stuff! i highly recommend checking is it out next weekend or just in your free time. brandon sevruk
5-star,1,"i stumbled across this place while driving by. i don't get over here much, so i stopped. i was so glad i did. i am an animal lover so the fact that they support no kill animal rescues is uge for me. you can also volunteer and they give you a discount when you do. they have different daily sales. i can't remember them all off the top of my head, but wednesdays is 50% off clothing. they have a facebook page as well so you can check the sales for whatever day it is. it's clean and it's basically a house, so there are different rooms for you to explore. plan to spend some time if you're stopping in."
5-star,1,really like this place. i especially like the fact the revenue goes to maintain their no kill dog rescue. they have the best selection of quality pet supplies that i have ever seen in a thrift store. saturday is 25% for teachers!
1-star,0,they are so rude here. saw a mirror they had just posted on offer up. came in and they didn't have it and even worse they didn't bother to try and help me to see if they had it or anything. they were so rude about it. i really didn't want to give them any business after their attitudes. made my day of wanting to go search through thrift shops for hidden gems no fun .
1-star,0,"only giving it one star because i can't go any lower. answered an ad from them for a item they had for sale. the ad was entirely false. item was listed as new and in box - probably wouldn't be as mad if when i got there the woman wouldn't have had such a funky attitude. when i answered the ad and i asked if the item was new and was told yes it was. drive way across town to find out not only was it not new but very used, filthy dirty and missing parts. when i questioned it the woman said i had to understand volunteers place those adds and they can't be responsible for mistakes - really? she didn't even have to decency to apologize for their mistake just told me it's still a deal - huh - a broken dirty machine is just as good as new? didn't mind in the beginning because i was going to help a good cause but now i'm just super pissed that you wasted my time and gas and was treated badly by someone who was rude as hell - yes i'm talking to you lady with the short black hair"
5-star,1,"i head straight to the pet supply section first. they have a great selection of dog toys, clothes, leashes, harnesses...everything my babies need. don't get me wrong. the rest of the store is great too. they also carry pawsome jerky. my dogs love it. i know you can order it online too, but this is the only store i've found it in so far. i highly recommend checking this place out. there's so much stuff to choose from and new stuff all the time. plus (and this is the best part) every sale helps dogs in need. total win win."
5-star,1,i came in for a birthday present for my mom olivia helped me out she was super awesome. very attentive gave me really good ideas on what to get. i ended up buying a pair of super cute jeans and a super cute top to go with it! it's great service and great price that keeps me coming to a place and they have both!
5-star,1,olivia helped me pick out the cutest outfit ! she was a lot of help the clothes there are very cute i wanted to buy everything. thanks again olivia for helping me
5-star,1,"the clothes fit well with beautiful styles. customer service is exceptional & jaquelin was extremely helpful in helping me choose an outfit for an upcoming special occasion. the store is always tidy and clean, pleasant to walk in to and shop. totally recommend this store! one of my absolute favorites."
1-star,0,"okay so here's the problem with this store: the clothes are super cute and fairly affordable (albeit they run small) but the staff is pretty immature and bitchy. granted, i've been here before and had zero issues with the employees...so they definitely do have some professional people working. but during my last visit, i asked the simple question of if i could use the dressing room only to overhear the male employee whisper something under his breath to the female employee the moment i turned my back! i'm not sure what was said but i know it was gossip about me because i turned around and they both looked away from me immediately and seemed embarrassed! gossiping about a customer is a huge no-no and as someone who's worked retail i can tell you, they're lucky i didn't cause a scene because i felt pretty offended. to make matters worse, after emerging from the dressing room neither employee offered to help me or even attempt to save face with me! i definitely don't plan on shopping here again, which is a huge bummer to me because i like the clothing a lot. i just will not support a company that condones immature, catty, and unprofessional behavior."
5-star,1,"ramon c. is such an awesome sales associate. he is so funny, and provides the best customer service in the store. :) love him! he helped me pick out the perfect dress."
1-star,0,"review is actually for online purchases. i ordered from aldo on 2/1 i received an order email stating that the delivery should happen no later than 2/12 and that there will another email with shipping details to follow, which i still have not received. today i called aldo because i've not received my order. the guy jimmy on the customer service line said it was delivered on 2/8 and i said that i had not received the order. he said we'll have you looked around? your house i said yes i have since i receive almost daily deliveries from amazon with no issue. he said that they would open an investigation with ups and that i should call back next friday to see if they will be refunding my money. what happened to my order? and now you want me to call back and see if they will refund my money. horrible customer service if you ask me. such a shame."
1-star,0,"the hours on sundays for this location says from 11:00 am to 8:00 pm. i had an event to go to that night so i rushed and got to the store at 7:00pm and they chose to close down the store early to do inventory/restock. that's something you're supposed to do after closing hours, not shut the store down early for that. really disappointed."
1-star,0,"this specific aldo shoe store has extremely bad customer service. i have worked in customer service for a while. i provide exceptional service, and therefore i expect it. the employees seemed like they had attitudes. perhaps they do not like their jobs. i would suggest that aldo corporate sends in some secret shoppers. it is unacceptable when shoppers have to wait and then go up to the employees to ask them to bring out shoes for them. i want to be greeted, smiled at, feel a positive vibe, and i want to be assisted. i like aldo shoes. however, i decided to spend a lot less at this store than i would have if there had been better customer service. i'm sure there are better aldo stores in nevada to spend my time and money at. after leaving aldo, i walked down to steve madden where the customer service and overall, vibe, was better. something must change at this aldo, or i will not return. the employees here must remember to be professional, kind, helpful, and upbeat. instead, they seemed not to give a damn. they left me with the impression that they were rude and stuck up. so again, instead of spending $300+ on aldo shoes, i walked over to steve madden."
5-star,1,"i was on a hunt for heels with no luck. this was our last stop and i was getting a bit discouraged. i looked around and found nothing that i liked. all the heels were just waaaay to high for me to wear at work or were just boring. i eventually found my way to the clearance section where two pairs of flats caught my eye. my friend loren found a pair she wanted to try on as well. the sales associate jazlene was patient with us when we kept switching back and fourth with pairs. she also mentioned that they offer free shipping straight to my house if they didn't have a size in stock. i ended up purchasing the pair that loren tried on for only $30. just comfy black flats to run around in on crazy days at work. although i didn't find what i originally came in for, i still had a good experience and walked out with something else. p.s. they also have really cute accessories like jewelry and purses."
2-star,0,"i like the aldo chain of shoe stores because it is a pretty nice mixture of decent fashion, decent quality leather shoes, at decent prices. for men, it's like clarks or bass with more style, or kenneth cole without the designer price. the two stars is for the staff/service. i didn't like the whiney voice of the person who helped us, she seemed off in her timing and attentiveness, should i say robotic sounding? hey, i helped earn my way through college selling shoes, and later was a junior buyer at a regional department store chain early in my career, so i know a little something about shoes. the girl that helped us didn't. we didn't buy anything, but i professionally reboxed and stacked up the pairs of shoes for them to easily put away. that includes putting back all the tissue, cardboard, plastic, etc. that comes inside the box of every pair. the staff didn't seem to care less. unprofessional. just call me an old shoe dog. but a better breed than al bundy, the loser horn dog."
5-star,1,"this place is very professional and convenient. i took several shirts and sports coats here for alterations. a few of my items, the staff recommended not to alter for one reason or another, which saved me money in the long run. this candor was greatly appreciated."
5-star,1,"omg! they really saved my butt today! forgot my sport coat so bought one and needed sleeves hemmed, they truly did it while i waited saving me a huge embarrassment if i didn't have a jacket for next morning. maybe a bit costly but staff was awesome, fun and friendly and did what i needed perfectly!! gwen rocks!!"
5-star,1,thank you! my husband needed a suit altered to be a groomsman in a wedding the next day and they were so accommodating and kind!! they made the perfect storm of long travels and a way too big suit so much better! he looked quite handsome with the alterations competed and it was ready right when they had said. thank you!!
1-star,0,"do not come here i was way over charged for a crappy hem job. all they did was fold the fabric up and sew it. the worst part is, its a white dress so i can see the line right through the dress. and don't even get me started on the grey stain that's now on my dress. will never come here again, wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
2-star,0,"not sure i'm pleased about this...yet?!? bought red dress @ american commodore with my daughter for homecoming. dad took her for alterations with receipts & tags for amer. commodore. they said need coupon from a.c. to get discount...never was given coupon by a.c. or told needed one. dad prepaid for alterations to get dress done in a timely manner. would still like the discount ...come on, alterations express...you need to have a little business sense. probably won't return for the next 5+ events unless you make it better for us !! will be in to pick up next week...we shall see!! ??????"
1-star,0,their customer service is horrible at this location. the young lady at the desk was unpleasant and seemed bothered. i can't rate their actual services because i turned right around after receiving a horrible first impression of the place by an employee named sarah.
5-star,1,"i came here after reading some great reviews however been very nervous taking my wedding gown here (since i've never used the services before). i would highly recommend this company due to the customer service, high quality work, low prices, and high reviews through theknot!!"
1-star,0,"this was my first bridal appointment and the absolute worst. despite making an appointment on a quiet tuesday morning well in advance and filling out all their online forms as well as creating a wish list on their site of styles i liked, it was a disappointing experience throughout. first they had me refell out the entire information form when i arrived, then the consultant i was given proceeded to tell em none of the styles i showed her, pinned from their site, were not there. despite describing in detail what i was looking for nothing i was given to try on was remotely in the realm of what i was looking for and i felt my concerns and requests regarding style were constantly being dismissed. it was clear my consultant was over it when she walked away saying she would write down the two dresses i didn't hate, but even then she couldn't tell me the designer of the dresses just gave me the sku numbers from their inventory which can't be looked up by anyone but them. horrible experience and absolutely would not recommend to anyone, nothing like what you see on say yes to the dress canada."
3-star,0,"my review for this store is actually 3.5/5. i came here last thursday and said 'yes' to the dress! before coming here, i had already gone to three other places. there was this very specific dress from maggie sottero that i wanted to try on so i called amanda lina sposa in advance to make sure they had this dress before i booked the appointment. the store is really pretty and they have a lot of gowns for you to look at. i went with my mother and my fiancé's mom. we were free to look around while we waited for our consultant. after waiting for about 5 minutes, our consultant arrived. our consultant was helpful and nice. the minute that i tried on the dress that i came here for, i already knew it was the one. so my appointment was really only 40 minutes. the only downside here is that you cannot take pictures, which i knew of already before coming in. after saying 'yes' to the dress, i was measured right away and the dress was ordered for me. because i did my research on this specific dress, i knew that there was a petite size available (3 inches shorter than regular length) because i'm only 5'2"". however, i had to point this out to my consultant and the front desk. but they had already put in the order for the regular size so they had to cancel that order and then place another order for the petite before i paid my 60% deposit. being only 5'2 and between a size 0-2, i think it would've made sense to at least advise your customer of the petite option so they can decide which one to get. but because i had done my research on this dress, i felt like i knew a bit more than my consultant? other than that, the experience was good. you also don't need to alter your dress here if you don't want to. after getting my gown, i also visited the attached store which sells mother of the bride dresses. the ladies there were so lovely and sweet! because i had purchased my wedding gown there, i get an additional 10% off for mother of the bride dresses. my mom and future mother in-law are interested in coming back for their dresses. at this time, i'm not sure if i will be purchasing my accessories at amanda lina sposa. i just noticed in my follow-up email that ""any accessories purchased elsewhere including belts, jackets, etc., are not permitted during your fitting process"". just a heads up for other brides who decide to come here. overall, i would recommend this bridal store to other brides!"
5-star,1,"ladies, let me tell you how amanda-lina saved me! i was going to avenue 22 bridal (on dufferin and eglington area) to get fitted for a bridesmaids dress. i gave it 2 chances (making time, driving across the city) where both times the associate was so snooty, impatient, rude, made unflattering comments about my body type that i absolutely refused to make any purchase of contribute to their profits. after searching for a place that actually sold my dress and dealing with amanda of amanda-lina's directly, she replied back to my voicemail almost immediately, walked me through the dress i needed to order, helped me order the dress and when it came time to picking it up, she (and her team) made things quick, easy, and efficient. if you want to be in good hands for your big day, you must come see amanda. don't even bother talking to avenue 22."
5-star,1,i absolutely loved my experience at amanda lina's! i had a problem with a wedding dress from another store one month before my wedding. i went here and within the first five minutes of walking into the store the consultant (raina-love her) helped me find my dream wedding dress. she calmed me down and made me feel so relieved and excited after having a stressful time with my other dress. i am so excited and can't wait to wear my dress in 3 weeks!!!
3-star,0,"i heard about this shop through a friend who went there, and she informed me that it was the ""say yes to the dress"" store. my fiance and mom were suggesting that i go there to see what the ""experience"" was like, since i was a fan of the show. after doing a lot of research (and reading only negative reviews) i decided not to go there. one day, my mom and i were in the area in between other bridal gown appointments and last minute decided to call up and see if anyone could see me. within 10 minutes, i was in the shop with teresa. i have to say my mind was changed about this place. the store is very pretty, sitting area for your ""entourage"" is comfortable and very luxurious. teresa was nice and made great recommendations. loved all her picks. she thought of a dress at the last minute which was nothing like what i described that i wanted, and it ended up being my favourite! she helped me in and out of every dress! was not pushy at all. downside is that you can't take pictures, this is a huge negative for me. can't ""say yes"" without my maid of honour seeing it! (she lives a couple hours away so this is a big problem). also i would just genuinely like to see how the dress photographs before i purchase it. the other huge negative is that they ripped all tags off the dresses so you can't see the designer of it! (are they that insecure??) i managed to find the designer and dress online in a matter of minutes when i went home. another downside is that you can't look around. all dresses are in the back and they pull things for you. would be nice to at least see a few to determine what style you like. in conclusion, i had a better experience than anticipated, but you just have to weigh the pro's and con's about this place."
1-star,0,"i was originally excited when i purchased an amanda-lina's bridal boutique dress on clearance since i got it for a fairly decent price and it looked like (after careful inspection) that everything was working and in good shape. a couple of months ago, i opened the dress bag to check on the dress and to my horror, when i touched some of the beading along the bust area of the dress, the beads just fell off! i was upset because it looked and felt fine at the bridal show! i did contact them to see if they could remedy this situation but they insisted i would have to pay them a fee for fixing a broken dress (a problem which arose because of their poor workmanship)! i know i took a risk when purchasing a 'final sale' dress but coming from amanda-lina's i thought i could trust the quality of their work. i guess not. so if you're a bride-to-be i'd say skip the headache and guesswork of which dresses are good quality or not and buy somewhere else. and if you've already purchased one, be very very thorough inspecting the dress. good luck!"
1-star,0,"worst ann taylor store i have seen. 3 people working. only people in the store and not acknowledged. worst service in any location i've seen. dirty floors. atrocious folding and sizing standards. wife had a loyalty coupon they would not acknowledge because price was 50 cents off, although coupon didn't state any pretax minimum. a complete embarrassment to your company. clearly leadership here is poor."
1-star,0,"i tried to apply here before, a long time ago. i had an interview with the manager. the manager was so racist! just cause i'm asian and she's white blonde lady. as i was about to walk out the store after the interview with her, she came running to stop me. i was like what's going on? she was like "" i have to check your bag"".. like wtf? who does that? its not even a five star store or any expensive store like branded store, like louis vuitton, gucci or valentino. its just a regular ann taylor. i would understand her stopping me and checking my bag if i had an interview with an expensive store. but hell she's freakin racist and rude. found a better job some place else. i don't think i want to work for her or at this place."
1-star,0,i'd give this place 0 stars if i could. the manager is a racist and the overall service is terrible. stay away from this store
1-star,0,worst customer service ever. i come here once a week hoping something will change. nope. today was the last time i'll ever come.
1-star,0,i recently got a back injury and the sale associate didn't seem to mind shoving me to one side to help another customer with finding a size. i wanted to get to the other side so i said excuse me. the lady said as soon as she's done she'll move. the sale associate was the blond lady with long hair. i was sooo offended that i left. please fire this filth right away!!!
1-star,0,"i just got home from visiting this ann taylor location. i was happy to see the store in the venetian close. they had horrible customer service there, and this place is even worse. i wasn't greeted entering the store. i had to find someone to let me into the dressing room. she just walked me into the dressing room and pointed to an open room. she didn't bother to mention her name if further assistance was needed. i had to buy three suits as i work in finance. i am happy to purchase them elsewhere. my money won't go to this store - ever."
2-star,0,"came in to look for some work wear, and found a couple of items. you need to come in with an open mind as it's usually hit or miss. there is an extensive sale/clearance section if you have some time to peruse. what this store is lacking is the customer service. when i walked in, there was no greeting - ok, fine because no one was near the front. as i walked around the store, i saw sales people but none of them said hello. when i went to check out the sales person asked for my email address and i asked for what - she said it was for the receipt so returns are easier. then i asked if i will be put on a marketing list, and she said no. well that's a lie. i have received email offers since. the last thing was that when i walked out of the store, i must not have noticed the store alarm beep, and none of the associates stopped me. i walked into a couple other nearby stores and i beeped upon entrance, and it was after the second store i knew it was my (first) purchase at ann taylor. i had to walk back and ask the sales person to deactivate the sensor. no apology for the inconvenience. will i come back - not likely unless i'm bored and desperate. i'll go to another ann taylor or another store all together for my purchases."
1-star,0,"zero stars. absolutely no help, no hello, nothing. i even had to find a dressing room by myself. size 00 pants are too big for me anyway. but i definitely will not come back for anything else!"
1-star,0,materials used to be of good quality now ann taylor use cheap materials and denim style is all curvy. i don't buy anymore but i'm a customer for 2 decades so disappointed with store.
4-star,1,i have been shopping at this store for a few years now and i really like it. its a huge store with some amazing stuff. on my most recent visit i came in looking for spring dresses. they have such cute dresses in for spring. i had my little one with me so i just picked a few things and bought them & would return any that didnt work out. well i had 1 item to return so i came back a day later. the sales girl was very helpful and the return went smoothly. i hate it when they ask a bunch of questions. but she was not like that all. very polite. i look forward to coming back in a couple weeks to see if any of the other dresses i liked go on sale. they have great sales all the time here. i picked up a few tops that were already marked 40%off and they were an additional 40% off. love that!!
5-star,1,"i love this outlet store!!! it's huge, featuring ann taylor loft (the sportier, younger version of the popular ann taylor branding) there are lots of deals and steals, especially in the clearance section, back left of the store, and there are lots of friendly staff on the floor- they'll offer up bags and starting dressing rooms for you as well as tell you about the current promotions- extra percentage off the marked prices. i did not intend to purchase anything as i already picked up a few things yesterday morning, but when i saw the clearance section, i spotted so many cute dresses (i love dresses, in case you don't know me by now, or have not read my reviews in the past, i wear dresses to work during spring and summer; i'm a dress addict). of course, i had to decide between two dresses, but one fit me like a glove, so i got the black and white one, which was marked $24.99. even the lady helping me, told me that it looked really good on me and suggested pearls or the jewelry that was on sale, but i told her that i didn't need any more jewelry. on second thought, i might snag that other dress that i liked, sometime in the next couple weeks- it was super cute and hard to pass up at $19.99! the fitting rooms are to the back right of the store. my husband sat in the single chair, which he dubbed, ""oh that's where the husbands will sit, waiting for their wives."" it didn't take me long to show him my selections. i want gift cards to this store- that's how much i love it!!! the styles are very cute and on par with banana republic, and there are so many different colors, styles, and price ranges- all affordable work attire, which i adore. i like classic and somewhat trendy but not young-teenage-trendy, so somewhere in the middle. the sizing is a little bit bigger, for example, the dresses i tried on were x-small and small (i typically wear a size 8 dress in womens). i thought it was worth mentioning. the signs are visible and clearly indicate the extra savings (woo hoo!). the mannequins and displays are nicely spaced, as this is a large store, so it does not feel cramped at all. good use of space, good amount of clothing on the floor. this store is located in the new part- the front of the outlet center facing las vegas boulevard. since we walked the bulk of the interior of the center, we went to one end, and then to the front of the center, and back to where we parked (the other side where we started)."
4-star,1,"i absolutely love ann taylor's clothing! the store is clean, spacious & surprisingly neat. there were a lot of great deals (up to 60% off) after christmas! my only complaint, they need to get more people on the floor to assist customers."
5-star,1,"the shopping spree continues, anthropologie was big, roomy, and staff was more pleasant than the one in cleveland.... made the girls shopping experience unique"
5-star,1,i actually love this anthropologie and find the staff warm friendly and extremely helpful. i can't say enough good things about the entire shopping experience.
1-star,0,"i've come to this store several times and the staff is horrible each and every time . yesterday i walked in, a staff member looked at me, then rushed to the register area. maybe i'll give my money to free people!"
4-star,1,"i am a big clothes shopper and also hippie at heart. i have always loved the clothing at anthropologie and the ones i've visited (mainly in the south) have given me great vibes. i love that we now have one in pittsburgh and would highly recommend anyone who wants to be inspired by clothing/art/design to take a trip to anthropologie. it is located in the new bakery square below the gym and is next door to a new free people store, also a favorite. the prices are a bit expensive especially when it comes to shirts and accessories, however i think that sale days are the way to go! today (6/2/11) i went into the store and there was a great sale selection and tops that were usually $50 were only $20 or $30. makes a big difference if you buy several things, which i usually end up doing whether i mean to or not! the clothing is also worth the extra dough! comfy! soft! lasts through washes! awesome! the staff in the store every time i've been in has been great and always helps you in the best way that they can and calls you by name once introduced. very genuine! 4 stars, but only because when there isn't a sale you definitely have to watch your purchases and just be mindful (if you are on a budget that is)"
4-star,1,"i don't agree with the previous review. when i shopped there during the christmas rush, the employees i spoke with were friendly and helpful. love the store chain itself and their merchandise. it is expensive though."
1-star,0,"i use to love this store when they had the orginal owers but now since the new owners have taking over..... the style, uniqness, and quality is not there!!!! please go back to purchasing clothes like the orginal owners did.....i see why the other 2 stores have closed and it want suprise me if the one in birkdale closes too. they need new buyers...."
4-star,1,"chic, chic, chic! i really like this place and any time i'm looking for a really fly top, belle ville is my first stop and they never disappoint. eye popping gear for that special event without the worry of someone else showing up with a duplicate:-). the sales associates are fashionista's and very helpful. with so few shopping venues uptown, belle ville is a great find."
5-star,1,"i stopped in the belle ville in birkdale over the weekend and bought my girlfriend a few really nice shirts and jewelry. the pricing is affordable (especially in this market) but its cool stuff. (not your mom's chico clothing line! ha!) anyway i would def recommend it when you are in the charlotte area. friendly staff, very nice unique clothing items and reasonably priced. i think there are 3 of them in charlotte area."
5-star,1,"took my wife here based on allesandra's review (as well as lunch at mez) -- thanks a lot. the clothes are very cute and more of the one of a kind types. my wife loved the selection and bought 3 dresses ranging from $40 to $60, several t shirts that were very colorful and unique, and some fun jewelry. the service was great. we will definitely be back!"
4-star,1,"bold colors and one-of-a-kind tops that will make you stand out. reasonable prices, and some funky jewelry. they've also got some classic pieces, like the awesome black fall jacket that i fell in love with - definitely the kind of piece to add to your wardrobe that you will get lots of use out of, and under $100. the girls who work here are friendly, and they've got a decent size sale section in the back. i saw some great summer finds - go get 'em ladies!"
5-star,1,"just bought a pair of shoes here and i can honestly say it was the best shoe buying experience i've had. i brought my old running shoes in and david, the owner, looked at the wear, asked me about what i did and didn't like about them, and then asked me to take off my shoes and walk around a bit so he could see my gait. then we went to the treadmill where we could see my gait as i walked. he got a few shoes for me to try and eventually took me onto the treadmill to see how the shoes i'd selected affected my gait. he was also super helpful in helping me choose the right size of superfeet orthotic for my foot. overall, just what i was looking for. i feel like i got a mini session with a very friendly running coach."
5-star,1,this store is staffed by incredible runners/walkers. while prices are high it's worth the quality. if the shoes don't work they have a great return policy. local business owner. great location and free parking is available.
5-star,1,"i had my first ever experience at berkeley today; i walked in and immediately was greeted warmly by the owner. he listened patiently to my running story and what i was looking for. he gave some great suggestions and got me going with mike, who was equally as awesome. never once did i feel rushed--i felt important as a customer and very welcomed. i will be back!"
5-star,1,"i really like this place. the staff has always been helpful and polite, without pressuring me to buy stuff. they're definitely willing to take the time to get you the right shoes for your feet. they probably have the best selection of random running gear of any running store in madison, which is very nice. even though the store can seem a bit crowded, that's much better than some other stores which are open and airy and never have what i need. their prices seem in line with what you'll pay anywhere else for decent running gear, at least the brick and mortar stores in town. since i live east of town, i don't know what their training programs are like, but it's nice that they have some. since madison lacks a significant, independent running club, it's up to the local shoe stores to fill in the gap."
5-star,1,"while i was shopping here, i mentioned to the owner that this place is very impressive. he quickly said ""hopefully not too impressive?! i don't want to frighten people the way some athletic stores do with too much gear."" see, this would have been my impression of the place had it not been for the incredibly friendly demeanor of the owner and the staff as a whole. the level of service at this place is top-notch, the sort of service and expertise you secretly hope for (and pay for) at small boutiques. as soon as i walked in, i was greeted and brought to an associate who got to work getting to know my feet. they asked me what i was looking for and what my activity level was, watched me walk around, correctly pointed out some orthopedic abnormalities that needed correcting, and set about looking for precisely the right sort of shoe for my lifestyle and physiology. we then tried on at least eight pairs of shoes, covering a wide gamut of options in terms of shapes, fits, and designs. all during this, he answered questions i had about running shoes, their mechanics, their care, and other sundry things that i've always wanted answered but never knew anyone knowledgeable enough to answer them. the last time i had that sort of attention, i was at saks being fitted for a suit. in short, the service here is impeccable. and if you want anything better than the cheapest disposable sneakers from zappo's, then come here and buy the right pair. ps: i checked in on yelp and they gave me a coupon for $10 off! so don't forget to do that."
5-star,1,"wide selection of shoes and running gear and all of the staff are super educated about their products. for a noob like me, the staff have offered good options on shoes while not being pushy. one of the employees, steve, has helped me check out twice and has been very helpful in particular."
5-star,1,"huge selection in stock, very friendly and knowledgeable staff. they also have student discounts! i wear a weird size (w 10.5) and i was amazed by the options i had. and the shoes i bought are perfect!!"
1-star,0,"my husband and i traveled an hour to madison to come to this store. we walked in and were greeted right away. +5 stars. i started talking to the man about my running habits and he just looked at me and with a look in his face like, ""why is this woman telling me about her running habits?"" he was so uninterested in what i was looking for or my concerns with my running. i asked to run on the treadmill and expected him to assess my running...you know...because we are in a specialty running store. i got on the treadmill twice and not once did he ask me how the shoes felt, looked at me, or anything. he made me feel like i was a burden and that my business was not wanted. -4 stars (it would be -5 if that were possible on yelp) so, i said f*** it and bought them somewhere else."
5-star,1,"i went in to pick out a new pair of running shoes even though i couldn't buy them for a few more weeks. the employee helped me determine what types of shoes would be best and even helped me find quality shoes for a low price. he made sure the fit was correct and that i would be comfortable running, which was a concern returning from an ankle stress fracture. updated: went back in to actually buy the shoes i picked out and everyone was so helpful again! they made sure i got the right size and fit since i was in between sizes and assured me that if i tried them out and don't like them right away i can bring them back!"
5-star,1,"this is my first store to get fitted properly for a pair of running shoes. my first visit was a year ago, where i was promptly greeted by the owner, david, immediately upon walking in. as he led me to the back of the store where the running shoes are he asked about my running routines and style etc, making me very relaxed the entire time. david measured my feet, analyzed my walking style and started bringing out pairs of shoes for me to try. he even went to the sales rack to see if there were any that fits my running style to help save some money on them. david and his team are really patient with me. they never insist on a particular pair just because they think it is good. they go out of their way to pair you up with shoes which you find comfortable. it was training with that pair of shoes which saw me complete my first 10 k run. recently i went back again to look for another pair of running shoes. unfortunately i picked a wrong time as a series i was hoping to try on were out of stock because a new model will be launched the next month. but david and his team are as nice as always, never pushing me to buy a different product, and even thanked me for stopping by. david and his team knows a lot about running and are always enthusiastic to share their experience and tips with you. they are also concerned about their customers: there was someone with a blister on her foot. david saw it as he was measuring her feet. he asked her how she got it and offered tips to avoid it in the future. berkeley has running clubs for people of all standards and various discounts for students etc. just check with their friendly team of professionals who clearly love what they do."
5-star,1,love this place! the level of customer service provided by david and his staff is unparalleled by any store that i have shopped in for as long as i can remember. i brought my daughter in for her cross country running shoes for the second year in a row and was treated so well i would never consider going anywhere else. (david actually greeted us at the door and remembered that we had been there before...wow!) they made sure she had the right shoes for her feet and she couldn't be happier with them. they have tons of other cool products for runners too! can't say enough great stuff about them...the best!
5-star,1,i'm brand new to running and was very intimidated by going into a running shop. the owner immediately made me feel welcome and comfortable. the gentleman that fitted me for shoes was patient and very informative. i just completed my first run in the shoes that i bought and am very pleased!
5-star,1,"this store is awesome! i had a terrible experience at another specialty running store, so when i walked in here i was pretty frustrated and apprehensive, but i couldn't be happier with the level of service i received. they took the time to ask me all kinds of questions about my running style, watched me walk, then had me try several different shoes on the treadmill with the video monitor to show how my feet move. i found a fantastic pair of shoes at a really good price. i will definitely be going back here for all of my running shoes, and will highly recommend them to everyone."
5-star,1,"pretty great! got a lot of food for a little $$$. funniest thing? being here from so cal, i'm trained to not use plastic bags. in fact now they are banned. if you need a bag you buy it. that one is heavy duty and recyclable without special trips to a grocery store bag drop. well i told the cashier not to bag. i'd put them in my cart and bag them as i load them into my car. she said...that's weird...i feel like i'm not doing my job! i lmao!"
2-star,0,so i bought two piece sofa and love seat really loved by t after 2 months the sofa is coming a part i called 3 times before someone replace it. now two months later not only is it breaking in the back but when i sit you fall straight to the ground. spend like 750 with delivery i called twice already and they said a manager would call me and it's been 4 days no call. my next step is to write a letter and i explain my situation. signed completely disappointed
2-star,0,"just bought a sectional at big lots. we are on a budget and we were excited to get our new sectional for a reasonable price. i would have given big lots more stars, however their delivery service is way too expensive. we live 15 miles from the store and we were told that their base price to deliver was $55. when the delivery service called us, it was $75.00. not good. most people that shop at big lots- we are there to save money, not get gouged on delivery. i tried to negotiate with the delivery service and the person i talked to was not nice. won't be buying anymore furniture at big lots"
5-star,1,i dont get the negative reviews! this place is great! everyone is extremely friendly - as they walk by they ask if they can help you and introduce themselves and let you know if you need anything to just ask. i've made small talk with a few of the employees there and i thought they were great! store is clean and has a great selection.
1-star,0,"i'm embarrassed to admit that i bought something from here. the prices are higher than walmart and the floor employees are twice as rude. went in to buy a dog bed with my 79 year old mother and encountered the worst cashier ever. (very large african american woman with acne and a tight fitting shirt that didn't quite cover everything -- why she wasn't sent home to change into something that didn't violate nudity laws is beyond me.) the item had no price tag so we asked for a price check. she disappeared for 7 or 8 minutes and left us waiting in line (causing the line behind us to grow longer). she came back with a totally different item and wanted to use that for the price. when my mother told her it wasn't the same, the cashier said, ""it's the same size"" -- which it wasn't obviously. she argued with my mother for 5 minutes and tried to hoodwink her on the price, being overtly dishonest -- apparently she thought since my mom was a senior, she could be cheated and lied to without consequence. i had had enough at that point. when i asked for the manager, the cashier threw a fit, grabbed the store phone and yelled for the manager. the manager showed up, apologized, and got the price right. all the while, the cashier in the back was still smirking and very obnoxious. she should be fired or at least put in a position where her exposure to customers is limited (like stocking shelves after hours.)"
1-star,0,absolutely the most rude manager. i returned a floor power cleaner because when i opened the box the nozzle was full of hair & dirty. the manager said well this has been used. if she would have looked at it she would have realized it came that way. she was very rude to me and finally returned my money. i will never shop there again !
1-star,0,"beware! i called the store before i drove down to double check the prices on student notebooks. the clerk who answered assured me that i can still get notebooks for .17 cents each. i was even assured there's no purchase limit (teacher). so i drove down and the prices changed to .90 cents each. i asked why and if they would honor the lower price since i just called and spoke to someone less than 15 minutes ago. ...the clerk just shrugged her shoulders and said, no. be careful! i used to love this store and shop here but now they have lost a loyal customer!!!!"
2-star,0,"i've shopped here off and on over the years. i was shocked when i went in this morning to find that the prices went up - and not by a little. some of the toys i saw there cost more at abig lots as the same toys at target or walmart. ive never seen that before at this store. the store is stocked full and is so disorganized. if i am going to spend that amount, i might as well go to walmart or target and have an easier return policy should anything need to be returned. sure, there are little things there that you can't fid anywhere else, and that is the bonus. but the downside, the lines. one cashier per shift. now that the snowbirds are back, it's not worth it."
5-star,1,"the guy who helped me really explained everything to me: cushioning, support, weight. i tried on about 6 pairs of shoes, ran a bit in them in the store, and went with something with a bit less cushioning and weight than my old mizunos. i felt like he really took the time to make sure i found the right pair of shoes for me. i just got home, can't wait to run in these new babies!"
5-star,1,"a force de courir je me devais de changer mes chaussures. après m'être renseigné j'ai entendu parler de cette boutique. leur site est complet et permet de se faire une idée sur le business et les chaussures vendues. on parle ici avec des spécialistes, des personnes qui courent, utilisent les produits et les connaissent bien. il y a un peu d'espace à l'intérieur qui permet d'essayer les chaussures avec quelques foulées et donc de se faire une idée un peu plus précise que de l'essayage statique. pour ma part j'avais plusieurs modèles en tête que je voulais essayer et la vendeuse m'a sortis une paire que je n'avais pas envisagé. au final elle est devenue ma paire et par rapport à ma façon de courir c'était clairement un meilleur choix vis à vis des autres. je ne peux que féliciter les conseils de la vendeuse qui m'a vraiment aiguillé sur les bonnes chaussures. elle m'avait conseillé de prendre une grandeur de plus, je n'avais pas écouté son conseil et finalement elle a eu raison (tête de mule inside). j'ai donc après ma première course repris contact avec eux pour demander un échange et il a été accepté pour une pointure plus grande. on m'a mis la paire de coté et je suis allé la chercher rapidement :) il y a aussi pleins de vêtements de course et même une personne pouvant vous donner des conseils sur la course (kinésiologue et entraîneur de la clinique). un magasin donc très complet sur l'environnement de la course à conseiller quelque soit votre niveau de pratique sportive :)"
4-star,1,"whether you are a veteran marathoner or a brand new runner you should come here for all your running needs. the store is located right on saint denis and isn't far from beaubien metro. if you drive they have a small parking lot for clients which is appreciated since the parking is metered in this area. they have an excellent selection of shoes for all types of running gaits and they carry a lot of asics shoes which scores big points with me since i swear by this brand for my running shoes. the staff are very knowledgeable and if you don't know what kind of shoe type you need they will be able to help you with that. in addition to that they carry tons of running clothes for all seasons and accessories like fuel belts, hats and so on. the store is pricey but then again i have yet to find an affordable running store in montreal. sometimes if you are lucky you will find stuff on sale but if you don't be prepared to shell out the money for whatever it is you want to buy. they also offer running clinics to prepare you for races so if you are toying with the idea of running a race and would like to train in a group with some coaching look into this. these clinics work up to a specific goal race. they can be a great way to get into running or to take it up to the next level."
4-star,1,came here to pick up my race kit last weekend. the place looked nice and friendly. they didn't have the gels (to eat) that i usually eat but they didn't push any others because they know people are particular about their gels haha. i'm going to go back since i have a $25 gift card and will update on the service
5-star,1,"magasin spécialisé dans la course à pied, tant pour la vente d'articles que pour les cliniques de course. je m'y suis rendue pour le grand choix de chaussures de course mais également pour avoir de bons conseils. le vendeur a bien analysé mon patron de course pour me conseiller la meilleure chaussure. je le conseille à tous les coureurs quelque soit votre niveau. pour les gens du coin qui se cherchent un groupe de course allez-y, c'est toujours plus motivant de courir en groupe."
1-star,0,"buyer beware. they don't do returns, only store credit. for a $70 bra. think before you shop here. super uncomfortable. they did ""a fitting"", and in the store it seemed really snug, but they assured me that's normal... it's a new bra, and this is the proper fitting, they said. i couldn't wear it longer than 20 min. too uncomfortable. went to return it and they informed me they don't do returns. huge sign, i didn't see, my bad. just want to help other ladies. don't shop here."
5-star,1,where do i begin? i had my first bra fitting today and it was amazing!! i have finally found the perfect fitting bra!! for years i have wasted so much money on bras that never quite lived up to my expectations. i have two drawers full of bras that i never wear but one 'go to' bra that is the most worn. the ladies that work here know their stuff! i feel like my posture is better and i look so much better in all my clothes!! never again will i order from adore me or some website like that. you ladies rock!!
5-star,1,"this is the go-to place. mr. bra knows his inventory and how to get you the perfect fit. he is no nonsense. although he is ""in your space"", it is all professional and handled quickly. a little on the pricey side, but well worth it. having been ""blessed"" since i was 13, i have never in 40 years had a better fitting bra. i won't be buying my bras anywhere else. i stopped in to pick up a strapless for my daughter's wedding. i have never had a strapless bra that fit so well. the girls stayed in place and i didn't feel like they were going to fall out, or that the long line was going to roll up on me."
5-star,1,"i've been wearing ill-fitting bras for years, and now i will only shop here. don't let the location and look of the store deter you if you need a good bra. after finding them on yelp and reading such great reviews, i've been wanting to come here for probably a year. my shopping experience was so easy, the expertise and professionalism was remarkable. i allowed myself an hour and was done in 10 minutes. i will be back and send friends!"
5-star,1,great place. i wear a hard size to find bra and have a lot of skin allergies which makes it almost impossible to find a bra to meet my needs. the staff was very helpful and found me a great bra. parking is not the best and not in a great location. but you can't beat the selection and price.
5-star,1,"after hours of wasted time at vs, macy's, and target, we came across cc's online. despite some of the reviews, we headed straight there. 30 minutes later left with 4 fantastic bras. the service, knowledge, and professionalism was on point. no bs here. they have been fitting larger busted women for decades and it shows. a customer for life! thanks c c's!"
5-star,1,"i am seriously so glad i stumbled across this gem on yelp! i always knew i was bigger than ddd but wore that size for years anyways because i didn't want to spend $60 for a bra off line that wouldn't properly fit me either. but i didn't realize that my actual size is 40m. i was properly fitted yesterday at cc's and it actually took me longer to find the place than it did for me to walk out with a new bra for a very reasonable price! i'd say if you're going off of gps, make sure it takes you to near thomas rd and 32nd street because when i clicked on the address on yelp, my gps opened up on my iphone but it took me to a neighborhood around 50th street and camelback.... so i wasted about 30 minutes of my time because of that but that's probably a glitch on my iphone maps. anyways, i will never buy from anywhere else as long as cc's is here and i would recommend it to anyone who needs lingerie."
5-star,1,"i'd been putting it off for months. i needed a new bra, a bra that fit properly. my friend had told me about cc's, insisting that i go there and so finally, on saturday afternoon, i told my husband ""i'm going to the bra store."" i was going to a party that night and i did not want to be squirming and adjusting all evening. when i arrived the young lady was checking out another client so i wandered around the store, checking out the fancy lingerie. the transaction was taking a bit and the store is quite small so i was trying to not be too awkward. finally it was my turn. the young lady asked me a few questions, took some measurements and returned with a nude colored specimen. she helped me get strapped in, made some adjustments and showed me how to bend over and wiggle those girls in. boom. done. new bra that fits great and also has me feeling a bit perkier. my entire transaction was so quick and painless, i couldn't believe i'd put it off for so long! i got home with my purchases and my husband said ""i thought you were going to the store"". he too was surprised such a transaction could be done so quickly (however, he knows this will never be true when it comes to buying shoes.)"
5-star,1,"i discovered cc's yesterday when i had a bit of a bridal bra emergency. it was the day before my wedding dress fitting and after failed attempts of ordering bras online and having them show up only to not fit right, i was in a bind. i didn't think there was a chance i would find somewhere locally that carried my size...but thank goodness i was wrong! someone suggested cc's to me, so i went in and the girl was so helpful. i showed her a photo of my dress, which has a very unique cut in both the front and back (so on top of wearing a hard-to-find size, i was faced with the task of finding something that would work with this dress). she measured me, put me in a bra, showed me some tricks to make it work with the cut of my dress and sent me on my way. bra shopping is usually a painful task, but i was in and out of there in 10 minutes with exactly what i needed. added bonus, the bra/corset that she sold me is lacy, gorgeous and super slimming...i feel beautiful in it! way better than any of the others that i had tried on previously. so grateful i found this place!"
5-star,1,been going to get my bra's here for years. cant say enough.... i have plus size twin ladies and always had bruises and shoulder/back pain until i began to buy my bras here. beatrice is the best and the bras last a very long time (as long as you take care of them). going back tomorrow for a few more!
5-star,1,highly recommended for fitting that really works! they say don't worry about numbers and letters; just let us fit you. service by young lady excellent-also many garments for wearing w special gowns.
5-star,1,"my partner and i had a wonderful experience here! i'm from la and was visiting some friends in arizona. this store is much better with more selection than many of the plus size stores in la and the owner definitely knew his business. i needed some lingerie and had a rough idea of what i wanted and the owner not only measured me for an accurate fit but the first garment he suggested fit like a dream. it supports ""the girls"" but also made me feel very sexy. he also made sure that i had the perfect size thigh highs to go with corset. thank goodness i can also order online and will be doing so the next time i need more lingerie or a new bra. so glad i found this place!!"
5-star,1,"cc's will get you the right bra, couldn't be better. the fitting is pretty quick, he'll measure the underbust, bust, and overbust. after that, whatever bra is suggested you'll put your boobs in the cups and arms through the straps then let the fitter know you're ready for him to adjust the straps and fasten it. trust their judgement! i'd never worn an unlined bra before, but thanks to their suggestion i have seen the light! including some chit chat at the counter, i was in and out in under 20 minutes. the service is great, no messing around, they just get it done!"
5-star,1,"the girls are so happy right now. the other reviews are spot on - expert service and advice, a huge selection. the store is not fancy, but for those of us who are never going to find a bra that fits shopping at victoria's secret, this place is bliss. i will definitely be back."
5-star,1,"this is the place - if you can't buy at v.s.; if you're tired of clueless ""fitters"" telling you a 34f is the same as a 36d; if you know cups come in j sizes, if your back hurts, you are a aaa, or you have a specific need like bridal, mastectomy, etc.. you know who you are. this is not the place to 'browse', everything is sorted by size and they grab it for you. this is a function shop. function can be pretty too, but this is function, first and foremost. so the neighborhood is not scottsdale, big deal. it's easy to find. parking out front. if your girls need some bra loving get in the car and drive here. beatrice measured me in 2 seconds, and i knew she was right with the size because i've been hard to fit my entire life. i told her what i needed/wanted- i had 3 items in mind. she brought me one item for each need. they all fit perfectly. i didnt' ask to see other options. my goal was achieved. i was in and out of there in 10 minutes, there was a bride next in line for her needs. prices were more reasonable than i expected. i'm used to paying about $80 - $90 for each bra. i walked out with 3 for less than $200."
5-star,1,"love this place! go in, get measured, she brings you the perfect bra! the girls are lifted and separated.... need i say more?!!!!"
5-star,1,"i was in and out in under 15 minutes. she had me sized up in 15 minutes and in a bra in less than 20. for a girl who is an ""h"" this is an amazing thing...i didn't even shed a tear. i bought three great bras for $218, that is nothing when i've spent an average of $90 per bra. i will be back and this will be the only place i will go."
5-star,1,"all right ladies, you seriously have to try this place for your next bra...! i am a generously endowed woman and have always had trouble finding bras that would fit me. on a whim this morning i went to cc lingerie where i handed ""my girls"" over to beatriz. she asked me about my style, then took a quick measurement and told me ""you are a perfect 38 g."" she came back with.... the perfect fit! i even looked thinner with a great fitting bra. i took one in black and one in nude and i was out the door in less than 15 mins . the 2 bras i bought were 49.99 each, totally in line with department store prices, plus personal service. i will never buy another bra anywhere else!"
5-star,1,"ok. seriously! the most painless bra shopping experience ever!! beatrice is a doll, and makes you feel completely at ease the moment you walk in. i'm back in my car to leave in less than 15 minutes with 4 new perfectly fitting bras (2 bras, each in nude & black). she never made me feel rushed or pressured, just listened to what i need and brought it over to try on. the new bra felt so great, she just cut the tags off and i dropped my old tattered bra in their garbage! (the only other use i could think of would be as a dog pull toy, but that seemed like recycling gone too far, even for me!) i feel like a new woman going off to new adventures with happy girls leading the way!!"
4-star,1,"i am in shock. i just walked in, talked to a lady, she brought me a bra, it fit, i paid for it and left in five minutes. i have never had a bra buying experience that wasn't a marathon of searching through racks to find my size. i usually buy my bras online, but i am pregnant and knew that i needed a fitting to see what size i am now, so i decided to make the 40 minute drive to this store. so worth the drive! it is in a sketchy area, and there are a lot of signs and visual clutter when you walk in, so you might miss the signs saying that there is a $25 fitting fee (i didn't see them, but my mom did.) if you know for sure what size you are because you've been professionally fitted, then i'm not sure how the experience would be. another reviewer mentioned that they service the drag community, and that does seem to be the case, as i saw a gentleman in drag walk in during my short visit. but i'm not sure why that would matter in your own shopping experience. parking does suck, but there were spaces when we went on a saturday afternoon. it was a great experience with a staff who knows their bras & boobs! go. you won't regret it."
5-star,1,"finally made it c c's after getting a recommendation from a co-worker. based on a couple of reviews, i expected to see a store located on a street/block with derelicts and criminals hanging around. none of that was true. although the shop is located in an older area of phoenix, there is nothing seedy about it. having been born and raised in l.a. i know what seedy looks like and that wasn't it. i wasn't worried about my car being parked there and i drive a convertible. my mother and i went in and walked up to the counter. art was in the back near the dressing rooms and waved us back. while very ""matter of fact"" i still found him to be warm, friendly and humorous. he offered my mother a chair and directed me to the dressing room. he asked me several questions about what type of bra i was looking for, measured me (42h) and then shooed me into the dressing room, closed the curtain and directed me to remove my top and bra. in less than 60 seconds he was back with a bra for me to try on. told me to put it on and he would hook it in the back for me. i came out and modeled the bra and the fit appeared to be perfect. he had me put my top on over it and i confirmed that my ""girls"" looked good in the bra and it was comfortable. he asked me if i wanted to wear it and after telling him yes, he removed the tags. i then told him that i would take two more. the entire fitting probably took no more than ten minutes. at no time did i feel nervous or disturbed over the fact that he was a man. (besides, how many of us go to male gynecologists?) this man definitely knows his craft, and that is fitting bras. it is definitely not the ""chi chi poo poo"" type of lingerie shop where you go to browse, but i'm pretty sure that if you know what you want, they probably have it. i will definitely make the trek to cc's (from surprise to phoenix) for all of my bra needs."
5-star,1,"i read the reviews on numerous sites and didn't know if i should try it. the last time i was fitted was 6 years ago when i was pregnant. i am writing this to give you all an honest opinion. i am a very large size (i) and had been craming into smaller bras. i've gained weight because i quit smoking so i needed to finally break down and buy some new bras. i already made my mind up that if i felt uncomfortable or the owner was in a bad mood (i had read this) i would leave. i went into the store and walked out 10-15 minutes later, fitted and with 2 new bras. like i said, i'm a very large cup size (i) and i purchased a sports bra and regular bra. for 2 bras i spent just under $140 but it is worth it to me. i can't walk into any store and just buy a bra because they don't fit. read the reviews like i did, but go give it a shot. i'm glad i went!"
5-star,1,"since most of these reviews are incredibly old, i decided to bite the bullet and go on a friend's advice to cc's. i went on a saturday and there was a woman working. she quickly measured me and asked me a handful of questions about the bra i was at the shop for. she helped get me into a bra and was very professional about making sure everything fit in right. she was good about answering any questions i had as well. in addition to a strapless bra, i bought a sports bra. while i paid a lot for them, they seem good quality. i was in and out of the store in about 15 minutes. that included a measurement, fitting on both bras to ensure they were comfortable and fit well. i wasn't pressured into more bras or accessories that i didn't need. the lady that helped me was professional and courteous (and super helpful with all my questions). i didn't feel rushed out of the store, either. they're just fast and good. i highly recommend this shop if you have an odd size or if you're a larger lady. i believe they have more normal sizes too, so stop by if you need a good bra. the location seems odd and slightly sketchy, but the shop was clean and they had a good stock of products. the lady who was working was really quick about finding bras, too, so they keep things organized well. if you do go to their website mrbra.com, it looks incredibly old, but most of what they had there is on the site as well if you like to order online."
1-star,0,"holy cr*p. i am still recovering from the experience. i wish i had read these reviews first. i was not prepared for cc. pushy, creepy, condescending...violating. how about asking before pulling up my shirt and undoing my bra?! no kidding, i felt like i avoided a molestation. i suppose i should put my big girl panties on and just bask in the service he's delivered ""since 1969"" but no, thank you. be very careful, girls, when you approach. i recommend bringing a bodyguard."
4-star,1,"have no fear! i took my mother to cc's today to find a mastectomy form bra. admittedly, when we drove up we were hesitant to go inside. (from the outside it looks a little seedy.) i actually quickly looked it up on yelp and we decided to give it a try. the young lady who was there to help us was wonderful and kind. she assured my mom and helped her to find a great bra at a reasonable price."
4-star,1,"the first time i walked into cc's was over twenty years ago and the original owner took one look at me and told me i was in the wrong bra and the announced what my real size was without evening measuring me; and he was correct. his son now runs the business and he provides an experience; you will not find fancy racks and displays of lingerie everywhere like you would in a typical retail store, but you will find a bra that fits. both the owner and his help have an interesting approach to customer service, but i enjoyed the direct, no bs service. in a world of phony customer service from people who just collect a paycheck, i found cc's to be quite refreshing. if you need a good bra that fits, support a local business and visit cc's."
1-star,0,since getting pregnant my chest size grew from a 34dd to a 34g. at first i was so happy to find a place i could actually try bras on instead of internet shopping. i was very uncomfortable with the owner from the beginning. as many women have mentioned he is creepy and arrogant. he walked in on me in the dressing room while trying on my last bra. the three times i visited the shop i dreaded the experience but felt that was my only option for finding this hard to fit bra size. after my last visit i went on a search for another place that sells my size and found nordstrom in scottsdale's fashion square they were not only less expensive but a pleasant and comfortable experience.
1-star,0,"had problems with the bras that i bought (2 for 180 dollars). went back one week later the owner was red-faced and angry, my friend wanted to call the police because he took his hands and fingers and put them down my not-low-cut top and told me that i was wearing my bra for ""play"" and it wasn't meant for ""play"". he yelled at me, got in my face and told me that i wanted my bra low-cut and that's what i get... i meant to write this re-review earlier but just don't even want to think about the entire situation. honestly, i am a survivor, i don't need that shit."
1-star,0,"read great things about this place, and stopped by to take a look. i've driven past this place a million times and kept going. i've stood outside this place at least a few times, hands clenched, determined to go in. i've been to some seedy places before, but this place always freaked me out. it has to be better on the inside, right? nope. there is no stock on the floor to shop, so you better commit when you walk through the door. the man working there (presumably the owner?) may in fact be very skilled, but he was also pushy, abrupt and even a little bit condescending. the service and product at cc's may be the best the valley has to offer, but i can't get past all the jarring elements of my experience. :( it is not worth it for me."
4-star,1,"warning guys - this is girl talk. if you have one of those dresses and/or outfits that is almost impossible to wear a bra with, you have an impossible to find size, you feel you're starting to lose the fight against gravity, or if you'd like it to look like, well... like your pillows are extra fluffed - this is an awesome spot for you. this isn't victoria's secret by any leaps and bounds. there will be no lotions or silk pillows. it's all about lift and separate. well, they have lingerie of all kinds, but i've only gone for the bras. these things are awesome. i originally went for a particular dress, but let me tell you. i made a trip there not long ago and, well, take that gravity! and the prices may be a bit more than victoria's secret - but these things are going to last forever. when you walk in, you might think you came to the wrong place because it's a small shop, parking can suck if anyone else is there, and when you first go in it almost just looks like a dry cleaners or something. all business. great place to be fitted and know what a real bra should feel like. nothing against many other places, but sometimes they are more worried about pretty than functional. while pretty is important, it's not the whole enchilada. and as i believe comics have said before me, no one is going to see a hot girl, take her home but then stop because her bra wasn't pretty enough - if ya know what i mean. the folks are always super nice but most important they are very professional. expect them to want to see how it looks on ya - but know that you'll be getting honest opinions about fit and size in a way that your friends just can't give. totally worth it."
5-star,1,"this store is clean and easy to shop in. if your an asu fan, this is the place to be. the staff is happy to help you find what ever you need. prices are fair and i love the items from baby outfits to adult attire, to great small gifts inbetween. i hate to call it a hole in the wall, just because it's small. this store is cleaner than most name brand shops and it's a local store that i love to support! thanks for making shopping for asu gear fun and exciting!!!"
5-star,1,"all the employees are friendly, outgoing, and attentive ! the owner and his wife are there nearly all the time trying to better their business and making friends with just about everyone within a mile radius ! i hear they are opening up a new store and cannot wait to go see the cool spot ! much better merch than most places i see and always at a fair price. i will be going back for sure. it's where i get all my gifts. sweet and simple choices !"
5-star,1,"i live in ca but travel to az quite often for games. the owner worked with me on some special orders to ensure we could pick them up on game day when we arrived in town. i have been in the store a dozen times to pick up asu gear. they have a wonderful staff, a great selection and decent prices. the best part? the store is owned and operated by an asu alum. this is my go to spot for any and all asu gear purchases."
4-star,1,"the people that work here are always very friendly and helpful. it's a pretty small place, but they have a good selection of asu stuff at decent prices. great items always on sale. i got my dad a nice asu dad t-shirt for about $15 and a cute blouse for myself for 40% off. 2 hour free parking is available just north of this location in n open parking lot from 6 or 8 am - 6pm, i think monday through friday. sorry, i've forgotten the exact days and start time. they also currently have stuff for the teams playing in the insight bowl."
4-star,1,"it was a hard decision to give this place a 4 vs a 5. sg and i are a's fans. this place sells itself during spring training as a place to get all your spring training shirts and hats and stuff. but, they do not have any a's hats and almost no a's shirts. come on guys, get some more a's stuff!!!!! they do have a great selection of asu stuff for the locals and some really neat designs from the other teams that come down to spring training, hence the 4*. the owner, who is present in the shop, is very nice and very attentive to customers. the other staff are also very helpful. they have some great deals and some killer sales, so as long as you are not an a's fan, you will likely find just what you want!!!"
5-star,1,"these guys are legit. their team of associates are all professionals...and not just in their business, as runners (triathletes). i have issues with planter fasciitis, surgically repaired achilles tendon, and toenails missing/filling with blood. recently increased shoe size and type of shoe. from another company's suggestion. nope! worked with matt. he asked simple questions, then walked to the back pulled out a pair shoes... had me do a light jog... and said, these are the shoes you need. yup! my first run yesterday, total game changer! for any running questions or needs this is where you want to be. thanks cadence team... (hope dan dominated boulder ironman!)"
5-star,1,one of the best stores around! the employees are all top notch athletes who can get you in the shoes you need for your feet. they are very knowledgable and patient to help you find what you need in a shoe! check out their weekly group runs
5-star,1,"i love this store! i purchased some altras around six months ago, and the rubber on the bottom started to peel away. these are pricey shoes, so i took them back to see if they had some glue on hand to fix them. they didn't, but they did fit me with a new pair and told me they would send the old pair back to altra to make sure they knew of the defect. what amazing customer service, this is why i will always go back to cadence."
5-star,1,i just bought a new pair of running shoes from these guys! they were so polite especially since i had a toddler in tow. mom life can be hard for personal hobbies so buying a new pair of running shoes is a huge deal to me!!!! love love my shoes can't wait for tomorrow's run! thanks for listening to my shoe requirements and finding the perfect fit all while giving wonderful customer service. this is my new go to running store!
5-star,1,"these guys are fantastic! they do much more than sell sports shoes, they analyze what your footwear needs are and truly work to find the best shoe for you."
5-star,1,i went to cadence since they were the only place in the valley that had the altra shoes i was looking for. i was blown away by the customer service i received. the employees were super knowledgeable and friendly and addressed all my very specific questions. they have the largest selection of altras of any store i've been. i will absolutely go back!
5-star,1,"beyond helpful and informative! lindsay was very personable and helped us find the right shoe for our needs. my needs have changed since i was told that i over probate 13 years ago. i'm now a neutral shoe. who knows how long i've been wearing the wrong type of stability shoe?! i'm so glad we found this place, and i don't think i'll be able to shop for my running shoes anyplace else because of the awesome service i received here."
5-star,1,"this place is fantastic. they are attentive and knowledgeable. it will take an hour for them to find the right shoe for you, but in the end your feet will thank you."
5-star,1,"i have put on some weight and need to get in shape but my old beloved tennis shoes are shot :( so i began my search for a new pair of tennis shoes that i am comfortable in and dont hurt my feet. ( i am not a runner but i been able to walk 3 miles but my feet swell up real bad at 1 and 1/2 mile. thru recommendations i brought an expensive pair of new balance, worst decision ever -my feet sooo sore and i stopped working out because i was frustated and didnt want the pain. talked to a friend who said keep at it --find another shoe --went to lots of average joe places couldnt find anything that felt comfortable. finally went on line for running shoe stores and found cadence among others and one day i was in the area and thought i would swing in -got there and thought crap this is a small runner store and i am not a runner -was gonna just turn around but lindsey came up to me right away and began asking quesions so i thought ok have an open mind she is sweet be nice lol -i explained about my last pair of shoes, she didnt put the brand dowm and asked if i heard about a new brand called altra (i think ) and i said no so she had me try them on -definetly felt way different than anything else i felt before, kind of weird and she explained why they felt weird and i wasnt quite sold on the weird feel-then told her about my problem spots that i experience when walking and she brought out several different shoes without caring about ""brand"" (although i did mention i like saucony and was told to get brooks-people are very loyal to their ""brands"" of shoes they use -lol) i had the brooks all picked out but wanted to try one more pair i just wasnt that confident about actually pulling the plug and buying them and then be frustated again and i explained why i was not quite confident in that shoe and lindsey had another pair for me -winner! i feel in love with them and was excited and said sold but they dont look like workout shoes i told her they look like my son's cool shoes he wears -not that i care about style but was suprised it was not the basis look of a ""running shoe"" it looks more like an everyday tennis shoe. now i want to put these shoes on everyday and want to go walking again and that was huge for me! thanks for making me feel comfortable lindsey and not awakard being in ""runner store with my fat butt"" !!! it made a huge difference in my comfort level. also want to mention three other things i really liked-1 she actually told me to go walk around outside the store -what???? just walk outside with these shoes on outside before i buy and it is ok lol i really liked that because i was able to feel what it was like walking around on the pavement and walk farther to get a real feel, 2 i still may come back for brooks to switch up shoes for different walking trails and she kindly gave me the information so i could come back (some places are like no we will keep it on file and tell you when you come back) so i really liked that and 3 she told me about their tuesday group run and i was like you know i dont run and she was like no problem then walk which made me feel included and again not stupid for not being a runner :) so glad i took a chance on this ""runner store"" -no matter what activity you do or just need comfortable shoes it is worth it especially as i am getting older i need the comfort -:)"
5-star,1,"terrific service! we came here after my nephew's track meet because he lost a couple of his track shoe spikes. the employee was very kind and screwed brand new ones for only 75 cents! he also gave us he heads up that when you buy shoes here, they make sure you get the perfect shoe based on fit and even let you test them. store is very organized and sells great products. will come back next time we buy running shoes for sure. love supporting local businesses!"
5-star,1,"matt and lindsay were so great to my wife and i. i called first after being recommended to them by a friend who is an avid runner. lindsay was very helpful over the phone and it really confirmed my decision to go in for a consult. my wife and have recently started becoming much more active but were both suffering from nagging injuries and getting really frustrated. especially because we got fitted a large retailer that charged us a fortune for shoes and inserts that didn't end up helping. matt and lindsay could see right away what my wife and i needed by looking at our feet, how we stood, how we walked, and how we looked taking a quick jog. they recommend several shoes for us to try on to see what fit we preferred and gave us some great tips and resources on improving our running form. their pricing was also great. very comparable to amazon but at cadence you can actually try on the shoes and get some experts to fit you. lindsay also told us about a fun community run they put on every tuesday. our experience was terrific and i look forward to giving them our business in the future."
5-star,1,these guys are real pros. they absolutely know their stuff. they'll have you walk back-and-forth for quite some time and recommend a shoe which will fit right based on your gait. i've been to physical therapist and podiatrists. on four different occasions i've ordered orthotics. the pros at cadence have knowledge superior to these medical professionals when it comes to shoes.
5-star,1,amazing service. helped my wife find the perfect shoe that fit her running style. tried an many different shoes and with out asking they pulled shoes from their 40% sale on last years model. they never tried to up sale - it shows that they care about customer service and the love for the sport.
5-star,1,always a great experience when i go in for new shoes. staff is always friendly and very knowledgeable when it comes to fitting you for the right shoe. i highly recommend cadence running co.
5-star,1,"great little store with nice staff that are serious runners, meaning they know the gear. :) good merchandise and everything you expect a specialty store to have."
5-star,1,these guys are great. i have weird feet and i came in to get an assessment. lindsey made a great recommendation for my funky gait but i was stubborn and went for the cooler looking shoe. i should have listened because the ones i picked hurt my calfs. i brought them back in and they made an exchange for the original recommendation with no issue. my wife ended up buying a pair for training for a tough muddier as well. highly recommend this place if you need shoes for running or training!
5-star,1,"amazing service! looked at my feet, i was running in a size way to small for me, and found the perfect shoe. i'll never go anywhere else for running shoes."
5-star,1,"this place is amazing! we were sent here on the recommendation of a friend because i've had a lot of problems with my feet lately, and even though the guy that helped us was the only one there and multitasking between several customers, i still felt like he was addressing my individual needs perfectly. when we first got there he asked a ton of questions about what had been hurting me, how long, what shoes was i wearing, etc. he gave some suggestions and got me in a pair of shoes. he had me walk around in them and then watched me run in them and put me in several different pairs and repeated the same process, asking what i thought about them and giving recommendations each time. so helpful! the root of the problem was something that hadnt ever been suggested to me before so hopefully he's right and my feet will be better now. overall i thought he was very professional and obviously knowledgeable. will be coming back here next time i or anyone else in my family need shoes."
5-star,1,"went in for for a shoe recommendation and was very happy with the advice. the staff checked my stride and suggested four different shoes. also discovered i wasn't stretching enough and it was affecting my form. if your serious about running, skip the warehouse sports store and stop by cadence."
5-star,1,"how can anyone not give this place 5 stars? my husband and i were first time customers and we both left extremely satisfied. the guy who helped us was knowledgeable, friendly, and most importantly...he listened to us! we never felt hassled or rushed and the amount of indivualized attention they seem to give each customer is hard to find nowadays. great shop!"
1-star,0,"snarky, obnoxious, ""know-it-all"" sales staff who get angry when customers ask follow up questions or disagree with their recommendations. limited product lines and inventory. if you enjoy being talked down to and made to feel stupid, this is your store. otherwise, don't waste your time or money on this place. go to roadrunner in tempe. you can even get more knowledgeable, friendlier and better customer service at sports chalet or dick's."
5-star,1,"i moved to gilbert from new mexico, where i had a running shoe store analyze my gait and help me find some shoes to eliminate some stress on my extremely arthritic knees. i have been managing to buy the exact same model every 6 months on amazon for the past 3 years but now it is not available. after reading the reviews from yelp, i called the store to ask if all of the employees were trained to fit shoes and did they only work arthritis sufferers. the man that answered the phone said that at least 1/2 of the customers never ran in their lives and all employees were trained. i went in and the lady that helped me recommended some new asics gel-cumulus. my knee pain is much better. i had been wearing the nimbus but the last pair just didn't help the pain much she said that everyone should get fit for new shoes often due to body and foot changes. i did not feel uncomfortable at all. i will be back in another year or two for another shoe fit check. thank you."
5-star,1,"went into the store after my podiatrist suggested i contact them for a shoe that would help my planter fasciitis. todd helped me and was very patient and knowledgable about the shoes he sells including shapes, fit, arches etc... he brought out different styles and shoes for me to try and even went out into the parking lot with me to walk around in them. it makes no difference if you are not athletic or a runner this guy knows his stuff!! the shoes i bought have helped me so much and the sock to help with the planter fasciitis was also a great investment! i would not hesitate to go back and have been handing out cards to the store since i left!!"
1-star,0,the store has a really bad return policy. i would never shop there again. my shoe had a whole after 3 weeks. it was a $156 asics. i went to return it but dan told me it was my fault and they will not return it. i told them they were brand new and his suggestion was to put duct tape on it. really?? i told them that any other store would have returned these and they said we are not any other store and the manufacturer will not take it back. i called asics and they said each shoe had a two year manufacturer's warranty and they were surprised to learn that the shop would not honor this.i mailed it to asics and they took care of it. needless to say will never shop local again netter to deal with a department store!!!
5-star,1,"i started running a few months ago and found out that it is important to get the right shoe for you. i went to dick's sporting goods and sport chalet and they gave me totally different suggestions. sport chalet guy was dead wrong even though he used a treadmill and a camera. the guy at dick's made sense and i was going to go with their recommendation and then i found out about this place. i really like how matt took his time, explained everything and brought out various shoes for me to try. i was hesitant to go in the parking lot with these new shoes on when i knew i wasn't sure which one would i buy! but they are totally ok with that. this is how they sell their shoes. they want to make sure that you are comfortable running in them on the road and not just walking on the carpet. i tried three pairs and did not buy a single one that day. he was totally ok with that. i went back couple days later and got my brooks ghost 6 and i love them!! if you are serious about running, give this place a try!"
5-star,1,"excellent, excellent, excellent! i had limited time to shop and really needed to get some new shoes. dan understood that, looked at the worn out pair i was wearing and immediately could tell i was incorrectly placed into shoes that were all wrong for me. a dear friend accompanied me and could see the same thing and she wound up with a nice new pair for herself, too! i did not feel pressured to buy insoles and socks and vip programs just to get additional discounts, nor was i roped into buying the most expensive shoes available. instead, dan asked what my application was (mostly gym, cross-training, running intervals) and he got my feet happy within 15 minutes. i wore my new shoes home and once i finished some errands, i promptly gave them a go with a short run in my neighborhood. first time in years without knee or foot pain and i felt like i had a real ""spring in my step"" while running in a great pair of newtons, a brand with which i had never been familiar. hubby will be heading there this weekend to get his new shoes! thanks, dan!!"
5-star,1,just stopped in and got a pair of shoes. they took their time and really helped get me into the right pair of shoes. the didn't up sell me on something i did not need. overall a great experience. i recommend it to anyone needing a pair of running shoes.
5-star,1,"the staff is incredibly helpful in finding the right shoe for you and they have a 10% military discount. it's a small store, but they offer a good variety of merchandise. i love my asics!!!"
5-star,1,"dan and matt are the best in the business. dan has been running since college and still runs several races and triathlons each year. matt has also been running forever and these two know everything about wearing the right shoe. if your kid just joined track for the first time, you haven't run in years and want to start again, or have never run and got suckered into a race, or think you know everything about running these guys will not disappoint, don't believe me, just ask some of the olympic athletes that shop there. they can watch you take a few steps and just stand in your socks and can tell you what is the best type of shoe, after that it is just a matter of which one you like or feels the best. these guys and their customers are a wealth of knowledge. i learn something new every time i go in there!"
5-star,1,"if you're new to running or want to get more serious about your running, this is the place to get outfitted. dan has been in the business for many years and has a wealth of knowledge about anything running and triathlon related. best customer service and product knowledge. get in here and get running!"
1-star,0,"the customer service was very poor!!! i bought a pair of shoes online as a surprise gift for my husband. they don't have a pick up option online so i called them to let them know that i'll just pick it up at the store. they told me just to go at the yorkville location and pick it up. i told my husband that i have to pick up something for myself. we drove all the way from north york to downtown, and the guy told me that i have to show him my id coz they have to photocopy it with the visa that i've used online. unfortunately, i didn't bring any id's with me that time just the visa that i've used and the confirmation email that they sent me online. i was like in shock when they told me that. they said it's for security purposes. but wth, the guy on the fone didn't mention bringing any id's. if the guy on the fone told me to bring id's then i could've brought one. anyways, the guy cancelled my order online and told me to just buy at the store. so i have to tell my husband the situation, and i have to tell my husband i bought shoes for him. surprise ruined!"
5-star,1,overall a pretty good store if you are looking for sneakers in the yorkville area. a lot of things were sold out in my size but i guess that comes with shoes being limited. girl working at the shoes store was polite and helpful. they are also starting to carry women's footwear as well so overall a pretty good spot for sneakers
1-star,0,"capsule is definitely the worst sneaker store in and around toronto period. if your down to play into the hypebeast then this place is for you, everyone else look elsewhere to satisfy your sneaker desires. if your going to call your self a sneaker boutique, the least you guys could do is actually carry the standard range of mens shoe sizes 8-13. the fact that you guys consistently never carry size 13 in your biggest brands (asics, new balance, nike) makes your ""boutique"" a complete joke. i have asked in the past why they don't carry size 13's and have been told that ""our suppliers usually don't have any size 13's for the canadian market, so if they are unavailable, we cannot get them"". other sneaker shops in toronto don't seem to have the same difficulty in getting size 13's which must mean capsule gets the end of the line selections, or they stash away the size 13's before they hit the shelves if you want to buy sneakers in toronto, i would check out: solestop, livestock, svp, groovy and ugly duckling (all except for ugly duckling located at yonge and dundas and solestop located in pacific mall) are located within a few blocks of the queen and spadina intersections) before making your way to the over hyped capsule ""sneakerless"" boutique."
1-star,0,"capsule has been a staple shop in the toronto street wear scene for many years. they carry a great number of classic street wear brands at standard canadian retail prices as well as a few less-well-known brands. however, their problem isn't pricing or brand selection, it's sizing and employee attitude. as other reviewers have stated, they rarely, if ever, have a size 13 in any shoe from any company. they carry nothing above an xl in any t-shirt/sweatshirt/top and the same goes for their selection of pants/bottoms. i understand that they cater to their customer base and what sells, however i am 6' 2"" and a big guy, many sneaker-heads and street wear aficionado's i know are well above a size xl in all clothes and most wear size 12 and up. i'm not expecting all sizes in every shoe from every manufacturer, but when the same shoes are available at livestock or groovy in size 13 and even size 14 on occasion, it makes you wonder what is really going on. this store is for people caught up in the hype. i suggest letting the 905-ers that make up the bulk of their saturday sneaker release lines take the bait and local torontonians shop elsewhere for their kicks and threads."
5-star,1,dope shop for those who like streatwear. really small shop on the lower level kinda hard to find if your not looking for it. one of the remaining sneaker stores left in the city. they carry good brands stussy is pry the best. new bounce heat is also sold here and nikes of course. what sets it apart is the service. the guy knows what he's talking about and is happy to have a conversation with you. talked to him for hours. he told me the history of the stores here owners how they opened ect. great place worth the visit just to check it out. great environment 5 stars unlike the other toronto stores.
1-star,0,"horrible customer service. i had walked in and was looking around, the girl at the counter asked if i had been fitted at the store, which i hadn't. but i have been fitted at other stores that cater to a wide range of bra sizes and i told her my size. she said to me in a very dismissive almost insulting tone that the size i told her 'means absolutely nothing here'. no further explanation as to why it means nothing. i understand that fit sometimes fluctuates based on different styles and designs but to not even acknowledge what i was saying and act so arrogantly, that's not exactly what i call customer service. definitely will not be going back, there are lots of other places in toronto that actually provide good customer service."
2-star,0,if you know bras these are definitely subpar! went with my mom and she got 2 and i got one. hers broke after 2 wears and mine looks like it has been through war even though i take really good care of my bras. let's not even talk about the fact that they get loose and don't fit properly after a couple of wears. definitely not worth the money.
5-star,1,"a friend and colleague of mine recently told me all about her favourite bra store. i nodded along and knew this sounded like a good sitch for me, but didn't think i'd actually ever make it in. good in theory, never actually feeling like trying on bars in practice. y'know? then i heard about their current sale... buy three bras, get two free. nice, properly fitted bras. yes, i spent a little over $300 there today, but i left with five bras that will last me a couple of years. all of the wins. the staff were kind, not pushy, and when helping with sizes they didn't make you feel molested. five star boob day over here."
4-star,1,"came here a few days ago completely coincidentally and really liked the store and products. got fitted by renée (hope i've spelled your name correctly) who was absolutely wonderful, super efficient, and really friendly."
1-star,0,"i just wanted to drop by and get a present for my significant other. called first and mentioned the size i need... they confirmed they had them. so i walked in. started browsing. 5min... 10min... completely ignored. finally a harried sales girl comes by and asks if i need anything. i said yes, and then she vanished again. two other ladies walked into the store after me, and they got helped right away. i walked around for 5 more minutes and after still not getting any assistance walked out. so this store totally ignores guys walking in. atrocious service. even if the prices are ok, this complete disregard for common courtesy isn't worth the monetary savings. if i could give them a 0 rating i would.stores like this do not deserve to stay in business. walked into an adjacent store, kallome intimates, got greeted right away and got great customer service by multiple sales reps."
5-star,1,my canadian cousin has been raving that this place would change my life. she was more than correct. the fitting room gal sized me up and found me the perfect fit. it was a pleasant experience and she handled my unruly chest with confidence. i'm beyond pleased and wish this place existed in the states. i'll be back!!
2-star,0,"i went in to find some bras, after having luck at the change in my hometown. the bras the sales lady gave me to try on we're the worst fit ever. the underwire was nowhere near my chest, the fabric was gapey - no good. she said it was a great fit but luckily i knew better and left. this store gets 2 stars because they were open on a sunday, the staff was polite and they ended up pointing me to another lingerie store down the street that was far superior."
5-star,1,"i went to change for a change - i'm really sick and tired of expensive bras that are uncomfortable and don't fit. pinching, poking underwires, fabric that's too stretchy in some areas, too tight in others, ""double boob"", ""back boob"" and all of the other fun symptoms of poor fitting bras. ladies, i'm sure you know what i mean if you're also wearing these female torture devices. as soon as i walked into the store i was greeted by one of the employees behind the front counter, and welcomed into the store (check). she asked me if i had been to change before, and when i said no, suggested a proper fitting (check). once she had taken all of my measurements, she allowed me to stay in the fitting room and brought all of the sizes and styles to me (check), adjusting her selections to my preferences as we moved along. the result, a perfectly sized breast holster which doesn't pinch, and won't bulge in all of the wrong places. bonus: with 'european sizing', i left feeling like i have dolly parton sized boobs. it turned out that they had a great special on in the store (buy 2, get 1 free), so i left with 3 sets (holsters + undergarments) for $180. realistically, this is no more (maybe less) expensive than victoria secret, but i have higher quality, properly fitted bras (check). as i checked out, i was offered enrollement into the change loyalty program so that my size is saved, and i'll probably get emails for future specials, deals and events in the store (check). also, for the guys - if your lady is enrolled, you can easily go lingerie shopping for her, and they will have her size on file. a great experience overall, and i will definitely go back."
5-star,1,"a friend of mine is on change's email list and invited me to shop their big sale with her at lunch today. it's been a while since i've had a specialty bra store i really liked (my favourite closed in 2008 and i've been making do with department store brands since), so i was up for checking it out. and now i'm sold! there's no way i'm going back, especially not at these sale prices. (the more you buy, the more you save--i ended up buying two of the bra i liked best, partly so i'd always have one even if the staff is friendly, knowledgeable, and enthusiastic, and the quality of the bras on offer seems very good. they've got a wide range of sizes, which is great for those of us who wear a small band and large cup size."
4-star,1,the only thing i can buy there is their thongs. they are the most comfortable thongs i have ever owned. they don't give you a wedgie! ha! their bras are european sizes so nothing fits me there. online they have larger sizes but i don't buy online. the staff are very nice. the store is well kept.
4-star,1,"the store is small but it has great lighting and the bras are all neatly displayed out. i went in and i had to awkwardly wait a few minutes until the sales girl acknowledged me, but she was very helpful. maybe she was tired? she could tell my cup size just by looking at me and brought out all these bras to try on and they were great. i've got an awkward figure but the bras were nice and i was really happy with the ones i chose. however, i did notice a small rip in one the bras when i took it home so make sure to completely check the bras and take your time. in the changing room, i overheard all the other sales girl helping other people and they were all friendly and nice. when i went to purchase them, i realized i forgot my credit card but i was still able to buy them as i just called home for the number. it's strange though because on the original receipt the total was 134 but on the small bill stapled on top, it says 143. i called and they said come in and we'll check it out but it's a far trip so whatever. they were having a sale so i got two bras and then one free but i still ending up spending a lot! it's so unfair that the bigger bras cost more, but their prices are about the same as a department store and waaaaay less than those boutique ones so i gotta deal. they actually had a strapless bra for my size but it was $90 so i didn't buy it :p i'll definitely be coming back for some more bras. i want to try their sport ones. bra shopping use to make me so depressed but now i'm excited for my next purchase!"
4-star,1,"i came here one year ago i guess. i looked for a bathing suit at that time. the sale person was friendly and gave me good recommend. i wish there were more variety of bras. anyway, i would check it out again.."
5-star,1,"normally when i tell a salesperson my size (large cup, small band), she giggles nervously and suggests some store down the street... first time i saw a change store, i walked in, proffered my size, and waited for the nervous titter. instead, i got ""sure!"" and shown the most amazing collection of nice looking samples in real-woman sizes. i was there at the end of a month-long sale so they had a limited number in my size. ""only"" 11. most larger bras resemble those leather slings on the front of cars - ""car bras."" change's stuff is all nice-looking (though i'd stay away from the embroidered, the patterns show through thinner shirts). today i brought a family friend, a large-chested teen who never had a good bra, in. i introduced her with ""i've been telling this lady about this new fad, where bras actually fit..."" they whisked her into a room, did a proper fit, showed her how to try them on properly (no one but change -ever- does that), and brought her bra after bra. she narrowed it down to two, but could have picked up half a dozen and still left a good few behind. she then went home and facebook'ed about the new experience of having a bra that fit. so. - wide range of sizes, from the very large to the very small, including most of the odd sizes few companies bother with. - well-fitting - both lined and unlined bras. - a good selection of colours and patterns, as well as standard black, white & nude (covering most people's tastes). - a frequent buyer club that means all your purchases are at least 10 per cent off. - frequent sales, from buy one, get one half off to 50-70 per cent off everything in the store. their regular prices are a little higher than some, but in three years, i've never paid full-price for anything there."
3-star,0,"change is a bra shop that's been open for about 5 years on queen west, but due to the lack of need for a lot of basic t shirt bras, i never walked through the doors. the biggest bit of advice would be to improve the display in the front- make it more obvious what the real draw here is. i was told about the range of sizes from a tiny but generous friend- girls, you know what i mean? she ended up with some ridiculous size that i've never heard of. so, today, i walked in and guess what? i, too, walked out with a ridiculous size. i've always known most women walk around with an ill-fitting bra. ladies, this place is great at finding at least one soutien-gorge that will fit. but, you might not get the exact style you wanted, or the color, or the size you think you want. so, hurray for change, but be prepared to compromise. after wearing it around for a day, my friend asked me why i'm squeeky like poutine cheese. it's my new bra, i'm not 100% on the fit nor the material its made of. oh well, better luck next size."
5-star,1,for gals like myself that are blessed in their upper region.. this is the place to go! the sales associates are so nice! they are going to actually size you right and make sure you leave happy!! goodbye ill fitting bras and hello happy chest heaven! my girls are so happy for their lingerie!
4-star,1,"i've been to this store several times now and have always received good service. they carry a wide range of sizes and have both a good selection of basics and fashion bras. occasionally the quality of the bras can be hit or miss. change sometimes uses scratchy laces and threads, so it is really important that you run your fingers over every part of the bra to make sure it is smooth and soft. i have bought a few bras without doing this and ended up only wearing them once or twice before i got rid of them - but the bras i have checked over carefully in store have ended up being the bras i wear the most. be careful when shopping here (take your time!) and you will end up with properly fitting bras that you love."
5-star,1,"at first when the sales girl guessed me at a 28g i was rather offended, mortified and heart-broken. i wanted to be a c darn it. but man, did i switch my tune after she took me back to the change room to properly measure me and show me the difference a properly fitting bra makes. two years later i am a devotee and rave the blessings that change has bestowed upon me, my mom, my grandma, and my friends. so many lingerie stores cater to the ""typical"" sizes, y'know anything in a rib size 32-36, and in cups from a-d. but as with most concepts of what ""typical"" is in the fashion industry, this is of course completely wrong. most of us seem to be going about with ill-fitting undergarments that don't flatter us in the least. but here it is heaven. whatever size you are, they got it or they will get it. i can actually buy cute bras here and i don't have spillage or look gigantic from super-molded cups that seem so popular these days. they even carry swimwear, which for busty girls is awesome. no way am i tossing on a suit that doesn't have some support. my girly lumps need a lift and some restraint so they don't go bobbing about everywhere when i try to do anything remotely fun on the beach. thank you change and all the staff for making women's lives better, one undergarment at a time. xo"
5-star,1,"love this place. i originally went in looking for a sports bra, but ended up coming out with the much cuter sister, the demi bra! i was instantly put at ease by the girls who worked there, and was asked if i'd like a measurement - yes yes yes! who the hell knew i'm a massive d cup, baby! and 32 around! i've been wearing my bra size ass-backwards for years and years ... here i thought i was a 38b! the pricing isn't what i'd consider cheap, compared to la senza. but the quality is by far superior. all of the undergarments are soft, lush & feel much more substantial than the usual 'buy 3, get 1 free"" bras. it was also nice to see they had a full range of sizes - including plus sizes. i also don't feel like i should have my legs wrapped around a pole wearing these bra & thong sets. i'm over the days of cheap looking sequin bras, and appreciate a more simplistic, romantic feel everything in the store has."
5-star,1,"after having two babes and a combined two and a half years of breast feeding (yes ladies, your boobs will get softer and seemingly droopy after all of this, it's true), i have finally found what so few women do. a fantastically fit bra! who needs breast surgery when you have the perfect bra? la senza is the pits when it comes to fit; secrets from your sister was a difficult experience for me from fit to their professionalism on a few occasions but change, wow i absolutely love these guys. while the styles all sit differently i have found one to knock 'em dead. i now feel a lot more confident in my self and appearance and didn't realize it wasn't there to begin with until i had the tight bra. oh, and the staff are whip it, on it and non judgmental. you guys rock, so glad you are there :)"
5-star,1,"rude awakening. that is what i had... and it's bloody fantastic! perhaps some men might read this and think ""what's the big deal? sure, women look sexy in lacy underwear and bras. no need to have a parade about it."" well sir.... shaddup! what makes this place stand out? a) the staff is very helpful, friendly and knowledgable (i learned a lot about what to look for in a bra). b) moreso, it's not just a ""how does that feel? let me know if you need anything. see you at the counter."" these ladies know the value of a good-fitting bra. considering i [apparently] didn't know any better, racquelle would make suggestions and come back with more sizes to ensure i left as a completely satisfied and fully supported customer. c) they offer italian macaroons in the fitting room d) they offer more than your standard a, b and cs for me, there is no need to look any further to replenish my clearly tiny bra collection - and not just because most other bra stores don't carry anything higher than dd. this shop is a welcoming place with a staff that doesn't judge... they understand."
5-star,1,i love these bras. such a great fit. secrets from your sister carries some of their stuff and then they opened an entire store which is wonderful. good lingerie is an investment!
1-star,0,"i was really excited to visit this store given the good reviews on yelp, but was hugely disappointed by clothes that appeared dirty, very used and made of poor quality. i also don't understand what could possibly justify the high markup on their items. i suggest purchasing consignment from ebay instead."
4-star,1,"love it. lives up to the hype imo. i was suspicious because you never know, you know? i know. stopped here while perusing pretty much every vintage shop in the plateau/mile end area. i wish they had a larger selection, but their stuff is pretty unique and fairly priced. aside from your general vintage fare, they also have a variety of re-worked items- which actually are super cute and cool ( you know how sometimes vintage spots ~modify~ dresses by just like, taking out the shoulder pads and then charging $50? it wasn't like that). also they had hilarious lil tchotchkes (i hate that word but it seemed most appropriate) such as a lighter with an image of kanye making out with himself (best believe i bought it) and postcards adorned with old pics of celine dion herself with phrases like ""kiss my ass"" underneath (also bought those, obviously) cashier was a very stylish and pretty and friendly girl, naturally. will def come back!"
4-star,1,"let's be honest... i hate sorting through crap at vintage shops. citizen vintage is curated. the owner has a point of view and picks the clothes accordingly. thank you. and so, you can definitely expect to find something cool. less of a hunt. some pieces are modified as well and there are a few products from local designers. a+. 4 because it can be a bit pricey for what you are buying. it is second hand, not true vintage, after all."
5-star,1,"this place is truly a find, and it was hard for me not to spend all my money here on vacation. i tried on almost every dress they had and a few pairs of shorts and ended up buying a pair of shorts and a really pretty dress. it's a bit pricier but they do tailor many of the items themselves. overall, i liked it a lot here and would definitely come back (especially if i had a higher paying job ;). they also gave me a 15% student discount!"
4-star,1,"citizen vintage is yet another great little vintage shop in mile end. you'd think at some point they'd hit saturation and it would no longer be fun to look in them. you'd think that, but then guess what? you'd be really wrong. citizen vintage has a smaller selection than some of the bigger vintage shops and has some great consignment pieces too. they also have a great selection of sizes which is nice. the woman working in the store was really lovely and told us a bit more about some of the more unique items and suggested some other places to visit in montreal."
4-star,1,"everyone likes a good vintage store. it's like having a personal shopper bring the best digging to one place and pre-cleaning the goodies. the comparison is especially accurate in the case of citizen vintage. the three girls who own it started channeling their vintage love by doing popup shops in various locations. they hand pick and steam everything themselves. in this high-volume-vintage-demand age, it is a relief. they have certainly picked the ultimate location in this case, a wide and widely lit ex-antique furniture store, now showcasing colourful and quality embellishments for both men and women. it has adopted the hang-by-colour type of display design that a lot of stores seem to cherish these days and which is very pleasing to the eye. the shoe bazaar is magnifique, especially the leopard creepers from hush puppy featured on their blog. a funny detail and a blink to store design: the school lockers where some miscellaneous olympics garments hang effortlessly... this is exactly what you want your vintage look to achieve."
4-star,1,"my first few days in montreal left me disillusioned by the many many thrift shops all around. i wanted to find a place with great picks and reasonable prices. citizen vintage fits this void as looking through stock, i could tell each piece was different and unique. there wasn't a clutter of random pieces. there was a consistent feel of comfortable, chic pieces at decent prices."
4-star,1,"super cute spacious shop in a great location right next to sparrow (which makes for a lovely brunch and shopping outing, or a shopping and drinks outing. or both! big day!) zero stress staff, cute quirky styles, looked to be mostly 80s and 90s garments in good shape priced around 20$-60$ but i think the fab ladies who own this place have some other tricks up their sleeves for future seasons (and by tricks i mean bags of clothes). notable: rows of great shoes, and a sizeable men's section."
5-star,1,"what a great edition to the growing number of vintage shops in mile end! as a vintage connoisseur, i was pleased to see just how much care citizen vintage puts in to selecting and presenting their wares. the staff are friendly, the prices are more than reasonable and the styles are always a cut above what you find in other places. will definitely be shopping there again!"
5-star,1,"fantastically designed and curated store for all your vintage needs in montreal. prices that really don't even belong on that street. super affordable, impeccable selection!"
5-star,1,"for my sons 21st birthday i wanted to make him a baseball jersey so i had seen this store for quite a while and decided to see if they could help me. from my first interaction with their staff everyone was extremely friendly and helpful. i was only ordering one jersey and they treated me like i was ordering enough for an entire league. they took my design for a logo, established date etc and made me an awesome button up jersey that looked professional and classic. i even was late to the party on ordering it and they still made sure i was able to have it in time, going as far as meeting me before they opened so i could get it before i went out of town. class all the way around and highly recommend using them for any of your baseball/softball/cool gift ideas. thanks again to the entire team for making my vision become a reality!!"
5-star,1,"these guys are fantastic. super friendly, helpful and informative. they even took care of my son's glove at no charge following a blowout. thank you cleats!"
5-star,1,stopped here while visiting from ohio. the workers were very nice and helpful. had to search but found some decent deals for our 3 baseball playing boys.
5-star,1,cleats is the best! our daughter pitches and we have exchanged 2 sets of mizuno metal cleats. both were coming apart at the seams and they happily replaced them each time. great friendly and knowledgeable staff! we buys all our softball gear from cleats!
4-star,1,"hey cleats you guys are great! thanks for having everything that we need for our 7 year old football player even though its not football season! what a concept, carry equipment even when its not in season! great idea. i think the other large chain athletic places ( sports authoricrap and dicksucks sporting goods) should take a que from you! thanks! 4.5 stars in my book...took away one little stare because you all didn't have the exact size we needed but had one close enough! and my kid is tiny so its not your fault i am sure!"
5-star,1,these guys have been great to me over the years. i've bought all my baseball equipment here and they've always supported our little league. good guys with good stuff.
5-star,1,"i love this store. they always have a good variety of items, most of which are only lightly worn and of good quality. so much cheaper than buying new! and more sustainable. of course they don't always have something that hits home for me, but the great part is, there is good turn-over so you're bound to find something next time. the fun is in the hunt! thanks."
5-star,1,"love,love,love this store they're not like your regular consignment shop they have clothes in size xs-xxxl. and so many in shoes and handbags .everything is in good to new shape"
5-star,1,"garments are clean. everything is hung by style, size and color. gorgeous handbags. nice fitting rooms. they offer to help you or hold things you've picked out to try on. they hang it all in the fitting room for you. they have a loyalty program too. this is like a full retail store with thrift shop prices! 5 stars and a smooch for it being next to a froyo shop."
2-star,0,"i stopped on to grab a few things for my work wardrobe. i am disappointed in the selection. i likely won't be back, however i do get that their selection is based on what they purchase from the public. i suppose disappointed was a strong word; more like underwhelmed. staff was ok. they have shoes and name brand purses. still selling about 200. nah. i'll pass;-)"
3-star,0,"nice and clean, a good place to shop and look around. my only complaint/suggestion is to come down on the price of the handbags. almost like paying retail...the prices on the bags are insane!"
1-star,0,"strike 3------- you're out! clothes mentor has always been hit or miss with me. i love a great bargain, i like to hunt down a great outfit for a fraction of the cost but i will avoid clothes mentor from now on and save the frustration. earlier i received a text for 20% off entire purchase, score, right? so before i make time and load the kids in the car i call just to get a gauge on their lululemon selection. the young lady who answered today basically said, ""i'm not sure.......i don't know.......you'll have to check the racks yourself."" it's a monday, it was noon and she could have easily just said something like, ""oh my gosh, we always have a great selection of lulu or similar brands! we don't hold an inventory of specific items but is there something in particular you had in mind and i can quickly browse?"" there's a huge difference in tone of voice and pure laziness. she just wanted me off the phone. sadly, this is not the first time the store has had complaints on lackadaisical employees and not my first time experiencing it. honestly, it was just the first time i decided to write about it. head on over to uptown cheapskate a 1.5 miles up the road!"
5-star,1,i can't believe what an amazing consignment store this is. the goods are neat and clean and celebrated name brands are abundant. if you want a high end handbag or high end workout clothes this is definitely the place to do! i have also resold some items here. they have many opportunities to get a discount on items and they will send 10% off to your phone. i am really enjoying my wardrobe now thanks to them. the girls that work her are helpful and sweet! don't miss out!
5-star,1,"this place is much better than many of the consignment shops i've been too. they gave me a decent price on some designer items i brought in, and i was happier than i've been in the past at other stores. their selection of clothes is more than decent, most of everything is designer and/or brand new or gently worn. the ladies behind the counter were super nice and quick to assist. their prices were a little higher than i've seen at other places but there are quality items that are worth it. i'll be going back to sell and shop."
5-star,1,"i am definitely a fan! they have plus-sized fashionable clothes. my daughter and i are over the moon. i found this place 2 months ago and have already been back several times. i also follow their instagram page and drove over there immediately after they posted a cute pair of shoes! love this place, makes bargain-shopping fun :)"
5-star,1,"i've been shopping at clothes mentor for the past year. i love it so much ! i love new clothes but hate the mall. all those hours of shopping, not finding anything most of the time and the prices are ridiculous. this store has a great variety of styles and brands and the prices beat the best sale rack you could find in a mall. jewelry, wallets, purses, they have everything. i almost don't want to share this! my wardrobe is huge now and didn't cost me an arm and a leg or take up an entire saturday. the girls are really helpful and friendly too. they know the store like the back of their hand. when i was in a hurry i just told one of them what i was looking for and they knew just where to find it. they offer their opinion when i need it. girls you know how it is when your shopping by yourself and your not sure how something looks! it's like shopping with your girlfriends"
2-star,0,"when i lived in virginia clothes mentor was my go to place to buy and sell. this was my normal experience at the virginia clothes mentor. 1 - turn in my clothes for consideration. 2 - shop/try on/watch stack of what i want to buy grow. 3 - receive $80 to $100 for clothes accepted. 4 - spend $80 to $100 on clothes. i was so excited to find a clothes mentor near me in arizona. sadly i have found nothing to buy. the prices are surprising high for a second hand store. they must give you more for the clothes you bring in? no, they give you less. customer service is beyond terrible! do not ask them to come out from behind that counter! ever! my friend was feeling faint and we asked for some water. blank stares from the girls behind the counter. luckily another customer had some water in her car and ran to get it. so you have one customer sitting on the floor with their head between their knees. the other 4 customers in the store tending to this customer's medical needs. employees? behind the counter talking to one another."
1-star,0,"so sad and conflicted!!!! never been here, or even heard of this store before tonight. i was really excited since it is in a great location for me. i really wanted to buy and sell here, because when i stepped in i easily saw 20 things i would purchase :( i desperately wish my experience would've been pleasant so this could be my new favorite store, instead i don't know if i'll ever come back. i was immediately approached by an associate, who asked if i wanted to sell, i said yes. then the lady stepped behind a register as if to help me, but no. she then informed that their buyer had gone home at 6pm and apparently no one else is allowed to buy. however, i could leave my clothes behind-huge liability, no way. and really??? invest in your employees! are they not worth training? is this some sort of control issue? it's really inconveniencing and doesn't make the employees look competent or professional. the associate also said that i can go over to a competitor and try to sell there instead!! hahaha what??? please train the employees! please. they are literally sending customers away! i calmly told the sales girl how disappointed i was, and how i wanted this to be my new go-to spot, but i don't see that happening. she shook her head all disgusted when i left, she even made sure i saw her do it when i got in my car. i feel like i can't come back simply on principle, incredibly flawed process and snotty workers. i really want to do business with clothes mentor! all that needs to happen is the buyer needs to stay until closing time, or more employees need to be trained on buying and customer service! seriously, ryan or amy, please reach out to me and tell me how this will change in the future and would give it another go."
5-star,1,"great experience first time selling no problems, lovely ladies helping me. so much to choose from the store is well keep and a pleasure to shop in. i will differently be a returning customer. thanks"
5-star,1,"there is so much to choose from! i was able to buy 15 items for $138, and most were ann taylor. there is no way i could have afforded a new wardrobe i can be this excited about for the money. the other reason i shop clothes mentor no matter what city i am in? choices! i needed a nice, classic pair of black shorts. i was able to try on 7 different high end brands in my size and was able to choose the one that was the best fit. amazing!"
5-star,1,the quality of the clothes is great and everything is priced fair! other consignment stores have clothes that are worn out looking and over-priced. this is by far the best quality consignment store i've been to.
2-star,0,"clothing for women sizes 2-8 is okay, however the for women sizes 10 and up is inferior at best. they do have an excellent selection of designer bags and wallets, but they could be priced at little better, as if you are an individual that shops special designer bag events you can get better prices. when it comes to selling clothing, i don't understand the ""method to their madness."" i would also expect the staff to present themselves more professionally. all in all this shop is sub-par."
5-star,1,i love their prices and selections on what they decided to buy. everyone who works there is very nice and friendly and i love to get a great deal on cute clothes! shannon who works there is so nice and i will go back because of her!
1-star,0,"was not greeted when i came in with my family, but other people were that were caucasian as we we're not. strong horrible scent couldn't enjoy looking around. everything was over priced for what it was. $130 for a 5 year old coach bag?! but i found and bought a cute bag for $10 the only that looked worth the money."
1-star,0,"yes, pathetic offering for new stuff that i brought in...the smell comes from the thai place next door. they will have to move to another location to get rid if smell."
5-star,1,"i've never purchased resale items. but, when they opened up and was featured on tv i had to check them out. i am really impressed with the quality, price, and selection. my daughter outgrew her hunter boots and i was hesitant to purchase a new pair because of fast she is growing. if someone boxed it up in a hunter shoe box, and gave it as a gift i would never thought it game from a resale establishment. i couldn't believe the inventory they have and the range of sizes. if you're looking for women's clothing, accessories, bags, and shoes....this is the place! they have a customer for life!"
5-star,1,"love this store! great selections at great prices and super friendly staff, always whilling to help. what more can you ask for!? by far overall best service i've received at a retail store."
1-star,0,i'm not sure how this place is still in business but they charge more than the lululemon outlet for items that are not new. i willing to pay more for better quality items but the cheapest pair of lululemon bottoms that they had for sale was $68. last years style. not awful condition but definitely thread worn tanks? $36. i'll stick with my sisters closet for realistic pricing they did have a nice selection of things but again the price is untouchable. also upon entering the smell of the perfume permeates everything. it smelled as if someone had gone around and smashed bottles of cheap perfume immediately before i came in.
1-star,0,this place is useless. 90 percent of the time no matter even if you give fresh unused clothes that are currently trending they don't seem to take it. each associate gives a different explanation. i have never had a good experience selling. and the smell inside sucks. when you come outta the store you are surely to get a headache.
4-star,1,"love buying and selling clothes here, they give a great, fair price for what is brought in and they have a huge selection of like new merchandise. my only complaint is the fragrant smell that permeates through everything. it's very strong and very difficult to remove from clothing and handbags. otherwise, i will always shop here for great deals!!"
5-star,1,what a great place! i come all the way from east mesa to get a great outfit. the prices are great and they always have new things coming in.
2-star,0,"this store always sprays very strong perfume. it is so bad that it is truly a health hazard, i have asthma and could not be in there for one minute, before going outdoors and using my inhaler-same thing happened last time i was there, this is very bad for the customers and the employees lungs, i have told them this but it does not change! i would suggest staying out of there"
4-star,1,"it was a fantastic sale friday from 5-7, all yellow tags up to $10, on sale $3. over $10 sale price only $5. what a sale, plenty to choose from, lots of yellow tags, quality items and clothing color & size coordinated. their were lots of folks who came out to the sale. we all had a joyous time, there were snacks and water and two drawings. the 7 0'clock drawing gave away a beautiful designer bag. everyone needs to visit this lightly used clothing & accessories store. the quality of all things is superb. i have been there several times, always leaving with great stuff! oh yeah ladies, they also have a large variety for the big girls like me. that makes me happy, happy, happy. ladies at your earliest convience, check out clothing mentor on ray rd., you'll love this store. you can also bring in you well maintained items for cash on the spot at anytime. information about me www. gofund.me/xwn2uc.com"
1-star,0,"this store is a joke! rejected never worn gucci, stuart weitzman, guess + other high end designer footwear & apparel. two young sales associates took less than 5 min to determine all they wanted was a pair of target wedges. don't waste your time!!"
2-star,0,"cute clothes at reasonable prices, but terrible and snooty sales associates. anyone who has ever worked retail knows it is second nature to ask a customer if they would like to start a fitting room or a simple gesture to better their shopping experience."
5-star,1,"clothes mentor is a womens resale store for all women sizes 0-26, petites and maternity. they sell better brand-name ""gently-used"" women's fashions and accessories. i am sooooo thankful this store is in our area. i've been able to update my wardrobe for fall for a fraction of the cost of other stores. one of the items i bought still had the tags on! have already referred two friends there and they scored as well. please note: i am plus sized. they are small so you can see that just about anyone can shop there! check out the website for some of the ""looks"" you can buy there - business and casual, smart and stylish apparel, shoes, purses and accessories. plus, if you bring items in, they pay you cash on-the-spot unlike a consignment shop, where you may wait weeks to receive payment. i've watched this process happen - it is seamless. i will bring my first items there this week and will review how it goes."
5-star,1,"whenever i am in madison i make a stop at contours. thanks goodness family and business get me there often enough to keep me stocked up! a custom bra fitting is life changing. it enhances your posture and shape and makes you look way more put together. i put it on the same level as eyebrows... ever see anyone who only does their own maintenance? a professional set of eyes is a must! since our bodies and our ""girls"" change like with only a few lbs of weight loss or gain a bra wardrobe is a good thing to have."
5-star,1,"had a bra that didn't work-- exchange policy was quick and easy. they took me back to the dressing room to find one that did work and i only paid the difference in price. thanks, contours!"
5-star,1,"i was hooked after my first visit. it was hard to find cute bras in bigger sizes, but they have them here with over 180 sizes. plus with the right size the wires don't bother me anymore."
3-star,0,"really between a two and three. i am an uncommon size and have never really owned a bra that fits properly. last year i decided i needed to be an adult and invest in something that fits. contours prides itself on being able to fit any body and they offer extremely personalized service. i stopped in on a whim one afternoon and they had space to accommodate me for a fitting. contours doesn't keep bra stock out on their main floor, so i highly recommend scheduling a fitting ahead of time to ensure you can be seen. you can't just browse and find your own size; after chatting with one of their fitters and being measured you'll be brought an array of items to try on. on the day you go, wear the bra that fits you best/you like the most, and prepare to spend a lot of time topless with a stranger. the booths are private, but the associate stays with you as you try things on and helps make sure you a) know how to put on a bra properly [aka not clipping it in the front and wrenching it around to put the clasp in the back], and b) are on the right hooks and strap length. for me it was kind of being like being at the doctor - it's their profession so it wasn't weird being half naked, but i definitely wasn't expecting it, either. my main issue is having bra bands that roll - it's uncomfortable and looks terrible under clothes. i expressed that to my consultant and her response was that every bra does that and it's just something all women have to deal with. this sent up red flags for me and i should have listened to my instincts, but i continued with the fitting. after several different brands and styles, i found one that felt good in the changing room and seemed to fit well - no gaps or pinches. it was about twice what i typically pay at a department store, but i decided that if it was actually going to fit it was worth it. i added a few more styles i liked to a wish list that they can keep at the store for you, and made my purchase. contours does have a unique return policy. this review is about a year overdue so it may have changed/i might be misremembering, but i believe returns are for store credit if unworn, and if worn they'll credit you 50% of what you paid toward the purchase of a new item. i'm not personally a huge fan of this, but i felt like it was clearly explained before i made my purchase. the policy is posted in the store, my consultant verbally said it, and when i checked out it was on my receipt and the person working the desk also asked if i understood the policy or had any questions. now, why am i not a fan? even though my purchase felt great in the store and great for about the first half hour i wore it later that week, the band rolled just like every other bra within an hour of putting it on. if i'm going to have the exact same issue as the bras i can find in a department store (and that i specifically brought up to my consultant in hopes of solving), i don't see the point in spending the extra dough. i hemmed and hawed about returning to try another bra, but i can't afford to keep buying style after style to see if they'll hold up. i guess i could try to hang around the store while wearing it for longer, but that seems like a weird thing to do. on a positive note, the bra did fit better overall, and if the band wouldn't have rolled i would have been extremely happy with my purchase. so, very long story short: if you don't have a lot of issues with bras this is a great place to find extended sizes and custom service; if you have major fit issues on a small budget think carefully before making a purchase since you won't be able to return or exchange for the amount you paid."
5-star,1,"my girlfriend absolutely swears by this place. we've lived in portland, oregon and columbus, ohio, and this is still the bra shop she prefers to go to whenever she needs new stuff. why? there simply aren't enough good bra shops out there, and the ones that are there tend to work in extremely limited sizes. this place doesn't. she loves the service, is happy with the prices, and always comes home with a smile (and honestly, so do i)."
1-star,0,"i only get an hour long lunch break, and i was hoping to get a bra fitting in that time. this place is a fifteen minute drive from my office, so if i got a half-hour fitting it could have fit in my schedule. i called ahead to see if i schedule an appointment. the woman on the phone said she wasn't taking any appointments for mid-day that day, but if i came in i could probably just get a fitting right then and there. i asked her if she was busy now or if it was normally busy fifteen minutes from now and she said no. i arrived, and i saw one woman walking toward the store as well. if i had wanted to be a jerk, i could have ran to the door and beat her to it, but i did the non-jerky thing and just held the door open for her, so she walked in the door first. turns out she was going there for a bra fitting as well, and there was only one attendant on at 11:30am when we were there. the woman said i could stay and wait for her to be done with the other woman, but those appointments are a half hour long, so i declined, fuming that i had wasted my lunch freak and didn't even have any food during it. i looked around, but the prices seemed exorbitant. in the end i wound up going to soma in west towne mall for a fitting and then buying extra bras at walmart."
5-star,1,"in an ideal world, we would all have professional stylist and tailors to tell us how to accentuate our natural curves. since most of us are not that lucky, our best option is to hope that the sales associates at generic stores can assist us. i am a very busty lady with a relatively small waistline which makes it a nightmare for me to find bras that fit correctly. i have been searching for a bra to wear with a fancy dress and after trying out 2 major lingerie stores in madison, i was told that neither carried my size. one associate was kind enough to suggest going to contours since they apparently have a wider range of sizes. so i stopped by contours today on my lunch break with little-to-no expectation of being able to find a bra. i was surprised to find out that not only do they carry my size (which at the time i believed to be a 36g) but was also thrilled to hear that they carried bras all the way up to hh (and possibly higher?). when i walked in i was able to look around for a few minutes before someone was able to help me. don't be fooled when you look around. they have all the lingerie on display but all of their bras in the back of the store. after a short wait i was prompted to go into a fitting room where the owner of the store proceeded to measure me. [side rant]let's stop for a minute to address some others claims of the associates being ""handsy"". this is insane. how in the world can you expect someone to fit you for a bra if they are unable to actual touch you in any way? in addition, a professional will want to touch the bra and also show you how to get your breasts situated correctly so that person can see whether or not it is fitting correctly. bras are a tricky thing. it's all about how the weight is distributed between your waist and shoulders. most women (myself included) have found bras that distribute the majority of the breast weight on the shoulders. this usually results in back, shoulder, & neck pain and potentially headaches and migraines. what a good bra should do is distribute more weight to your waist so there isn't so much on your shoulders. now tell me this: how is a professional bra fitter suppose to tell if the weight is being distributed correctly if that person is unable to ""touch"" the bra or your boobs? [/side rant] i was surprised when i found out that my waist was actually a 32 and the cup was h/hh. i was even more surprised when she brought in about 15+ bras in an assortment of styles and colors that were all in a 32 hh! never in my life have i had so many options to choose from when bra shopping (it was a really good feeling). i tried on several bras and the owners told me what bras would be appropriate for what clothing (t-shirt, v-neck, button-down, etc). she also helped me find a bra that would work with the dress that i had. she had me try on some bras with the dress, and what i really appreciated was that she talked me out of a strapless bra because lets face it...hh is a lot of weight to support without any straps. so she told me what minimal alteration i would need to do to the dress to wear a regular bra with it. this was a major bonus for me because i hate that feeling of buying a strapless bra for that ""one time"" i need it. now i can buy and wear a comfortable bra with a fancy dress and no one will know the difference! all-in-all, i walked out of that store with 4 bras and an incredibly nice gift from the owner. both the owner and other staff member were very polite, helpful, and really passionate about getting me fitted correctly. you don't see that level of dedication from just any ""generic"" lingerie store. i felt empowered when i left and will most certainly be going back. summary: give it a try with an open-mind and you will be pleasantly surprised."
1-star,0,"i had read a few negative reviews about the store but decided to check it out after a friend had good things to say. when i arrived at the store i was greeted by two people. one was clearly the owner and i immediately didn't like her attitude. she said she didn't have time to ""make up fake reviews"" when i mentioned i had read a few negative reviews. i was happy to have the other individual size me. the positives are they do appear to have a large selection based on the bras she brought me. but that's where the positives end. the negatives. i'm not convinced the bras fit me very well. i've been measured before and have always been told the area between the cups should sit flush on your chest. this lady said it doesn't have to. i feel like i'm spilling out a be but the employee told me to just tuck in my boobs a bit more. she also measured me to be a smaller cup than i'm currently wearing. i thought i would take a chance and paid a small fortune for three bras. got home and did some comparison pricing online and found them much cheaper on almost every site..generally around $25 cheaper. in the end it's my fault. i haven't worn them and i know their return policy, i can't return them. won't be going back."
4-star,1,"victoria was extremely helpful knowledgable and listened to what i was looking for. i hesitated on purchasing because of price, but upon further bra shopping will probably go back for the bra that fit me best and was same price as elsewhere."
5-star,1,"i bought bridal lingerie and they were very clear about pointing out the store policy of returns only for store credit. i really liked the bras (finally something that fits!) so even if my long line bra does not go with my dress, i will probably keep it anyway because it looks amazing and is totally worth $140. they do a great job, sell expensive stuff that works, and know their stuff about holding up your girls. just make sure you remember to check your inner ""bridezilla"" at the door and, you know, remember how to read? the return policy is posted on the walls all over the store. maybe this is in response to the people who have complained below but it was very clear to me. posted in all the fitting rooms as well. i kind of think a lot of ""brides"" these days think they are a little too important and assume they get what they want. a small shop like contours isn't going to take your ""maybes"" back all the time or they would go out of business. they want you to leave with something you will love."
1-star,0,"the same thing happened to me that happened to allie below. it was actually about a year ago, but i was just reminded of it! since i was so busy with wedding stuff back then, i hadn't had time to write a review. i went here to find a longline bra to wear under my wedding dress. after explaining the situation, we went through their return policy and they explained they'd ""make and exception for me"", since my next fitting was in more than 30 days (like 32 or something). they made a note on the front of my receipt, but never mentioned that it would only be for store credit. in the month between buying it and the fitting, i acutally had left it in my car, in the bag, so i didn't forget it or have any damage to it. it was $140! as a young bride, i didn't have that kind of money to waste! a month later, lo and behold, the bra didn't fit with the dress. when i brought it back to return it though - sorry! only store credit. i was shocked. i explained (to the owner) that the saleswoman i had worked with wrote on my receipt i'd be able to return it after my fitting, la la la... but she became defensive immediately. i assume this happens often. she told me the line about how she'll actually be taking a loss on it because they'll have to clean it, to which i explained it actually hadn't been out of the bag, save when i had tried it on earlier that day at the fitting. she said in case i had a cat, they needed to have it laundered. for people with allergies. what?? i said i didn't have a cat, but it didn't seem to matter. the owner then showed me the back of the receipt, noting that for bridal items, there's only in store credit. this is such a ridiculous policy (what the hell makes a bra a bridal bra?), but i would have understood it if i didn't feel they tried to skirt the issue when they sold it. if that is your policy, you need to clearly explain it, not assure someone they can return it, omitting that they'll never see that money again. in the end, she gave me an extra $5 dollars so i could buy two normal bras for that price. whoopie. i didn't need new bras, i needed money to pay for my wedding. they have nice stuff, don't get me wrong, but their dishonesty really overshadowed all for me."
2-star,0,"i was shopping for a bustier to wear under my wedding dress and found an option at contours. it was $145 which was way more than i wanted to spend, but i thought it'd be worth it if it worked. i was told, verbatim, that i could ""return within 30 days of my dress fitting"" which was perfect, as my fitting was about an hour after i bought it. the bustier didn't end up working with the dress, so i brought it back 2 hours after i'd purchased it. only then did they inform me that they only accept returns for store-credit, not a refund. they cited ""cleaning costs"" as a reason, which is ridiculous considering i wore the bustier longer while trying it on in store than i did at the dress fitting. i can understand not accepting underwear, but owning a bustier for 2 hours on a saturday afternoon does not in any way warrant ""cleaning."" it would have been one thing if they had told me this up front, but that would lose them too many customers. they were very calculated with their verbiage while i was there, never once saying ""we only accept returns for store credit"" in the multiple conversations we had about their policy, and they were just as calculated and rehearsed with their responses when i came back to return it. their defense was ""the policy is printed on the back of your receipt""... you know, that thing that's given to you *after* you purchase something. i guess my mistake was trusting the words that came out of the sales girls' mouths during the initial visit. i don't dispute the quality of the things they sell or even their return policy, but i'll never be back there thanks to their intentionally deceitful staff."
5-star,1,"i haven't been here in awhile. unfortunately for me my bra size is so expensive i wear my bras for longer than i should. i know, i know. shame on me, but i'm a poor college student. this place is the only place i've been able to find my cup size in though! you may scoff, but as a 34hh it's no easy task to find an in person store who carries my size. i almost jumped around in joy when i discovered that! this place gives a great fit. they definitely know what they're doing, unlike the terrible, terrible staff at victoria's secret. i have no idea who i worked with, but i know it was one of the owner's. she was a peach! she was just so helpful! she even gave me a few sites i didn't know about where i can find my sized bras. i found it shocking that she was more than happy to hand over other places to find my bras. maybe she felt my pain in finding the right size. either way, when i get a chance i'll be back in. oh, and the prices were pretty competitive with the sites i've had experience with."
5-star,1,"amazing spot for bras and lingerie! finally found somewhere with a great selection in my size. the staff is super helpful and knowledgeable, and patient with fittings. they made me feel right at home! plus the lingerie is all super sexy and cute. highly recommend stopping by for a fitting- it will change your life!"
1-star,0,"i reiterate what several other reviewers state: the bras they fit you with are so doggone tight you won't end up wearing the bras. when you question this, the sales staff is not helpful and tells you that this is the size you are supposed to wear. i mean really, what is the point of having women uncomfortable with their bras? which is more important: your per-determined belief re: the client's correct size or the comfort of the client? i bought 3 bras and returned one. i should have returned two. the only bra i like is the sport bra. the others are one full size too tight under your chest. i, also, have ""rolls"" from the too-tight bra and i""m not fat. great concept; poor fitting around the torso. the sales staff needs a complete overhaul at this store. owner, are you listening???? the other thing i don't like is the only bras they brought to my room are colors i would not normally buy -- bright blue, red&grey, wine, etc.... when you are buying a new bra, you want the most neutral color you can get. how is it that they don't have any neutral colors? sign me, disgusted and mega-uncomfortable"
5-star,1,"ladies, do yourself a favor and stop by this shop to get you some new lovelies. contours is one of the few shops in madison that follow the proper way to do bra fittings (aka the european method of the number being the number in inches of a band tightly just under your boobs and the cup size being the difference in inches from the first measurement and that of you at the fullest part of your boobs when you are leaning over slightly). if you've ever been measured at victoria's secret or some other mall store, you are probably wearing the wrong sized bra. if your straps fall down all the time, you're probably wearing the wrong sized bra. if you get the quad boob thanks to the cups cutting into the top of your boobs, you're probably wearing the wrong sized bra. if your band is riding up a ton, you're probably wearing the wrong sized bra. if you have a larger than average sized chest, you're probably wearing the wrong bra. if you're wearing a size small or x-small shirt and you got your bra at vicky's or a regular store, you're probably wearing the wrong sized bra. the workers at contours know how to do proper bra fittings (or you can do them yourself with an online guide (www.reddit.com/r/abrathatfits) and bring in your size) and can help you find the styles that work best for you. bras here are going to be more expensive, but having one that properly fits makes a world of difference. when i went i came home with one new bra and noted several other styles that i liked which i may pick up online. they tend to be cheaper online, but getting to try on several different styles all at once is worth the premium prices you pay here. i didn't have an appointment, but rather just stopped by when out shopping. the sales gal i worked with didn't seem pushy at all and had a very relaxed pace. i wasn't rushed at all. i knew they had a nice selection of bras, but i was pleasantly surprised at the variety and quality of lingerie that they also had on hand. a wide variety of sizes from xsmall to plus sizes is wonderful to see. fellas, if you want to get some quality undergarments for your ladies, this is the place to go. they even will keep your sizes on file along with a wishlist to make future shopping trips (or present buying) an easier affair."
5-star,1,"women...you must visit contours! i've always thought vs was the place to buy bras until i went to contours. their professional staff were great...tactfully explaining and showing me how my bras i have now fit wrong!!! their classy approach to fittings and explanation of how bras should fit and how to care for them was great. yes they are a little more than vs per bra (mine was $60), but i really believe they are made better and have a superior fit!"
5-star,1,"amazing. i am very petite and so is my chest. after having 2 kids i really needed help and decided to go to a real bra shop and have someone fit me properly. it was a revelation! i now have the proper support and feel a lot better about my chest size:). it is not cheap, but it's worth it if you can spare it."
5-star,1,"big busted ladies of southern wisconsin: get thee to contours! after living in the uk for 3 years, where finding bras for larger sizes is easy peasy (think standard selection in department stores as well a great chain specialty lingerie shop), i was stressed when i came back to wisconsin. with an upcoming wedding, i was in need of a strapless, longline bra. nothing crazy. just standard special occasion underwear. most gals wear such things under a bridal gown. i spent a week scouring madison. all the department stores from jcpenney to boston store to macys to kohls. i checked victoria's secret, knowing it would be in vain (as their sizing is hilarious on a good day) and even the lingerie department of lane bryant as they stock a broad range of sizes. very few carried special occasion bras, and none carried larger sizes. i tried david's bridal. nope.then i did some googling and learned of contours. while i was away from madison, some great new things definitely have happened, and contours is one. although i did have to wait a while for my personal fitting appointment (as the shop owner was with another client), the sales gal was super kind and offered us (i was shopping with the mother) water and a comfy place to sit. for a small boutique, they have a really great selection of bras and underwear in all shapes, sizes, and colors. and guess where they get most of their stock from? the uk! so, happily, my knowledge of my current bra size in uk terms made for a super easy try-on session. i walked away with a very expensive, but very perfect bra for my big day. did i pay a little more in contours than i might've online for the same garment? yes. was it worth it for the personal service and knowledge that i was supporting a local, independent business? absolutely. i plan on going back here for other undie needs and will be sending anyone i know who mentions their need of big-busted bras! (though they stock a range, they seem to specialize in carrying larger sizes not available elsewhere). contours: i love it."
5-star,1,"contours lingerie is simply amazing! i wear a very unique and difficult size and can't ever find something comfortable and cute in mass stores. contours is very attentive during your personal fitting as well as professional and honest. i've never had so many bras that fit to chose from, but also didn't feel pressured to overspend. absolutely worth a trip! give yourself 1-1.5 hours to really enjoy the experience."
5-star,1,"best bra shopping experience ever. but then again, i just had my breast augmentation 6 weeks ago. thought i was going to be 38c, little shock horror i was actually 36e. tia brought out about 25 different styles, cuts and colors to try. picked my favorite 4 for different occasions, plus a sports bra. you do not get this service/selection at the mall or large department store. tia you rock bring this service to madison - thank you!!!"
5-star,1,"i trust my giant knockers to contours lingerie. amazing, personalized and friendly service, and a great selection of bras that actually fit my f cup jugs. either of those would be enough, but the two combined are freakin' awesome. i highly, highly recommend this place, especially if you're like me and have a hard time finding bras in your size."
5-star,1,"i've been wearing chucks since.... well since they weren't cool and a statement of youth and thumb in the eye of society. a long time. and i've been buying them at this converse store since the mall opened the workers have always been nice, pleasant, let you shop and are available if you have a question or need them to check in the back for a particular size. the store itself is always well organized and even on the discount wall you don't have to search the size 4 shoe area while you're looking for size 11. i've been to several converse outlet stores but this one is always better than the rest. though they didn't have what i was looking for today, i'll be back for some new chucks, soon. oh and def hit the discount wall. i've picked up varvatos chucks at steep steep discounted prices."
5-star,1,"i found two pairs of great shoes. they had a sale going on top of the outlet price so i walked out paying less than i had planned to. i believe the employee who helped me was avanti (sorry if i got it wrong). nice guy, helpful and friendly."
1-star,0,"so the manager of the actual store (victoria estrada) contacted me via email on 4/22 and stated ""we take consumer issues very seriously and always strive for an amazing experience in our stores."" i replied to her request for information by advising her i had already provided it to the corporate office. i haven't heard back from her. it's been 10 days. so apparently they don't take consumer issues seriously."
5-star,1,amazing staff.! everyone is so helpful.. sales always going on..! make sure to check out clearance section and to ask for sizes in the back if you dont see it on the floor.!
5-star,1,"i love when they have their 50% off sales because i'm always finding things that i miss out on, on ebay i really enjoy the store and they really have some great employees there."
1-star,0,shoes are very nice but please stay away from the socks . it's does look good but the feeling suck. it's keep slipping down to the middle of my feet when i walk. and also left a uncomfortable mark after couple hours using it. look at my picture below.
4-star,1,we usually stop by once in awhile when we are in the area to browse the stores to see what is new. today we stopped in and hit the mother load of a deal at the converse store where we picked up two pairs of all stars (his and hers). buy one get one 50 % off so mine only cost $15 bucks! we snagged two pair of shoes and two additional sets of laces for $52 total which is less than 1 pair at full price! we will be back for sure as the selection is great and the staff is friendly. i like that the store is clean and organized as well. my baby boy and i will be back for sure to shop for a great deal! i have a dirty mind.
5-star,1,excellent selection of character chucks. they always have really good sells on their shoes. this is my go to place for a new pair of kicks. they pretty much cover all of the sizes from infant through adult (size 14's). i don't think i have ever walked out of here without a pair of shoes.
5-star,1,"love coming to costco! especially if your a big family they have great size amounts of food. love getting water bottles from here for $3 for like 42 bottles. they have great deals on snacks sometimes. also they have ice creams, meats, milk, eggs, & croissants for a great price. they have samples thru the store as well. after shopping we love going to their food court!"
1-star,0,"costco is costco i feel, but customer service is still customer service and thats what they dont seem to have when issues pop up. to start i added my mom onto my account. who would have known that adding someone was such a fuss? they gave my mom a piece of paper and said it was her temporary membership because the photo machine wasnt working. the same day when she checked out they wouldnt even honor the piece of paper because it was only good for today and apparently that means it was already expired? the supervisor had to come and look at it and it was a mess. cutting it short we got through the checkout line. my mom wanted a churro. bailey who took our 1 churro order was friendly. until we waited over an hour for a churro. i kept asking her what the deal was and she just kept saying ""well they are done they just need to be handed out"". it takes an hour to hand out a churro thats already done? everyone else recieved their hot dog, pizza or ice cream way before i even recieved a churro and i was before them? we went back up to customer service area where my mom was supposed to recieve her card. diane was nice but she really didnt know how to work anything and seemed to struggle since the time me and my mom arrived, got groceries a churro and still didnt have my moms membership id ready. total of 4 hours. walking out at the door we advised tracy of our poor service. she seemed to not even care. not even willing to get a manager or anything. her reply to our concerns were just ""oh really? aw im sorry that cant be here at our costco"". well it was at your costco tracy. and nobody seemed to want to get a manager when asked, instead avioded it. never will i come to this specific costco."
5-star,1,"costco has always been a great place to shop. however, the above and beyond customer service i received yesterday just took it to a new level. with a 20 day old newborn i made the mistake of forgetting to pull the feeding bottle out of the cooler pocket early, so it could come to room temp in time for feeding. with a fussy baby ready to eat i went to the restroom to run the bottle under the faucet in the hopes of expediting the warming process. i didn't even make it to the faucet before a very observant employee stopped me and said ""that water won't be hot enough for your needs, follow me."" without hesitation he took me to the employee break room and heating me up a cup of water. during this process he told me how he had 5 kids and had heated plenty of bottles in his day. i was overwhelmed with gratitude and awestruck with the above and beyond service this staff member offered. my only regret is not getting ""his"" name in the mix of it all. costco: if your wanted to further look into who it might have been this is what i know. he had 5 kids, about 5:10 (i think), and it happened at about 12:45 on 5-9-18. thank you"
5-star,1,costco is the best! they have such amazing items and almost all of them are great quality. if i do happen to not like something tough i really enjoy their great return policy. i have found they are starting to have so many non gmo and organic products. the only problem about costco is sometimes i get hooked on a product that they eventually discontinue.
5-star,1,"our favorite ccostco! always stocks regular necessities as well as new, enjoyable products. the staff is friendly and helpful. the store is always kept clean and they have goodies to sample. love their prices and the gas station."
4-star,1,"this is my favorite costco near me. usually clean and organized quite well. i wish they did more sales like i saw in utah. the staff here are friendly and i do enjoy the samples. i especially like to tell each demo person ""thank you"", as i'm sure they don't hear it enough. it's hard sometimes to walk away from their sales pitching. the food service up front is really fast and the taste is good. i'd say my most favorite part of costco is the very meat packed rotisserie chicken. grocery stores can't come close to costco. keep up the great work guys!!"
5-star,1,"lots of lines open and very helpful staff, quick in and out at this location. the gas station also moves at a decent pace. definitely recommend this location"
1-star,0,"costco, especially this one, is having difficulty handling their check out queues. in addition, i recently had a broken foot in a boot...and they only had the electric carts available on about 2 of 6 visits. getting less and less impressed with their pricing other than gasoline; and, their ceo's tendency to censor conservative books is a real negative."
5-star,1,"i love costco. everyone is friendly, great prices, fast lines. also, if you want to return something, they will accept it, and give you a refund, no questions asked. great place"
1-star,0,"i am very appalled at the lack of service or even compassion i was treated with today! our family moved to arizona 5 months ago and have shopped for groceries no where but this costco location which is further from my home. being raised in hawaii if you decide that a business is good to its customers you support that store by being loyal. we have spend hundreds even thousands since we've been here and just bought a brand new flat screen last weekend. today my family and i tried to shop there like usually, this time we had brought my 8 yr olds new puppy who weighs 2 lbs and just got shots. so according to vet i can't leave her alone for 24-48 hrs incase a reaction occurs. i never would normally bring a pet to a store, but sunday's are the only days my husband is off to shop. i had total confidence this would not be a problem since i always see dogs in the store whom are definately not service dogs. i had puppy in large plastic tub so she would not touch cart or anything in store. i was stopped at door and asked if she was a service dog... i explained that no puppy at eight weeks so it could be considered a service dog because they are just too new. i explain the whole situation with the shots and then i would normally not bring her but didn't have a choice. i was told by the manager who had a tattoo on his left arm that i was not allowed in the store with the puppy. i was extremely shocked! meanwhile my husband is holding my two-year-old who is crying since we have been waiting at the door for 10 minutes for a manager to show up. i explained to him that she is in a tupperware and would not touch anything she would not be allowed out and we just need to grab some groceries and we shop here weekly. i was told because i did not say she was a service dog she could not come in. i explained to him that i see other animals in the store all the time we're definitely not service dogs and they are walking around on the ground contaminating the store... where is the puppy would be close off in a container and not touch anything. he did not care. i was even told that if i had said that she was a service dog and lied she would have been let in the store. this was shocking to me that my honesty would cause me to receive worst service from a manager! i even explained to the manager that i was so appalled i was even thinking of returning the tv and just canceling my entire membership with costco! he did not say he was concerned at any time, did not say he thought it was unfortunate, he showed no remorse at all! my family now had to drive 40 minutes to and from that costco with no groceries, and a screaming baby, and are now sitting outside of winco seriously contemplating how a business could be run with such horrible and uncompassionate management! i have shopped at many cosco's and this was an absolute disgrace to costco's name! my 8yr old went from being excited about her new puppy to mortified. since costco and management did not show any appreciation or care that we were thinking of cancelling our costco account - we took our business to winco for the first time! the service was great! management came over to check on us since we had the puppy, they also have policy for no pets besides service dogs but he was able to see puppy would not contaminate or bother anyone, puppy was tiny and shouldn't be left alone, and appreciated having us as customers and welcomed us! i didn't have to buy a huge quantity of anything to get the wholesale price, so thanks costco to pointing us to another business. instead of dropping $400-$600 at costco we only had to spend $250 for all the same things. https://youtu.be/8im62ouvezm video taken at costco to show we were stopped at door like criminals"
5-star,1,the gas prices are always the lowest and the price for food is reasonable. the return policy for electronics is the best when it comes to retail.
5-star,1,"hot dog and pop, $1.59+ tax. fabulous deal!!! had a living social deal. got a $20 gift card with membership, and coupons. i like the meal area best. co-worker goes there weekly."
4-star,1,"dr bush is just fantastic! we drove 2.5 hours from n az only to find out that the front desk person jenna lost our appointment. when she was the one who took it! she was extremely frustrating and the conversation was going nowhere when dr bush came out and took us anyway. even then jenna was attempting to push on the power button and make me to find the number i called when i made an appointment. (the phone records go back only two weeks). dr bush had been taking care of us for a really long time and i do understand how difficult it is to find a rally good front desk person, therefore i guess the search continues ;-)"
4-star,1,costco always seems to please. we enjoy visiting them all around the country. this particular location is larger than some with a large variety of food options. they have specialty alcohol for purchase in a viewing case with prices up to $1500. they also have large gun safes and smaller quick release safes for handguns great for under the desk or attached to a night stand. the location is always busy but well kept. the people are great and they really make you feel welcome!
5-star,1,"always excellence in service and this time i visited the auto center to have my air in my tires checked. auto technician cameron notified me of my front passenger tire did not look right and he highly encouraged me to take some time to have them assess it and have it fixed if needed and was concerned if i continue to ride on it, i could have a potential massive blowout. i had some time on my hands and decided to have it checked out. i am very fortunate that i had the time to spare because it was confirmed that same tire was pulling apart badly and it could have been very bad news if i continued to ride on it. i had no idea! they were able to change my tire for a new one and rotate my wheels in a very timely manner. i was impressed! i am a huge fan of costco and it's employees. thank you cameron for your proactive actions in saving me from what could have been a horrible experience. my new tire was in total $149.20 for the turanza serentiy plus performance with a 75,000 mile warranty, tire instal and tire rotation. i made out on this price deal and it was confirmed by an auto specialist that informed his company could not touch that deal whatsoever. sweet! i love costco! :)"
2-star,0,"went here because i was in the neighborhood and wanted to get a few ink cartridges refilled. customer service here is really subpar. girl behind the photo counter refused to even acknowledge me until i actually called for her outloud, even though she had looked up from her cell phone twice. i really wish costco would prevent employees from using their cell phones while on duty and in plain sight of customers. it is very unprofessional. go to the back, use it on break but not in front of customers."
1-star,0,"tracy was her name. i went to this location to get hot pizza and a hot dog. she stopped me at the front, asked for my costco card. i said my grandma and i share it, 80% of the time she uses it. they way she asked was not polite at all! there was no ""excuse me sir"" or even just ""sir"" she yelled at me, ""do you have your card!? i explained myself the situation. i also told her to look our account up, and that will match our address and last name. she straight up said ""no"" you need to have a card in order to come inside here. she kept directing us back outside. if she had a sensible brain, she wouldn't have made it a big deal in front of everyone. she should've asked me to step to the side and explain me what ever she had to say calmly, and most importantly with a polite character. all in all, i just felt horrible, and sad for that lady. she maybe just having a bad day, but her bad day cost that coscto a customer. and other future costco potential customers. i always talked up coscto (because of the pricing quality of stuff and service), since i have had a couple of incidences which i let slide, this one by far was the worst customer service i have received! i will talk people out from joining coscto, and also to make it well known about this incident, i made sure all my friends and their friends shared this on facebook. hopefully she was not racist! that would be horrible for coscto. next time watch your mouth tracy! have a wonderful day"
1-star,0,"in regards to the ebt at check out on 2/19/2016 between 8pm & 845pm. apparently the ebt system was down or you guys were having some issues. next time please have a sign at main entrance. it was extremely embarrassing and stressful having to make a decision between paying for the food we need and paying my electric bill. only because my 8 year old was with me and i had no choice but pay with money i didn't have and now i will be late paying my electric bill. it was either that or having to explain to my child that i can't pay for our food! the cashier just kept apologizing nice and loud and clear for the whole world to hear. and the man who she had called over to verify if the system was down, he didn't even acknowledge me, he kept eye contact with the cashier and just told her ""yes, it's still down"" and walked away.... really? just so everyone is clear. having an ebt card is not a choice of the matter...it's a necessity so i can feed my daughter and myself. i don't need to explain my life issues and how i went about receiving an ebt card and i am not ashamed to use one since i don't have a choice at the moment...but let me tell you, i've never been so embarrassed. so much so that i will not be back at this property ...only to get gas. this location is near my house, visit here frequently for years. and my last post on 2/1/2015 was 4 stars. would have been 5 but the eye exam receptionist was rude and tacky. but i enjoy shopping at all costco's and they vary in service pending on which property/neighborhood it's in. and lately service here is sterile. cashiers are usually the only ones with a smile on their face. sad, cause i would be beyond grateful to have any job and i would have empathy and understanding with customers. i'm sorry maybe i wrote this review too soon and it's not easy for me to address this but i can't imagine what it would have felt like if i really had no money at all, to leave all that food there and walk out empty handed having my 8 year old ask me why. and now i just hope i can somehow magically come up with enough $ to pay my electric bill on time!"
4-star,1,"great costco location. as a tucson native with a million siblings (not an exaggeration or anything), i spent many weekends trolling the aisles at the grant location down there, searching for my mother (you know, the ush). so obviously i'm pretty much a costco expert, and as such, i can tell you that this location is far from the busiest location in the valley and far from the least quality location. is this location busy? umm duh. it's costco. the only location i have ever been to that wasn't busy was the cave creek/101 location and let me be real with you guys--that location was so empty that it resembled that movie zombieland. i don't know about you but i'm not really feelin' zombieland when i'm buying tomato sauce in bulk, but hey if that's your jam, head on over there. so anyway, like i was saying, sure this costco is busy, but it's only cuckoo bananas during the holidays. i'm going to go ahead and take a wild guess that all of them are like that though, so hey, it's all good in the yorkshire hood. i've never had any issues with the quality of the produce or meat here. great layout of da goods, and the sample ladies and gents are pretty rad. also, the parking lot is way better than some of the locations in the east valley for sure. the only downside of this location is the occasional slow-walker killing my fast-walking vibe. that being said, this location has a wider selection of products in comparison to the zombieland one so...i guess we will all just have to deal with the slow walkers. that's life though, right?"
4-star,1,"the only beef i have about costco is this; please add a little fitting room!! i wanted to buy a swimsuit and all women know you have to try 20 on to find one that fits decent. when i asked if i could try it on in the restroom, i was told i had to buy it first.. does this make sense? so now i have a ""too small"" swimsuit that i need to drive all the way back to return..ugh.."
4-star,1,"we always get gas from here.. love the coffee too ;) one thing i hate is that when i go there with my husband and forget my wallet, he has to pay but the costco card is on my name, so they won't allow him to pay because he's not a member!!?weird! we have the same last name, they should allow it if i'm there with him! it's frustrating."
4-star,1,"i come here for a lot of shopping from groceries to books, to household items, even gas. i love costco and my family does too! you buy things in bulk and they are cheaper because they are in bulk. and i love that they don't use plastic bags for your groceries and instead they recycle the boxes they used from when the shipments came, so i find that to be earth friendly and cool. they have on site food, frozen yogurt, and drinks with a place to eat. the kids love it and i'm such sucker for their frozen yogurt berry sundae. it's so cheap and so delicious and so is their pizza!!!! the only reason i didn't give this place 5 stars is because every time i go the lines are always insanely long. doesn't really seem to matter what time of day you go, they are busy and have long lines that stretch into the aisle which is great for them because it means their business is booming. but it would be nice if they had a couple of cashiers that could run to help with check out service to get the line crushed down. and i'm giving it 4 stars and not 5 also because they seem to pick and choose when they want to card you at the door, it's really weird. i can watch some people walk in ahead of me and not flash their cards at all and i'll be right behind them and i get chased down to check to see if i'm a member. it's annoying but it's not going to stop me from going there for their yummy food and amazing discounted prices. i'm a fan, yay!"
2-star,0,costco has many redeeming qualities. not all but just a few of these redeeming qualities are great big savings on..... car tires dry goods some produce sometimes fresh fish healthy natural dog chews called nubz ( a costco exclusive ) offered occasionally big bottles of booze cheap they also do food demos that some people call lunch. this store sometimes has problems with too much moldy produce (see photos) and too many loose carts in the parking lot. (see photos) they also occasionally let people in with their pets. (see photos) i somewhat forgive them for most of their faults but need to drop them a star for messing with my chicken. i liked the packaged chicken they used to sell but they replaced that better chicken with foster farms chicken. i don't think foster farms is bad chicken but it's just ok chicken that i could buy at fry's. (if i wanted to.) the breast and thighs are much smaller and lighter color meat with less flavor than the other chicken they used to sell for the same price. meh. i've just experienced better chicken someplace else.
4-star,1,"a week ago, while i was on my way to work, the ""low fuel"" light on my car turned on. so, i decided to go to costco to fill up. got there, filled up, hopped back in my car, and it wouldn't start. it was dead. d.e.a.d. dead. :( the attendant was awesome. he quickly ran over and helped me push by behemoth of an suv out of the way, so as not to block the pumps. he even asked if i needed to call someone for help. i really admire the caliber of employees costco hires. the reason i only give 4 stars is that the location is terrible. it's in an awkward location, which prevents easy access."
5-star,1,"one of the rare 5-star reviews i'll give because it just doesn't get any better than this. forget disneyland, this is my happiest place on earth! i have a (pathetic) habit of visiting costcos in every city i visit to see what regional goodies they offer. this is my 'home' costco. it's a little like cheers - i know most/all of the employees by name and/or sight, and i'm such a costco fixture that many of them know me. and the team here is a helpful one. i know the layout of the store and can easily spot new items as they arrive. in short, this store is like a comfortable old shoe...that also sells bargain-basement gas! ;-) if i could find one complaint, it's that meat prices have recently risen a lot, but it's still a bargain relative to most meat markets."
5-star,1,"costco, home of the $5.99 rotisserie chicken! yummy costco, home of the free lunch while shopping! seriously costco, home of the how in the hell did we spend $300 on toilet paper, pumpkin pie and captain morgan? costco, home of the... what they are out... i knew we should have bought that earlier. damn."
5-star,1,"o beloved costco! numerous are the reasons for which you deserve praise. a cavernous structure, awesome to behold, to accommodate a bewildering array of merchandise, easy on the pocket. fresh produce, baked goods, meats, frozen items packaged for assemblages rather than for individuals. tools, small appliances and other electronics to delight even the most jaded gadget enthusiast. gasoline, optometry, insurance, home loans, and the lowest markup on generic pharmaceuticals. patient ladies and gentlemen handing out food samples, tolerating my shameless repeat visits to their stations. refusing to stock a product like that cola from atlanta when its manufacturers would not lower its wholesale price. clothing, home decor, books, music, the list goes on and still i am delighted to see new items with each visit. beloved costco, progeny of kirkland, long may you stay a shining beacon in the world of wholesale!"
4-star,1,"my favorite costco location in the west valley because it doesn't attract as many snowbirds & slow elderly patrons. the aisles don't get as packed and the lines aren't as long as the arrowhead location. parking isn't bad either, and they have pretty much the same selection as the other locations in the valley. only downside is that it is a somewhat sketchy area and you may not want to take a nice car to this parking lot. on the other hand, for snowbirds this area is somewhat confusing with the on/off ramps for both i-17 and the 101, so this keeps them away."
4-star,1,"don't be ashamed, deb. costco is the shizz nizzle dizzle if i can be so-ten-years-ago. and there's always a free mini lunch (via samples) when you visit and they do carry many superior products at prices not found lower elsewhere. though sometimes their prices are higher than grocery stores on some stuff, do your research and don't fall victim to the impulse buy no matter how agonizingly difficult it is!!!!!!!!!!!!!!ljh)*hfoh okay, soooo-you can get discount fox group restaurant cards, prime ribeyes for 8.99/lb (though rare) and the most killer la brea artisan bread, not to mention cheeses and steelhead trout which is the bomb and laundry soap and...okay, i guess you get the point. costco rocks."
5-star,1,"costco provides a much needed service in the valley ...it's kind of like your favorite shady uncle who you know can always help you out. it's not that you really want to spend that much time with your uncle but he always knows a few short cuts to help you out . you get a nail in your tire uncle costco can help you out, you need a birthday cake that tastes good and less expensive,uncle costco has a guy in the back that can help . you are having a party and you need super tasty frozen stuff bada bing bada boo, uncle costco has the stuff. now you know uncle costco can get you the goods but you don't really want to know how he got strawberries in october, or salmon in the desert or even why uncle costco takes everything back so easily.he even got me a huge bag of blackberries from some guys he knows in chile . and the kids always like him because every time you go see him you can get tasty cheapo pizza and frosty yogurts. i am not sure how i came to be acquainted with uncle costco, mom says she has known him forever and part of me knows i need to strengthen my boundaries with him . how long can i turn my eyes from his gas guzzling shenanigans, i guess as long as he can get me me bags of avocados for a song!"
5-star,1,"my experience here was remarkable. when i arrived i felt nothing but positive energy. it was the highlight of my vegas trip. i got to see ryan outside but didn't bother him. i could tell he was very focused on his work and i respect him for that. the cars and mike's bus are so perfect it is almost unbelievable. the bus is very cool in person. tv doesn't really capture it. the quality and detail work on everything was exceptional. i loved getting to see the exact cars i saw being built on my screen. the best part by far were the people. they don't even charge for admission! they appreciate their fans in a very genuine way. every one of them invited me to hang out at danny's place for their weekly meet and greet. if i wasn't flying out tonight i would be there right now. you know immediately that this respect and appreciation for each other and you comes from the top. i have met danny yet but i know by his work family's treatment of everyone around them that he must be an exceptional leader. i bought the t-shirt and kept the receipt as a souvenir to prove i got there, at the shop. i wish everybody there years of health, wealth and happiness. i was genuinely impressed and inspired."
5-star,1,"fun place to go, and free! the crew isn't there for the most part, but there is the nice collection of bikes and cars. also, some nice memorabilia. if you have a cat to get there, it's worth taking a few minutes to go"
5-star,1,"back from our trip to vegas and made a second trip to count's kustoms. roli was in the office and was very accommodating and pleasant, taking pictures with guests. nicest staff in vegas! thank you again for giving us a great experience. roli, you rock! thank you for signing the picture of you and m y husband and getting it back to us so quickly! great place to visit in vegas!"
3-star,0,"the shop and the cars and trucks are awesome, most of the items in the gift shop are overpriced. i wound'nt give you two cents for some of the guys that work for the count. and as far as the count he is so into himself, just like another car builder in texas that's not worth a bucket of bullshit. if you really have to get work done on your ride and you have an extra $50,000.00 to throw away stop in and get fucked by the count."
5-star,1,loved this. i don't watch the show but i enjoy it when i do catch it. the bikes and cars are amazing. the place is on the dark side which is expected but that makes it hard to take some photos.
4-star,1,"fun to see! staff was friendly except the lady we asked to take our picture. she was taking everyone else's. when we got up she rolled her eyes and said not today, ok. we had another visitor snap one for us. no biggie..."
5-star,1,"very fun place to see the vehicles in the show! horny mike's helmet collection is on display, along with many custom cars and motorcycles. a small gift shop with t-shirts is also there and i always find something to buy! a must see in vegas! free admission."
5-star,1,"if you're a fan of the show, and are visiting las vegas, this is a must stop! you will probably see some the people on the show, we saw rollie, and they had horney mikes bus parked outside. we also saw shane directing traffic to the shop, and plenty of cool vehicles inside the shop! would most certainly recommend checking this place out!"
5-star,1,this place is well worth the visit. my wife even enjoyed the visit. like others said you won't see the work going on or the stars but seeing their work in person is a must. they do top notch work imho. it is more or less a tourist destination to promote the show. but that was cool by me. if you love the show. i highly recommend a visit.
5-star,1,"the location this place is at is totally not what i expected. it's not glorious or amazing, its a small place in the back of a business complex shared by other businesses. this actually adds to the coolness of this place. the fact that they can make these old cars beautiful and new out of a small place like this is incredible. they offer free tours of danny's warehouse where he keeps his personal collection, and the cars are beautiful. we were informed when we walked in that danny had just left which was a bummer, but he's incredibly busy so i didn't expect to see him. expect to go though this place in about 10-15 minutes. it's a small place, but its totally worth checking out."
5-star,1,"my hubby is a huge fan of the show, this is our 2nd time visiting. free tour of the showroom, awesome atmosphere. very cool to look at all the cars in the showroom, you can take as much time as you want and all the pictures you want. at the end the have a gift shop area, t-shirts run about $25.00. my hubby got to meet and take a pic with rolli. definitely recommend stopping by, parking attendants are very helpful!"
4-star,1,if you get tired of gambling and your a car buff this is a must see. we took a ride to get my brother a shirt. quite a showroom. nice group of people working there and a nice assortment of merchandise. quite a guys place.
5-star,1,counts kustoms was my favorite thing to do while in vegas. the staff and the customer service we received was amazing. the talent that these guys have is truly mind blowing. i can't believe that the count has decided to make this a free attraction. he truly cares about people and for the love of vintage cars. it is a must see while in vegas!
5-star,1,"awesome place, rollie we love you!!! thanks for info on count vamps awesome place stay sweet and down to earth!!! loved it all was the best attraction both count kustoms & count vamps because y'all are the best down to earth people we have met here in vegas!!!"
3-star,0,"if you are fan of the show you might be disappointed since you don't see any of the cast, but if you want to see some nice cars for free check it out."
5-star,1,"good job count. it was just what i expected. i remember seeing most of the cars in the museum from the show.. the staff was really cool, respectful and friendly. of course, i had to get a count custom shirt."
4-star,1,"been here already a couple times and like checking out the cool rides in the showroom, and its free. will continue to bring friends out to see the count."
4-star,1,cool shop. a big fan of the show and to see some the cars from the show was cool. loved the buick rivera. to see it in person was incredible. i got my favorite souvenir from there. a counts kustom coffee mug. lol. it was not crowded so hot right in. no cost. would recommend.
5-star,1,"highlight of my trip. the collection of cars is awsome, you can tell the love that danny has for his cars and buisness as soon as you walk in. every single bike and car in his collection is beautiful, i wish he was there to ask for a picture but we all know he's a busy guy. i recommend anyone who loves the show or just cars to stop and check it out !!!!!"
5-star,1,"my dad wanted to go see danny's collection while we were in town, i'm glad we came. not a bad way to kill an hour in vegas without spending any money (unless you have to pay for a cab). no line or crowd, parking was easy. cars and bikes were cool, staff was friendly. we saw danny pulling out of the parking lot in some pimp looking car (stutz, i think) as we walked in, and we saw horny mike dragging some parts out of his bus. we didn't approach him, he looked busy, like he was actually working. less of a tourist trap than the pawn shop."
3-star,0,"if you are fan and if you appreciate nice cars, this is a good stop for you. for me, i enjoy the show but not a fan of fancy cars in general so it was ok. my bf appreciated and oohed and aahed over the cars. we spent a lot of money on souvenir shirts and caps. kk was the most expensive of the 3 history channel store shows. coolest designs though."
5-star,1,"staff was extremely friendly and polite. they were a great reflection of how genuine danny appears to be on the show. i accidently drooled on the floor by the '67 gto, sorry danny! this is a great visit if you are in lv. when in vegas, visit counts kustoms!!"
5-star,1,"my husband and i love this show and we decided to stop by the shop. it was a great time. all of the staff was very friendly, from the kid telling us where to park to the nice girl selling me my count's kustoms cap. the collection was amazing. seeing the coffin couch was fun. i might have to have danny build me one someday. :) it was a great experience. we didn't get to see any of the guys but that's ok. maybe next year we will get lucky. :)"
5-star,1,visiting counts kustoms is very much worth the trip! to see their work done on tv is great but to see the cars on person is phenomenal! i wish to one day get a car done by danny & the boys
5-star,1,"went during the week. easy to find, plenty of parking and help with that as there were attendants directing traffic once you pulled into the complex and turned around the building towards danny's main entrance to his museum and store. once inside there were ample people helping with the directing of foot traffic. sign in and walk through the big doors into his store and museum. you have to leave any drinks (sodas, beer, etc.) on top of the refrigerator that is just inside and to the right of the big door. btw that fridge is custom painted. the guys in the paint shop must have been bored with nothing to do one day! absolutely gorgeous rides, bikes and other creations. some of which have been featured on the show like the bicycle horny mike built and lost the bet to scott with and had to ride on the street dressed in a thong. after being painted green! :d a tour bus pulled in, about 30 minutes after my friend and i got there, and a couple dozen tourists walked inside. horny mike and roli came out and did the meet and greet thing, took snapshots with people and answered questions. bought some swag (coffee mug and a dickies cks embroidered work shirt), talked with the celebs a bit and left. it was a fun experience. highly recommended. if the work on the vehicles in the museum is any representation of the kind of work his guys do then i would absolutely recommend having your classic car, truck or bike worked on by them. i wish i had the cash to spruce up my '93 heritage softail. i would have them work on it in a ny minute!"
5-star,1,"i am a sucker for reality tv. counting cars is another one of those easy watching shows, my husband likes the cars, i like that the guys are so easy going and just plain nice, you don't see that much now a days anymore. a lot of guys from the show were there, i had no idea this place had a following like pawn stars. (though they don't have a line around the building or charge entrance) easy parking, sign in, and walk right in to see danny's private collection as well as some other fun stuff. they have an overpriced gift shop, but who doesn't. my husband loved their dickie's jackets, but $145 is steep. that aside, everyone was super nice, the vibe cool, the cars amazing and my guys got a nice break from the girly stuff they had to put up with the day before, win win."
5-star,1,get a gps or take a taxi because it's hard to find. once you get there it's hard to park in the right spot. we had to move. they are in a boxed in area with limited parking. other businesses rent there too and i'm sure they hate the fans taking all their parking. an employee keeps telling people to move their cars. the first thing we saw was horny mike's bus outside. when you get close the paint is amazing. it glitters in the sun. you walk in the shop and right away you are at the counter where they filmed many times. beyond you find danny's collection of cars. there are enough cars that you must adore at least one of them. you can buy trinkets and such if you like. they don't take you in the working shop areas but the tour is self guided and free. i loved being in the shop. i think you would love it too if you've seen the show.
5-star,1,stopped at count's kustom's today. we had the pleasure of meeting danny and taking photos with him. he is very nice!! he hasn't let stardom go to his head!!!
5-star,1,took my wife and two boys to check out the shop. friendly staff but unfortunately after about 25 minutes they notified us that they would be closing for filming. nice choppers and cars in the collection for viewing. no charge to enter. roli stepped-in for a second and was nice enough to take a picture with my boys. will come back when i'm in lv again to spend time in the gift shop. thanks count's kustom!
1-star,0,"this shop is a freakin joke!, scott is a idiot and i will never use this shop nor allow anyone i know to use it. have to make an appointment to event talk to anyone about a project, and it takes 30 minutes to get that much help out of the staff there"
1-star,0,"came all the way to the mall just to go to dicks. yelp, there website. everything says. open till 7pm. it's 615. and... the entire thing is closed. this isn't okay. i will be taking my business to amazon."
1-star,0,"this store has not much of a selection in licensed merchandise. no nhl, very little nfl . we are a week from the world cup and they only have 2 teams. unless you need the basics then don't waste your time here."
5-star,1,have to give a kudos to aaron in the athletic shoes department. he is as very helpful and patient. great service hasn't always been our experience at dick's so this was a pleasant surprise!
5-star,1,this particular location of dick's is the best place for co2 refills. i come here very frequently and they have the process down well so it goes smoothly and efficiently. thanks guys!
1-star,0,"complete disgrace. customer service is a joke and they should be embarrassed. i waited 30 minutes for help in a section and zero employees showed up. i and three or four other customers were left to wander, ignored. i called out to employees from other sections for help and they literally ignored me and walked the other way. i came here ready to spend money. now i am leaving and will never return."
3-star,0,"not sure why i keep on coming into dick's sporting goods, as i hardly ever buy anything, but i guess it's the fantasy of someday being about to do more outdoor activities when if it ever cools down! this location is attached to the scottsdale fashion square mall on the lower level under the harkin's theater. it's a typical dicks's with all the normal stuff you'd find in a sporting goods store. they have all the sport clothing, shoes and accessories, camping supplies, golfing, canoeing, biking stuff and so much more. if you're an outdoorsy kind of person, one could spend a lot of time in here ""shopping"" for all the activities you enjoy. one thing i noticed about this location along with all other locations here in arizona, the staff never ask me if i need any help. they don't ever seem that busy to be honest, just standing around in their areas doing whatever. i'm sure there are times, like on the weekends when this place gets busy and the staff are actually working, i just never see it. prices i suppose are average for a sporting place, but i have found the exact item online for several dollars cheaper even with shipping. so unless i need something right away, i probably won't do much shopping in the actual store."
1-star,0,"these people are untrained or not smart. they leave the sensor on the merchandise, and then when you are 30 minutes away and call them to complain, the best suggestion they can offer is for you to turn around and actually come back to their extremely inconvenient locations to have the sensor taken off! who does this? what is the point of putting a sensor on your merchandise if your employees don't take it off, but also if it doesn't even make the alarms go off?! furthermore, why are you putting useless sensors on ""protective"" football pants, which, if worn with the sensor that you don't remove, could actually cause an injury?! here's an idea, dick's, why don't you train your employees to take the sensors off the merchandise at the time of purchase so that customers don't have to be inconvenienced by driving to your store twice in one day, or provide your customers with a device to take the sensor off themselves, since your employees don't, and it serves no purpose anyway. another idea would be to fix your equipment so that the sensor actually causes an audible alarm which would signal your employees and customers that a sensor needs to still be removed from the merchandise. i've got 8 kids who play sports, but i'll be avoiding dick's and ordering online from now on, i don't have the time-luxury to drive across town four times in one day for no reason."
1-star,0,"omg what a terrible experience at dick's sporting goods at scottsdale fashion square mall last saturday, 7/30/16! ""bo"" in the bicycle department was rude, tried to intimidate me by speaking loudly and over me, and finally just flat out said he didn't have time to look up my warranty info when he found out i bought my bike at tempe's dick's sporting goods!!! rather than telling this rude, young man off, i grabbed my bicycle and took it to tempe. his manager was apologetic and appeared surprised when i told him about my experience and the fact that bo told me he didn't have time to find my warranty info. btw, once i started walking away with my bike, bo was yelling out...""i'll fix it for free""! really? because my warranty plan dictates my tuneup and first flat tire service is free! the only way i would be happy with dick's at scottsdale fashion square mall is by never having to see or deal with bo ever again!!!!"
2-star,0,"my daughter and i went in to the store to look at men's shorts for working out. right off the bat two sales people greeted us one right after the other and we told each of them what we were looking for and both of them said ok great and did not direct us where to look or anything. a third employee approached us a few minutes later and was very helpful, even directing us to a clearance rack for nike shorts. overall,it was not a positive experience and i don't think we will return. we bought one pair there and then we went on amazon prime where we bought several more for two day delivery. the only reason we even bought the one pair there is we wanted him to have something tomorrow because all he had were cargo shorts"
1-star,0,"i walked into your store and couldn't find what i was looking for. i couldn't find help. i said hello how are you to a man (seemed like a manager) and he said ok. i indeed and said just okay and i got a dirty look and was told yes okay. i wanted ski clothing. gloves, hat, boots. i couldn't find any and left. i went to rei and got great service. thank you for wasting my time dick. i don't think i will return."
5-star,1,staff is always friendly and available for help or questions. i also like that each person has their own department they work in. so you're not asking for help in archery from someone who has never held a compound bow.
4-star,1,"your typical dick's sporting goods, just at a great location. staff was pleasant and merchandise was well stocked. the store was very clean (errrr, it's new!)...even the bathroom. it'll do well!"
1-star,0,"i have been a shopper at dick's sporting goods for years, and often have enjoyed perusing their aisles. unfortunately, during my last visit to their store, with my cart there in my hand, i was notified by their staff of their new anti-constitutional fundamental freedom position assumed by their corporate owners. apparently, dick's has determined to support violating the fundamental civil rights of young americans by illegally (in violation of the civil rights act) discriminating against members of the public ages 17-20 by prohibiting them from exercising their 2nd amendment rights and by hiring lobbyists to urge congress to violate the constitutional rights of their consumers. i cannot and will not in good conscience shop at a store like dick's where people who also put on the uniform are discriminated against. if a store wants to get involved in politics--that's great, but it shouldn't be acting like woolworths lunch counters barring african americans during the civil rights struggle. dick's has lost me, despite a good selection of kayaks."
1-star,0,"how does this place survive? it's giant but usually has more employees than customers, and i can see why. they are way overpriced, and the camping and hiking stuff is mostly low quality crap that you can buy much cheaper elsewhere."
1-star,0,"came here with a friend to go over new golf clubs. used them in the test area upstairs, this guy devin was being quite the d.. irritated with his arrogant behavior i put my nike's back and my friend decided to get his new clubs elsewhere."
5-star,1,"dick's is great! you can always find cute workout gear, shoes, golf stuff and random sports equipment like frisbee golf! i like that you can check their stock online so you don't make a useless trip and they have a little bit of everything"
4-star,1,"dicks sporting good has a great overall selection for all sports whether it's basketball football baseball hiking canoeing whatever it is you name it they will have some type of physical inventory for you to look at. you can shop online to find great deals and sign up for the newsletters but if you're someone like me who physically likes to touch and feel some of the items then come in the store. the staff is pretty knowledgeable and there are two floors with the downstairs consisting of mostly football, baseball, & biking. head upstairs and you will find more of the outdoor camping equipment. most of the clothing here is a little pricey but again leverage the coupons online browsing and always check to see if the items you're looking for or available in stores to save you a trip."
5-star,1,"i have been shopping at dicks sporting goods for quite some time now. they always have some fresh nike and under armor gear. the staff is always friendly and they have changing rooms with mirrors so you can try on the clothes. i've been a collector of sports gear and they also have some great suns, asu, dbacks, cardinals gear too. plus i grew up playing basketball so they have great basketballs. i go to the gym a lot too and they have awesome gear for the gym. (hand wraps and gloves) dick's have been good to me with their online program that you use your phone number with. i'm huge into nike and buy my nike gear if i can't find what i'm looking for at the nike stores. plus when it's the olympics they always have really cool olympics apparel"
1-star,0,the manager of this store is racist his name is yorby yost i was profiled coming into the store with my 17 year old son i don't need to steal anything and neither does my son the manager is a racist prick and i'll never spend money at this shit hole store again!!!!!!
1-star,0,"yorby yost knows what he did and should be ashamed of himself. just because your president is racist, doesn't mean you won't get yours when you screw up."
2-star,0,"this review only relates to my experience with an online purchase. i have purchased several items from an actual dicks's store without any issues. in fact, it's my go to store for sports equipment. they have a vast online selection, but their shipping takes too long. expected delivery for a shirt is almost two weeks. this will be my first and last time purchasing anything online from dick's. much easier to purchase from amazon."
1-star,0,"don't try to special order anything from the store. apparently they don't make as much if you special order rather than buying in the store. i spent 10 minutes and went through no less than four employees trying to buy a $100 nike windbreaker. they didn't have my size in stock so i assume they can special order for me because i didn't see it on the website. each time i talk to someone i was pawned off to someone else and made to walk from one side of the store to another and then asked to go all the way to the back. even though the store wasn't that busy, they obviously wanted to help other people who intended to buy things at their store, rather than help me special order a rather expensive jacket. this store is always more expensive than anywhere else, but there are some things you can only get here. i think they know that and that's why they have the attitude they do. after voicing my frustrations to one less person, who still couldn't help me, i walked out of the store. i guess they'd rather sell a little $10 drink it to someone rather than special order a $100 item for someone. that's sad"
5-star,1,dicks is a great sporting good store i've been going there for years they got them all over the country so they make it real convenient and i think anything i want i go to dick's there number one.huge selection happy faces working there very helpful employees
5-star,1,"i wanted to extend my personal thanks to yorby who assisted me with a shoe exchange today. your wide selection, competitive prices and exceptional customer service are what keep me coming back as a customer. dick's is one of the last sporting goods stores around that offers an impressive and quality assortment of sporting goods, clothing and footwear. keep up the good work guys."
1-star,0,"came here to browse items for camping gear. came across the golfing simulator which does not state to ask for help when using. keep in mind we are adults and not teenage kids. (you can hit balls towards a simulated sceen). as we attempted to use the simulator an employee whom must be in high school came over stating, ""can you read that sign for me? this is for paying customers or you need to pay for simulator use."" needless to say i will not be buying any camping gear or anything further at dicks sporting goods due to this child's attitude. very inappropriate and left as soon as this rude employee was done."
5-star,1,"i went to dick's sporting goods to try on some shoes. i was greeted by glen, and he answered every shoe question i had. he was very knowledgeable and would highly recommend going and seeing glen for shoes!"
1-star,0,"went to dick's for bluetooth headphones. the selection wasn't great, but they had a few quality brands. their sales items were somehow still more expensive than amazon, but oh well, i wanted a pair today. after standing around the headphones for 10+ mins i was never asked if i needed assistance. fine, i went to google and amazon for reviews. i decided in a pair but needed someone to get them out of the case for me. i see 4 employees standing around monitoring the shoe sale section, not assisting anyone so i walked up and asked for assistance and was informed they could not help me, i would need a cashier. i'm trying to buy $150 headphones i figure one of them could get someone to come over and assist me. they did not. i ask a cashier for assistance and they ask me to hold on. i wait 10-15 mins near the headphones again, no one comes to assist. the clearance shoe section with no customers was heavily attended too, but apparently buying headphones is so specialized only 3 swamped cashiers can assist. i just left as it became apparent in order to purchase headphones i was going to need to borrow a coleman chair and set up a tent for the week. i won't be going back there, for anything, ever."
1-star,0,"i went here to get my dad a father's day gift and i decided on a yeti tumbler. the shelf was labeled 29.99 and had multi colored yetis on the shelf. when i got to register the cashier told me 39.99 and i advised they were on sale and showed him the sticker on the shelf which had the sale price. he told me that price was for 18 oz tumblers that weren't even on the shelf. i asked to speak to manager who was extremely rude. he told me the ""customers"" must have removed the price tag and placed at least 7 tumblers in the wrong place. i told him that was absolutely ridiculous and they should honor the price since that is the tag on the shelf. the manager said no and then just literally walked away. needless to say, i did not buy the tumbler and dicks sporting goods lost a customer for good."
1-star,0,"purchased a louisville slugger prime 917 bat there on saturday 05/26/17, for my 14 year old son. bat immediately developed a rattle in barrel before first summer high school hitting practice or facing live pitching. tried to exchange but their policy is once the plastics off, you have to file a claim with the manufacturer, which took over an hour on-line and i have to pay to ship it to louisville. my policy is i don't waste my time or money at a business that won't stand behind a product, especially a $400 faulty new baseball bat. horrible customer service. don't waste your time coming here, especially for baseball gear. try extra innings in mesa, rawlings outlet in chandler, big five in ahwatukee, or az mound in tempe."
4-star,1,"w-o-w!!! this is certainly a massively huuuuuge dick's!! who the heck ever said size doesn't matter?!?! just kiddin' ... pun definitely intended ;) but, in all seriousness ... this place literally has all of that, and then some!! the bottom line is that unless you are looking for something obscure, vintage, or antique/ancient related to sporting goods you will either find exactly what you are looking for here, or you will at least find something close to/similar to what you are looking for ... i'm pretty sure that these massive dick's stores have put most of the smaller sporting good stores out of business by this point ... i mean how could another sporting store realistically compete with this place? this store is so big and has so much cool stuff in it that i walk around this place just for fun to check out all the neat things everywhere. if you love sports this place is like being a kid in a candy store ... your eyes open up real wide, and there is literally such a variety of sporting items that it can be nearly overwhelming! the cool thing about dicks is that they typically have a lot of sales going on, which is great ... the odd part was seeing more employees inside than customers ... yet not one of the employees asked if they could help me look for anything ....hmmmm i dunno maybe they were intimidated by me?? it was rather amusing when i went to check out and they had only one register open. there got to be quite a line when one of the customers seemed to be having issues checking out. then, finally they called over another employee, who was probably just hanging out somewhere in the store ""playing"" on their cell phone, to open up another register. many of the employees i walked by seemed to be doing a lot of nothing ... dick's definitely deserves at least 4 stars because i've never seen another sporting goods store anywhere in the us come close to offering what this place does. it truly is a one stop shop when it comes to sporting/athletic gear, clothes, devices, products, etc. the only negative is the lazy careless employees that work here. at the very least it would be more productive for them to stand/hang out in close proximity to the entrance and greet people walking in, and asking them if they need help to find anything."
1-star,0,"dicks is terrible, their customer service is way below what is expected from one of the biggest retailers in the country. i went in to buy my son baseball pants ahead of his first game. they didn't have any in his size of the ones the team required so i was told to order online and use the expedited shipping and they would be here in time. the day they were supposed to arrive i got an email telling me that they wouldn't be there until 4 days later. i then called customer service and they offer to pay me back for the expedited shipping. they thought that not charging me for something that i didn't get was service recovery. unreal, i won't be back."
2-star,0,very poor customer service. long lines and they definitely don't care about keeping their business. manager sweet as pie with the good looking men and totally rude to the young blond and her polite kid. look elsewhere for your sporting goods.
2-star,0,"they looked like they had a good selection of apparel, but sadly that wasn't why i came. the selection of golf club head covers was pathetic. they literally had three genetic ugly ones and then a bunch of cartoon driver covers. a waste of my time."
1-star,0,"and the nightmare continues in tempe this time. a simple tune up and flat tire tube replacement. i get the bike back with a new air valve that requires me to purchase a special valve to fill it with air. i get home and the seat is raised so high i can't ride it. then after adjusting the seat back, i try to ride the bike and only the front brakes are working!!! back tire brake is snuggly against the tire!!! good thing i didn't ride it fast or i would have injured myself. manager josh says he'll have ""melissa"" fix it. last time she ""fixed"" my bike, the tire came off when i was riding it!!!! so no, i don't want melissa ""fixing"" my bike! here's a suggestion - try hiring people over the age of 16! especially when i can get seriously injured by their lack of skills and knowledge! if i had to do it over again i would not buy a bike from dick's sporting goods!"
5-star,1,the service was amazing! j.d. helped me find my golfing outfit and kept showing me new things to try on. it seemed like he really loved his job and that means a lot! also i couldn't find a black nike hat anywhere in the store and one of the employees looked everywhere again for me just to be kind! even though he didn't find one i really appreciate the effort!
1-star,0,this place has the highest prices and the worst customer service of any store i've ever been to. the staff is snotty undertrained and doesn't care if you spend money there or not. the corporate policy is screw the customer.
5-star,1,"they had volley lite balls in stock both times i went to get one. this isn't always the case with other sporting good stores! also, after about 5 weeks the ball lost a bit of air. i tried pumping it and it held for a couple days. since there was no obvious puncture i brought it back to the store for possible return. even though returns are done within 4 weeks and by now it had been almost 6 weeks they made an exception and exchanged the ball! also, it had my daughters name written in permanent marker on it and they still took it back - usually you can't return when you write on them. i thought the customer service was superb!"
1-star,0,"this place was great, then they decided to stop selling firearms. i will not be shopping here again even if they begin selling firearms again. way to cave in to pressure dick's,"
5-star,1,"wow1 what a great experience! everyone there was friendly, helpful, knowledgeable, and considerate. it was a truly amazing experience! compared to my experience at cabela's i was shocked by the impressive, respectful, and knowledgeable staff. prices are fair, people are kind. what a great place to shop for outdoor and fitness gear!"
4-star,1,"this is based on customer service for returns. i bought a nice nf jacket here and, obviously, dropped a pretty penny on it (i'll say!).. only to be on work travel in cali (where i really needed it) and have the zipper come out (made in china or what?). i was seriously peeved: i have bought lots of non-name-brand sweaters and jackets before and *never* have those $30 jackets had a zipper come out!!... to add to that pissed feeling, i'm thinking dick's won't exchange it because it's been well over 30 days. ahh... sigh of relief. i called this tempe location to inquire about the exchange (citing the date of purchase and the cause of wanting to exchange it) and the gal on the phone (i imagine the manager) was super nice and understanding - she told me she hates when that happens and that, of course they'd exchange it and to come on in and she'd take care of it for me. so, i did and got a new jacket (i did check it for zipper quality, hopefully that screening was good enough)! a+ for customer service on returns with receipts over 30 days!"
3-star,0,"so uh yeah they sell sporting goods here. they have a great selection and the store is really nice (it's 2 stories) and the sales men don't bother you to much. i like the store but the prices are about average, which really doesn't make it special in my book."
5-star,1,"so, i was looking to get a yoga mat, and thought that dicks would be a great place to go to get something like that. i know this location is brand new, as i used to live right near it, and literally watched them build it from the ground up. this location has amazing hours! open late most nights, and is right off the expressway. you cant miss it! its in the same district as ikea, off the i-10. anyways, this place is well lit, has a ton of parking, and is so well organized its not even funny. not a thing was out of place. it has two floors, and carries a ton of stuff. i cruised through the womens section of clothing, and they have shoes, running stuff, you name it, its there! i was able to find the yoga mats, and they had a little selection in the back of the store. did i mention this place is really well lit? anyways, they had a small variety of mats. they also had a beginner mat set, that came with a video, a block and a yoga strap. 25 bucks! most of the mats i saw were about 20 bucks alone, so for the extra 5 bucks, i sprug for the extras. i think i got a pretty good deal. while i was wandering around, a staff member asked if there was anything i needed. just talked to him for a minute about yoga mats, and he said that was the only spot in the store that they would be at. seemed to know his stuff. i really like dick's sporting goods. well organized, amazing hours, well lit, friendly staff. i will return in the future!"
1-star,0,"this is one of the few dick sporting good location but has poor service. are used to be a regular customer this location after getting burned several times with poor service i have switch stores. dick's sporting goods is one of my favorite companies and i will continue to shop there. location at south park, which is the flagship store, is excellent. pineville location is also superior. unfortunately the matthew location is just not hitting all cylinders"
1-star,0,"usual dicks made a full lap around the store without making eye contact with a single employee. 4/19/15 - 7:15- 7:40. dang they suck just like my last review of dicks gastonia. same issues, just piss poor."
1-star,0,"terrible customer service at this location. can never find anyone to wait on us and when we finally do, they have no product knowledge what so ever. sad."
1-star,0,i was really excited to order a kayak from them ordering it was fine. they didnt have the one i needed in stock so i had the store order it for me. they said that it would take two weeks to get there which was good bc summer is here. i called when they said it would be ready and they said it wasnt in. i called every week for several weeks asking if it was in. they kept telling me not on this truck call back. finally when it had been a month i called again and they told me that when i ordered it was out of stock and they had to get it from a manufacturer which takes longer and it would be in next week. now its summer and no kayak. i think that the people in this store have no clue what they are talking about and they all seem like they really dont care. still waiting for my kayak after it comes in i will not be back into the store again.
1-star,0,"this dick's used to have excellent customer service. i don't know what changed, but they don't any more. in fact, the people who work there are now kind of... ok, well, perhaps that joke is a little too obvious. seriously, though. i don't care how much cool stuff you have or how awesome your sales are. if i ask you if you have a shoe in a certain size and you answer ""probably not"" and walk away without even looking at me, i won't be buying anything from your store. well, i suppose this is why they invented zappos."
3-star,0,"i come here every once in a while to pick up some sports items. mostly tennis balls and some fitness gear/clothing. this place is rather large and expansive, offering a lot of selections in shoes, brand names, gear for the popular sports... so get ready to walk around a bit if you are shopping around or looking for something specific. my last visit here wasn't particularly great. it seemed like the store was undergoing a re-organization so there was a whole section that was in disarray and/or moving somewhere else. the staff that work here seem to be mostly high-school students... you get what you pay for i guess.... they can be helpful at times, but sometimes they can be wrapped up in their own work-life dramas and interpersonal relationships. this is just by observation as i saw these two girl cashiers gossiping about one of the other employees or the managers while i waited in line for forever."
3-star,0,"i don't often find my way to sporting goods stores. it's probably because we have so much stuff already. so when i end up at dick's, it is because i'm looking for something specific. but this place is so large, i usually need help finding it. sure, they have sections where you can narrow your search, but you'll often need help really getting down to the nitty-gritty. that's where it can be problematic. it's like the old problem of having everything in the world - where would you put it? that's the issue here. they have all sorts of stuff, and have (apparently) figured out where to put it. you just can't find it. and often, you can't find someone to help you find it. if you do, you're typically okay."
4-star,1,"we came in today, a saturday afternoon, even with an appointment we had to wait for a little while. it was packed! i was lucky again to find a dress! but this time a bridal reception dress! :) much thanks to karla who looked after me! i was fixated on a certain style and sure enough the last dress karla brought was the exact opposite.... and i said yes to that dress! thank you david's bridal! my wedding party and i definitely recommend this location. unfortunately, our experience with the eglinton location was not as pleasant."
5-star,1,this was my 2nd visit to a bridal store and i still wasn't sure what i wanted but i did know it had to fit my small budget. luckily i had a talented and patient consultant maria working with me. she listened to my needs and pulled styles i would never think of but looked good on me! and even better it fit my budget. i would definitely recommend maria and the rest of the team at david's bridal for anyone else that's going dress shopping.
5-star,1,"i was here with my best friend and next bride. we didn't have an appointment as we walked in when they had just opened. they were kind enough to find us a consultant anyways. we lucked out! my bride had no clue and i mean 0 idea as to what style what theme she was going for. rachel was our consultant. she met us with a huge smile and an awesome attitude. even though we had an i don't know attitude. by process of elimination through questions and observations rachel brought us 2 dresses to try. from there on it was more of like putting together the perfect man. i like this part of this and that part of that. through the whole process rachel was super patient and super helpful. her smile and awesome attitude never faltered. down to the end we were stuck between 2. the bride basically was saying if they could only put this on here and do this to this one. rachel found a way to get brad pitt and orlando bloom meshed together, confirmed with alterations tailor and boom! we have the dress! she said yes! if you're getting married, looking for a dress and feel like you don't know where to get started this is definitely somewhere to start and the service, you just can't go wrong."
1-star,0,"i had an extremely mediocre experience trying on wedding dresses here and that mediocrity descended into deplorable when it came to alterations. david's has some nice dresses but the associates rush you into ordering and don't seem very happy when you ask to try on some different styles (i tried on about 5 and she seemed a bit annoyed). at this point the service was on par with my expectations, being a big box store. you get what you pay for. i decided to let them alter my dress, figuring they'd do a decent job since they've done so many of the same style. it ended up costing nearly as much as my dress, which i could've lived with if it weren't for the lazy quality of work and rudeness i faced from the seamstress. she used two bra inserts to create a faux push up insert that looked strange and felt uncomfortable (she didn't even bother hiding them inside the dress so you could literally see them from the side when i'm wearing it). when i told her that the top of the dress was too tight, she insisted nothing more could be done. overall she was extremely defensive and dismissive about any concerns i had. isn't that the whole point of the final fitting though? to get all the tweaks right?? all she wanted was my signature acknowledging that her work was done. i ended up going to a local seamstress who was able to fix this mess for me and i severely regret not doing so in the first place."
5-star,1,"great service and kindest workers. i was buying my prom dress and the women who i wish i remembered her name helped me through it all, whenever i needed something like beads, shoes etc she would run to get them and help me out! can't explain by amazing service and defiantly would recommend for both prom/random dresses and wedding dresses! soooo grateful for their service!"
4-star,1,"david's bridal was the first of four stores that i visited this past week for my gown hunting adventure with my family (who flew in specifically for the purpose of helping me find the dress i will get married in). i don't think it's fair to write a review on a bridal store based on whether or not it is the location where i will purchase my bridal gown, so i am going to focus on the dresses themselves, the service, the prices, and any other tidbits that may be interesting for brides-to-be (and in some cases, members of the bridal party as well). my hope is that my review will help you make an informed decision about whether or not this store is worth visiting during your own bridal gown adventure. pro: for each style of gown, they have a wide range of sizes ready to try on, so you don't have to squeeze yourself into a sample size if you're a bit bigger or find yourself swimming in a too-large gown if you're on the petite side. it makes it easy to see what the gown will actually look like on you once ordered. con: having multiple sizes per gown means that there aren't as many different styles available as it appears when you first walk into the store. once i had narrowed down exactly what i was looking for in a dress in terms of look and details, i only ended up with about 6 gowns that really fit my criteria in the entire store. pro: they have everything you could possibly need to picture yourself as you will look on your wedding day. don't have the right bra? they'll supply one for you to use during your visit. didn't bring shoes? no problem! curious how a necklace will look with your #1 choice gown? go ahead and try one on! con: it's easy to get overwhelmed by the sheer amount of bridal stuff in front of you and forget that the dress has to come first, and the details can come later. pro: plenty of decent sized dressing rooms (with my name and wedding date posted on the door for a personalized touch) with plenty of mirrors and space to marvel at how good you look in a wedding gown (go ahead and ogle). con: there were no apple boxes/platform to stand on! i didn't even know what i was missing until i arrived at the next bridal store on my list! as a 5'2"" woman who will undoubtedly have to shorten whatever dress i end up getting, i feel like i didn't get to see the dress in as good a light as possible. maybe they had boxes somewhere and i should have asked to be elevated when trying on the gowns? it was my first stop and i didn't really think to request this. pro: my budget was around $1000 before alterations (with the willingness to go over if it was the absolute perfect dress for me) and i think everything i pulled that i loved was $1000 or under. even a couple of the white by vera wang dresses i grabbed were still within my budget. you have a very good chance of finding something that fits both you and your wedding budget. con: less expensive dresses do equal less expensive details and features (for the most part). that being said, my favourite gown ($1000 on the nose) was stunning, and featured delicate bead-work and fabric that felt good on my skin. as well, the vera wang dresses had very luxurious fabrics that were beautiful, yet affordable. pro: my consultant paige was very helpful, and answered any and all questions that i had. she took my measurements and saved my size and favourite dress style into their system in the event that i decide to go back later and purchase my gown at david's. there was never any pressure to buy that day, and since we had a bit of extra time left in my appointment slot once i finished trying on dresses, paige indulged my desire to see my sister in some bridesmaid dresses and continued to assist us well after i was back in my street clothes. as well, i was delighted to learn that they were cool with us taking pictures of our favourite choices (watching too much say yes to the dress made me think that photos in a bridal store were a huge no-no), and those photos were actually incredibly helpful in my decision making process. con: no cons about paige. she was great and made me feel important and beautiful. but as a warning to other brides: i visited david's at 2:00pm on a thursday. there were only a couple of other customers in the store which made for the ideal shopping experience. if you go on an evening or weekend, i imagine this place gets quite harried and i wouldn't be surprised if each consultant had to help more than one bride at a time. if you can, try to go on a weekday morning or afternoon so you can be the center of your consultants attention. tl;dr conclusion: you can go in with almost any budget and find something you'll be proud to call yours on your wedding day. if you want to keep shopping simple, this store can easily be your one-stop shop for all your bridal and bridal party needs."
5-star,1,"i had an amazing experience at the david's bridal in mississauga. i went in after having two underwhelming experiences at other stores in windsor (where i'm from). i went with friends, then i went with family...big mistake. everyone has an opinion about something and just want to put you in a dress they want. ladies, if you are paying for the dress yourself...you are entitled to go by yourself & make the decision on your own. the consultants are there to help you find a dress that works best for you & your body shape. so i went there quietly on my own on a rainy wednesday morning. my sales girl, telma...was nothing short of amazing. get this girl a raise!!!! her knowledge, passion & guidance of all things bridal was obvious throughout the whole appointment. she pulled a vera wang dress for me and it was 'the one'. it was nothing that i'd ever expect to see myself in or even fall in love with, but she had a good feeling about it. the manager lynette came out and made me feel even more confident that this was my dress. they both reassured my doubts with that extra dose of confidence that i needed. after the first appointment i came back 2 days later to order it. yes, the bell ceremony is odd but kind of sweet. you do have the option of not doing it if you're uncomfortable. also paying for the dress upfront is also kind of annoying but understandable. this is a chain store with lots of inventory so they have to keep things moving. it's not a bridal 'boutique' where they can hold your dress for months at a time. you get it, have your moment and go! all in all, a very pleasant experience at db. i'll be happy to return for my alterations once my dress arrives :)"
2-star,0,"david's bridal is really just a bridal/wedding factory. it churns things in and out at a lower cost. i don't think that's a surprise to anyone, nonetheless, you can still be the best at what you do and how you do it. i just don't think they're the best. the selection just looks cheap. you can be inexpensive and still have a quality look. their staff also seem complacent. my biggest issue was that i got measured for my bridesmaid dress by their staff and the dress came in too small. 2 inches too small! i went into the store and they were able to zip it up at the cost of my lungs. they then said that i was ""inbetween sizes"". why would you order the smaller size then if i'm in between? i also find that they never answer their phone the first time. i usually have to call 3 times in a row to actually speak with someone. once, i was even put on hold for over 10 minutes. i hung up and called back to talk to a new csr. i'll never go back - unless another friend decides to go for her wedding."
4-star,1,"first store i decided to visit and had an enjoyable experience. i went on a thursday afternoon so the place was empty and i had lots of time to look around. they have a good selection of affordable beautiful gowns and were able to accommodate my short timeframe (4 months). the consultant i had was friendly and helpful. i didn't find ""the one"" here but it did hold a close second! my only negatives are the lighting isn't the best -- made the ivory dresses look yellow, and i didn't think the seamstress was as knowledgeable as she portrayed. she was quick to say yes to any of my requests (adding sleeves and a higher neckline) but wanted to use scraps instead of suggesting i purchase the material myself. i wasn't thrilled about the idea of patch work on my wedding gown. i'm sure she is great with your typical fitting but for those brides that may need a bit more than the typical l would choose another seamstress."
4-star,1,"i went to david's bridal for my wedding dress a few weeks ago. i was immediately greeted and me and my group were escorted to a dressing room with chairs set up and a little heart sticky note on the door with my name and wedding date (cute!) the saleswoman (xeni) was very helpful - especially considering i had no idea what i wanted. she brought me many different dresses until we finally narrowed it down. when i had gotten down to two dresses, she brought out veils and tiaras for me to try and complete the look. when i chose my dress there was a ritual to follow with some kind words from the store manager about my special day and a bell ringing ceremony. a little odd for someone shy like me, but still sweet. the only downside was having to pay for the entire dress cost up front, but understandable. i liked that when i told her my budget, she did not give me dresses above the cost to try make a bigger sale. overall i had a great experience!"
1-star,0,"david's bridal is a total joke. out of all the places i've been this is the worst place you can go. you do not feel special here, you are just another 'number'. i've been twice now... hoping the way they treat customers is just a fluke... but sadly it seems to be their way. they had me scheduled for an appt at 2:30 and no one came to help me until 3:15.... i was about to walk out the door. my mother, sister and best friend were all in shock by the poor customer service... the ladies standing around at the front counter are useless... and have quite an attitude on them. i actually found a dress i love there but am super reluctant to purchase it from them because of the service i had. i am going to try and find it elsewhere. my advice to you if you are going dress shopping.. go anywhere else, because i guarantee you will be robbed of the 'special' feeling you should get while dress shopping. my advice to david's bridal is to book less appts, have customer service and take the time to care about your customers. if i could go on forever about them i would.. cuz i have about 20 stories where i was treated horribly (btw i am not a diva.. just a normal gal trying to find a nice dress)"
1-star,0,"i would give it 1/2 a star if i could.. if you're looking for a relaxing, comfortable dress shopping experience, do not go to david's bridal. the staff is extremely rude and they do not listen to their customer's needs. i booked an appointment to try on a few dresses a couple months ago and did not have a good experience. the lady that helped me did not smile once and wasn't very helpful at all. it just seemed like she didn't want to be there and acted miserable the whole time. that alone turned me right off and made me feel extremely uncomfortable. but what topped it off was the customer service on the phone. they talk to you as if you're inconveniencing them! so bottom line, if you're looking for a good wedding dress shopping experience, go to a small boutique and avoid the big box stores like david's bridal, because they are not personable and do not care about anything but making a sale. if you're looking for a walmart experience, then maybe david's bridal is for you. good day"
5-star,1,"denise is very talented, wonderful to work with and very friendly. with her italy design school background, she can envision what will accentuate your features and look best on you. the moment i walked into the store, she picked a dress for me. best selection by far of any special occasion dress you may want. i tried on numerous mother of the bride dresses from many stores and ultimately went with the dress she picked out. she redesigned the neckline of the dress to make it flattering for me and spent countless hours doing the alterations by hand. with all the work it entailed, she had the dress ready to go in plenty of time. she goes above and beyond to help her customers look their best. received many compliments on the dress. i will definitely be back for future special occasion dresses. karen g."
5-star,1,"denise is amazing, she went above and beyond to help my daughter find the perfect dress! she even went out of her way to order her a dress last minute and worked late to complete the alterations! we love her and will go back for every special occasion."
5-star,1,she has the best selection in scottsdale. the most unique and flattering dresses. i found my rehearsal dinner dress here and am still in love with it in all of the photos. denise is also really honest. she won't let you buy anything that she doesn't think looks absolutely fabulous. she won't stop until you find something amazing!
1-star,0,"originally, i gave designer studio a great review because my daughter and i loved the dress selection, and the owner, denise was very friendly and accommodating. unfortunately i will have to change my review to one star. the reason i am changing the rating is because i don't want anyone else to go through the same traumatic and disappointing experience as my daughter and me. my daughter picked out a prom dress from designer studio that she loved and was very excited to wear. when we tried the dress on, however, the zipper came open in the back after it was zipped repeatedly. denise said not to worry, that she would reinforce the zipper and alter the length so that it wasn't an issue on prom night. we left the dress with her for at least a month. she never called to let us know the dress was ready, so we followed up ourselves. my daughter picked up her dress and was so excited to wear it to prom. we had put hours and hours into finding the right dress, and it was perfect for her. unfortunately, the night of prom, about 20 minutes before her date was to pick her up, the zipper again split up the back. we tried to zip it at least three times, and it would go up and stay put for a few minutes but then eventually would split again. it wasn't that the dress was too tight...it fit perfectly and even had a little room but the zipper just wouldn't stay closed. we thought that the issue had been addressed properly, but apparently not. my daughter was in tears and so incredibly disappointed. we didn't know what to do. luckily, her older sister had a dress from a couple years ago that just happened to fit perfectly. even though my younger daughter didn't like her sister's dress and was incredibly disappointed about her own dress she rallied and left the house ready to put this behind her. i called denise to let her know what had happened and she was surprised, as according to denise the company that makes the dress usually doesn't have any issues. i told her i was sure that was true but we did have an issue. she said she would give me a store credit and i told her i would bring the dress back in. i thought about it after our conversation, and after thinking about her offer for store credit felt strongly that she should have offered a refund. after all, it was months of planning and she said she had fixed the zipper issue, and the night of prom my daughter couldn't even wear the dress! when i brought the dress back in denise was very nice at first until i asked for a refund. i explained why i thought a refund was appropriate. denise pulled at the zipper pretty hard several times and since it didn't come undone when she was pulling it she said that even though she believed that there had been a problem the night of the event that since the zipper was not coming undone when she pulled it she could not refund my money. i told her i had no idea why it wasn't coming undone but that it had very definitely split up the back several times the night of prom and wasn't wearable. she said i'm sorry, i can't refund you. when i said (and i was angry at this point, this entire scenario seemed very wrong) that i would just take a store credit she then told me i could only have $100 credit toward another dress next year! the dress i bought cost $565. so not only would she not refund me, she wouldn't even give me a store credit worth the price of the dress! i was extremely angry at this point and basically told denise i own a business as well and would never treat a customer this way. i also said i would have been a repeat customer if this had been handled fairly and i had been refunded. i truly would have been. so maybe she would have had to refund one dress, but then had the sale of several dresses many years down the line due to a satisfied customer. i go to many events each year where a formal dress is required. so now denise has lost me as a customer forever, and i will not hesitate to make everyone i know aware of the very poor customer service here. denise is very, very nice and accommodating unless there is a problem, but then watch out if there is an issue. save yourself the risk and go elsewhere."
5-star,1,i was having a very difficult time deciding on a dress to wear to my daughter's wedding. a week before the wedding i decided i hated the dress i had decided to purchase so i was out relooking. i stumbled upon designer studio in the shops at gainey village. denise picked a stunning dress for me. she altered it four days so i could wear it the day of the wedding. i looked and felt beautiful. thank you denise for being you!
5-star,1,"not sure if anyone knows this....dollar tree is essentially an internet company. there is no ability to contact therir corporate offices. good luck trying to get a hold of the dm. unavailable at all times. dollar tree corporation has no idea how badly there dm's and above are a complete waste of money with absolutely no accountability. now, the store managers are busting their butts with little to no help from their dm. the store managers are what makes the store work in spite of the lack of concern from their dms. hats off to the backbone of dollar tree (their store managers). there is something extremely wrong with this corporation. i dug a little deeper in an effort to file a complaint with dollar tree reference some issues with how employees were treated during a recent store move. guess what, the contact number provided lead to a phone tree and voice mail. considering there are several products from china, one has to wonder if this is a front company???????"
5-star,1,great place with great prices on many name brand grocery items. my problem is i usually leave with more items than i was shopping for! the grocery items are unbelievable since all items are $1.00.
5-star,1,"love dollar tree. it is my go to store when i need reading glasses, batteries, water, candy :), etc. i enjoy going up and down the aisles and seeing what's new...there's always something."
5-star,1,"am i tight w/my money? yes. yes, i am at times. where do i go to stretch my money the most? dollar tree. why? because everything is $1.00. but, you do have to be smart too. i've seen name brand hand soap in there for $1, but have seen this same brand at walmart for 87 cents. so, i do believe that there is some trickery going on here. i can buy 24-count tylenol pm (well, generic canadian stuff) here as well as christmas wrapping paper, bows, nametags, etc. all for one dollar, folks. i would have probably paid double if not triple at target or walmart for this sort of stuff. some of their shelf-stable food scares me a little. i see lots of dented/bent stuff made in china that has labels in . just be careful as you may end up w/a case of botulism."
5-star,1,"yep! one of the best dollar trees in the phoenix metro area! i have been to the dollar tree in chandler, on via linda in scottsdale, the one by pv mall, and another one in hancock plaza in pv/phoenix. this dollar tree is by far the cleanest, most organized, and well kept store. the staff is very helpful and friendly and i have never ever had a problem with this location. they also seem to have the items i need in stock. their food items are the freshest too."
5-star,1,"this dollar tree (dt) location in fountain hills is the best one out of the lot. i don't normally go to dollar trees because the selection is so bad, but when i'm taking the 87 to shea into scottsdale, i make sure i stop by this location in fountain hills for the small necessities, like greeting cards, wrapping paper, and even makeup. i really like their plastic boxes for organizational purposes. i've bought food (like jam and cookies) also from this location, and have had no problems. this dt location is very clean, and well kempt, which is unlike any other dt location. the staff, particularly an elderly lady, is really nice and helpful. i highly recommend this location over the others for values."
3-star,0,"this is the most organized and cleanest dollar store that i've been to! in the gift aisles, all of the gifts were neatly placed on the shelves. all of the similar items were even grouped together (example: all of the rubber duckies were together). now that is a lot or organization! it was fun to go through the greeting cards and all of the aisles. this store has a lot more products in stock! store hours: sunday: 10am - 7pm monday - saturday: 8am - 9pm"
5-star,1,the staff in this store are awesome. beth and sarah are truly the best. they do everything to make their customer happy. i live here in vegas and shop at donald pliner in the forum shops all the time the selection is great
5-star,1,"the store is located at the forum shops at caesar's palace. the space is well organized. i am a big fan of donald j pliner shoes and they make up most of my closet. the shoes can be expensive so i only buy them on sale. at the store you can frequently get sale items at an additional 50% off. a bonus from buying at the store is free shipping. i was in vegas, bought a couple of pairs and had them shipped to seattle great shoes, great prices, super friendly staff."
5-star,1,"so...i used to be a purse girl. i feel like most of us ladies are either purse girls or shoe girls.... now here comes my problem. after visiting donald pliner the last few times in vegas i am officially a purse and shoe girl. something's gotta give and it is probably gonna be my bank account! i met my new besties on a flight home from vegas and have since traveled back in the last few months with them a couple of times. where did they take me you ask? well to donald pliner for shoes of course. they are big fans and also knew my shoe collection was sad at best. first stop after the flight in is the donald pliner store for a look at the new styles as well as sale items with my favorite sales associate debra. when i say favorite, i mean out of all the stores i frequent. she always greets me with a smile and has my shopping habits, likes, dislikes stored in the system so when i say ""did i like these last time?"" she can honestly tell me yes or no. debra and everyone else there are friendly and provide awesome service. we tend to try on about 20-30 pairs of shoes when we are there and never a complaint! i also like that i tend to stay in the sale range and there is never judgement on the price point i am at (i know there should not be judgement, but sometimes at the high end stores in vegas that is exactly what happens). they have all kinds of fabulous boots as well as heels. my feet are very sensitive so i really never wear heels but this store introduced me to a stack heel. this type of heel more evenly distributes the weight load over the ball and heel of your feet, leading to a much more comfortable shoe. i have walked up and down the strip for miles in one pair. instead of having to wear my tennis shoes i can wear a cute pair of shoes with my outfit while getting in my walk! my strappy stack heels are my favorite addition to my ever growing shoes collection! the most recent visit a couple of days ago, i brought my husband and they happily sedated him with a beverage and cookies so i could do my shopping. there was a dj playing live music which was a nice touch to the shopping experience. thank you to donald pliner and debra for such an awesome, customized shoe buying experience. you have changed my perspective on shoes for life!"
4-star,1,"i think the associates assumed we weren't going to buy anything and were ignoring us until they could tell we were actually interested in making a purchase. after that they were amazing. some of the shoes are completely impractical, but mr. j found the most amazing pair of grey/red dress shoes with a matching belt. he's extremely pleased with them and will probably purchase again in the future. i wouldn't buy shoes here (my size is harder to find) but i will drool over what mr. j calls ""the shiny"" while he conducts business. so much shiny! also, the collection of masks in the store is amazing. i loved the aesthetics of the place."
5-star,1,"this is a review of pliner's approach and style (truly original, but certainly ""not for everyone,) this location, and especially their sales person - milijana, or mia as she introduced herself. making my purchase on 12/18 during their holiday sale i literally tried on 25 pairs of shoes before making my final selection - a half-lacquered pair of black suede shoes unlike anything i've previously seen. while the store did not have my size in stock, mia brought me shoes made from the same mold and informed me that not only could the size i need (11) be mailed to my home, but it could be accomplished with no tax and free shipping since i lived in ohio. in retrospect i wish i'd have bought more pairs of shoes while i was there, but as it stands they've guaranteed i'll return on my next vegas visit."
3-star,0,"ok, so what am i -- a guy -- writing up donald pliner for? well, yeah, they do have some men's shoes, but that's not why we were there. i say ""we"" because my wife lynn (aka imelda) has a thing for donald pliner shoes. while in hawaii, she picked up an opalescent turtle-like leather show with a metal heel that was -- well, you get (or most of you get) the idea . . . so, being the wonderful, charming, and faithful husband i am, i told her that donald pliner had a store here . . . . wonderful shoes, but low inventory (""we're out of that one in your size"") and several pairs that should have been comfortable but weren't and -- well, you get the idea. i think she'll still be buying them at nordie's."
5-star,1,"we've been here quite a few times and no issues. people are helpful, but not too excessive, which is good. we bought my husband's business shoes and those are my favorite shoes over the ones i got off groupon. they carry brands that are nice looking, reasonably priced, and comfortable to walk in. he preferred the men's dress shoes here over that of macy's and the more expensive department stores which were usually more than double and some even triple the price for about the same look and less comfort. my son bought his 8th grade graduation shoes here. we couldn't find the right size, but the sales associate helped us and was able to locate the shoes in the right size in a different area of the store. the store is neat, organized every time we have gone in. no complaints of any type here. oh, we've also done returns, exchanges and no issues with those either. the checkout process is easy, too."
4-star,1,not a very good selection of shoes especially when it's buy one get one half off but they had what i wanted the customer service was great and it being a holiday sale it was surprisingly slow good for me
1-star,0,"horrible customer service provided by the manager michelle at this location.. gilbert, crossroads. i wanted this really cute pair of puma tennis shoes, teal and grey. i found sveral of the same pairs of puma shoes priced differently. the size 6 1/ 2 was priced at 30.00, and the size 7 priced at 75.00 . i spoke with 2 different assocites, one girl with dark back short hair, and the gentleman, both associates stated they would give me the size 7s for 30.00. when the dark haired girl rang up the size 7 pumas, they rang up for 60.00. not 30, not 75.00. the girl stated, she will still give them to me for 30.00 since all of that particular shoe is marked wrong. the associate was unauthorized to process the override.. when the manager michelle came over, she rang up both shoes, they both came up with different prices, and told me i would have to pay 60.00 for the size 7 shoe i wanted. i advised her all of the same shoes on the clearance rack are marked differently. she stated someone missed marked them. michelle stated i could have the size 6 1/2 for the price it was marked which was 30.00. i advised her that 2 of her associates said i would pay 30.00.. the manager michelle didnt care.. i told her that she lost my business .. i will never shop at famous footwear. . horrible customer service provided by the manager michelle at the gilbert location at crossroads.. i ended up going accross the street to shoe carnival and bought 4 pairs of shoes.. btw, the managers name was michelle..."
1-star,0,"i haven't been able to find a pair of black heels for a very long time. within 10 minutes of walking into the store, i immediately found what i was looking for. not only it is pretty, it is also comfy. i can't wait to break it in. shoe boxes were definitely well organized. i could find different shoe sizes in different color easily. the lady who worked here last night was very friendly (at first). however, this is where the store started to lose my 5 star. first of all, the credit card machine is incredibly slow at reacting, but very quick to kick you out if you don't hit the button fast enough. it was very frustrating. secondly, the lady told us that if we paid money towards charity, we would get an additional 15% discount. while i was waiting for the machine to react, i actually found the 15% discount coupon on my phone app. it took the machine another few minutes to react to this change and redo the whole thing again. after everything was said and done, she still guilt trip me by saying ""are you sure you don't want to donate money to help out the children? "" have u guys seen the recent south park show when the cashier tried to shame the customer at the whole food store? that was how she made me feel. when it was my friends turned to pay, i simply walked out from the store waiting for him. especially when i pulled up the 15% coupon for his separate purchase from the website, and she refused to use it saying that the machine probably wouldn't take it. then, she pressure him to give donation just like she did to me in order to get his 15% discount (when i had a coupon for him too & it is advertise on their website and yelp app. i didn't feel like arguing with her non sense and left. the entire check out process took about 10 minutes. i was not happy at that point. nevertheless, i'm glad to walk out with a pair of shoes that i like...and if i come back next time, i will probably bring cash."
1-star,0,i walked into this store and there were 2 other women who walked in before me. they got greeted and helped. i was 2 rows away. i walked to the seat to try on a pair of shoes as i was tying the shoes i was going to purchase well the sale associates a young man and young lady stood there talking. i never once was ask can i help you...i'm in plain view. i walked around still haven't been greeted. he walked right by me he actually looked in my direction. i wanted a pair of tennis shoes but since i wasn't acknowledged. i put my shoes back and heading for the door. a lady walked in and got greeted...really? i suggest you retrain your sale associates in customer service. i really don't like playing the racist card. but i am a african american all the other customers that were greeted were caucasian....they may not been aware of what happened and how it looked...but not a good look for your establishment. i was a customer but for now on i will purchase my shoes at some other famous footwear
1-star,0,"pretty disappointed at this place the girl who was working there was pretty rude and has lots of attitude, her name was brie i believe. was not helpful at all...not a friendly face, lots of attitude!! i think she realized how rude she was at the end of my visit so she managed to fake a smile and say have a good day. but i left without buying because she was just rude! i would put negative stars but there's no such option."
1-star,0,"this company in general is really bad. my family has purchased several pairs of higher end sneakers here, our jobs make us go through pairs really fast, but after this past experience we will never go back. i purchased a pair that were defective, i went to exchange them they didn't have the size so they ordered them to come to the store within one week...which turned into a month no shoes no money back customer service wouldn't send me a email to confirm return of money, they refused, finally i got the check it was sent to the store where i had to make a special trip to pick it up... very frustrated i do not recommend this company."
5-star,1,"fine points is far more than a yarn/clothing/jewelry boutique with the best selection of everything at competitive prices! liz tekus the owner is one of the nicest, kindest, most helpful people on planet earth! over the years we have become friends and when i had cancer two years ago she was genuinely concerned and presented me with a beautiful bracelet. just last week i was at the obx and realized i had forgotten my pattern book and i called her and she emailed me the directions in 10 minutes! liz and all the people working at fine points are incredible knitters and fiber artists and so generous with their time to help you learn anything you need to know. i have gone there with chunks of my hair torn out in frustration and they have straightened out my issues and sent me on my way! the last thing i have to say is that if you need inspiration for a project...just stop by the shop because liz has tons of items made up that you can hardly decide what to make next! i should mention that i have a masters degree in fiber/weaving from tyler school of art in philadelphia and have been to more than my fair share of yarn stores over the last 45 years to compare this shop to!"
5-star,1,warm setting and atmosphere. amazing selection of yarns that are unique. perfect for serious knitters as well as beginners. you can also find other boutique items there. a great spot in he cleveland area to shop and dine.
5-star,1,"fine points was one of the first places i knew in cleveland hts, and from the beginning, it has helped me make my home in this area. the quality of yarn is terrific, and there are always knitted goods hanging up inside, stimulating creativity and fun. i have also bought a third of my wardrobe from the clothing boutique upstairs. at this point, heather, who helps manage the boutique, knows my body shape and size and makes the best recommendations--it's almost as if she buys for me! yet generally speaking, i have always been treated well by the witty, creative, and warm women who work in this store. my knitting has grown a lot in the past few years because they are always willing to help me learn a new technique, or solve a strange problem in a pattern. in fact, with a very badly written pattern, by the time i got advice, at least five women in the store had tried to figure it out! i love how full of character and personality that green house of a store is, especially during a long, gray cleveland winter. i often come when i need to get away from work or the blues, and it's like entering a different world. yes, things may feel pricey, but i tell myself that i am investing in quality, creativity, care, and community. this is for knitting, clothing, and good company. this ain't no fast-food kind of place. good things take time, and it's especially worth it when local. many friends from out of town have been taken to fine points, and they always remark on how well treated we are."
3-star,0,"wall to wall yarn, but cluttered and dark. while there is a reasonable selection of yarns, nothing is priced. it's uncomfortable to keep asking the price of each yarn that i would consider for a project. after asking the price of 4 yarns, i finally left empty handed. if they did a little dusting, organizing and pricing ... this yarn store could be worth the trip."
2-star,0,"fantastic (and i mean fantastic) selection of brand/colors. but the store comes across as snobbish, and there are no prices marked anywhere. you have to take your purchases to a clerk and have them look up the prices on everything. not the way i want to browse. also, the place is so stuffed full that you cannot turn around or touch anything without mounds of yarn cascading to the floor. i also had a gift card, and the clerk ringing me out spent 10 minutes trying to get it to work and still couldn't."
4-star,1,"i would be giving this store 5 stars, but i felt like the woman running it were knitting snobs and not very eager to help us. it almost got 5 stars because it is wall to wall yarn. amazing yarn. any yarn that i would be looking for is in this place and i picked up some really unique looking stuff and i wish i had some projects specifically in mind so i could've bought more!!!"
1-star,0,"raven and the 2 men working tonight need to get a new job. 1. when i ask which adidas shoes are for running ""whichever are comfortable is ok"" raven is not an appropriate answer. 2. i don't want to hear about it being almost closing time blah blah blah. if there were my employees i would fire them asap. 3. the said hi, clearly i wanted to hug a few pairs of shoes i asked for these adidas sandles in a man's size why does raven not know how to convert womens size to men's shoe size ? she tried her hardest to discourage a sale tonight so i as a business owner and the owner of a non profit would advise you to fire this lot who worked on tuesday night and only cared about going home and closing shop. never will i spend an ounce of my money there. i'm disgusted by the lack of service or care and lack of knowledge. no wonder this place has 2 stars."
1-star,0,"the staff seemed unmotivated and i had to walk around with a display shoe to get somebody to retrieve my size. the store is run by unmotivated millenials. of course, they didn't have my shoe size. i had to order my size at the counter but could barely hear myself speak because the mumble rap is played so loudly. i was told that my shoes would take 3-5 business days to arrive and that i would be contacted. after day 6, i called the 800 number and discovered my shoes were delivered within 2 days but nobody called me. when i returned to the store to pick up my brand new shoes, i saw that they were used."
1-star,0,"the customer service was terrible at this location. we walked in and there were 5 workers who didn't say anything to us. i was waiting at the shoe wall to be helped. finally, i asked the guy closest to me for a shoe. he turned to the other two male workers and said hey can you get this size? both of the guys didn't seem to want to help us at all and it was like we were inconveniencing them. one of the guys was messing around on his cell phone which i find to be extremely poor customer service. at this point i was so annoyed and we decided to do our business elsewhere."
5-star,1,i came to downtown summerlin footlocker and luis and galyn did their absolute best to help me get the right exchange for my shoe !!
2-star,0,nice ambience in store. very good selection. knocked down in stars because they wouldn't honor the lower price for the same item advertised at finish line. right! i always like paying foot locker's inflated prices for already overpriced shoes. finish line here i come.
1-star,0,"took my son last night to purchase shoes. it was black thursday, and there were at least a dozen employees working. however these employees were too busy chatting and shooting trash into the garbage can to bother greeting or actually assisting. after ten minutes i left with zero help and went to the vans store where the service was amazing and i purchased three pairs of shoes. foot locker has terrible associates who do not want to help anyone and are not concerned with selling anything. i will never return to this store again."
1-star,0,this place is a piece of shit i will never give my money to them ever!! i ordered some lebron james soldier 10 shoes for my son directly at the store and i was told that in 3-5 business days i would receive them.. no word no phone call from the store at all. i finally called the store to see wats up and they told me they canceled my order. i said why? they said oh that shoe is on backorder!! r u fukn kidding me? u couldn't call and tell me ? worst customer service!! then i call the corporate office and no one gives a shit . no help! nothin! never order from these assholes again!
1-star,0,"i purchased shoes online that did not work out. according to the online policy i could return them to a local store. when i brought them into the store, they said they needed to verify my credit card number with the online store before they could refund. they were on hold to speak to someone about this for about 1/2 an hour. it does not make sense to me to have someone wait for 1/2 an hour to verify a cc number. the last four did not appear anywhere on the receipt both electronic and hard copy receipt. my name, address and phone number was on the receipt which i had my id to verify. i really do not see why it matters to them how they refund the money as i do not go through this with other stores. i really feel they should change how they proceed. too much of a hassle to shop there anymore."
1-star,0,they get 1 star just because of the decent selection. the customer service was terrible. the woman assisting us seemed like she didn't want to be bothered and had an attitude problem. she didn't even try to help us.
1-star,0,selection is awesome but the customer service on other hand was horrible i try to flag down to employees and they just sped off then i verbally asked employee if i can get a size they told me give me a couple minutes which i understand so after 10 minutes i asked for them employee and i was told that they clocked out and they left for the day. which was a bummer because i actually sat there and waited for them
2-star,0,"embarrassed money was spent here . upon arrival i watch guests be greeted by a pair of associates attached at the hip who couldn't put away a healthy convo to fully crowd control or build any real warm welcomes. finally in a crowded store with plenty of payroll used i found my self wandering the store for a mirror to try on apparel and to my dismay none and none of that american customer service of five point guest augmentation. as a friend begged left and right for service or even to get full eye contact to grab a size,the ten plus sales staff seem to be no where in sight. can this be loss prevention approved? finally the shoe came out an asian dude who just could have cared less who had no product knowledge or passion could careless to make the sell stood there making one think am i bothering you? my bad!! i watched a store with ten people scurry around like ants but no leader to be found to give any direction. this is lv ! high volume your brand and demographic are here,so why is your customer service that of some santa ana factory outlet store? come on guys!!!"
1-star,0,good looking store but i believe the manager needs to be fired. i came in looking for a pair of jordan shoes for my boyfriend. inquired and asked questions. but i was ignored. he seemed to be getting some free things from some guys and had saved shoes for them. i thought this was unfair asked for the manger and he said he was it. i was told the hard to get shoes were either raffled and then first come first serve. i guess this doesn't apply to guys giving him things. i think this store is ran unethical and he is getting kickbacks for hard to get shoes. at least that is what i observed.
1-star,0,customer service is not good. am i invisible? watched at least 4 employees completely ignore me as i looked at shoes. even sat down and waited patiently for someone to help me. gave up- walked out- and as i was walking out someone asked if i needed something.
5-star,1,"this footlocker by far, surpasses my expectations in customer service and selection. tyler, who seems to be the current store manager, is extremely helpful, and funny! he was able to locate and ship the kobe vi rice to my boyfriend when they weren't available in store! he even let us in an hour early when the kobe vi chaos (jokers) came out! not only tyler is friendly, but there's also an older asian man that works at this location.i couldn't get close enough to read a name tag, or if he even has a name on his badge, but it surprises me every time i see him, he is always assisting a customer, and he's not afraid to drop some younger slang in there. (example: ""how' bout these kobe's. these just dropped yesterday! they're clean!"") haha, couldn't get over it, seeing as he has a very slight accent as well. anyway, this is the spot to hit, especially since niketown at the forum shops in caeser's palace is closed for renovations until may! they get all the new releases, in very limited amounts. tyler isn't scared to let you know way ahead of time of drop dates, too. so props to him, and this particular location."
4-star,1,"probably the best stocked foot locker in vegas, but can be a pain getting to since it's on the strip and a big mall to walk around. helpful salespeople and no problems with returns and exchanges."
1-star,0,the cashier leah was extremely rude and has a horrible personality. will not returning to this location. made us feel unwanted and was extremely unhelpful. i had an exchange and the tag was ripped as she then accused me of wearing it and would not exchange it. very disappointed. horrible experience.
1-star,0,i've been in much smaller forever 21 stores that had at least a limited plus size selection. absolute failure on the part of both management and corporate. was ready to spend several hundred dollars on clothes this evening - forever 21 did not just lose my business for this particular visit. i won't be visiting any of their stores in the near future.
1-star,0,the store is well cleaned and very organized but the staff here is extremely rude. they don't welcome or ask if you need any help. they act like it's an inconvenience when you come in trying to spend money. i would recommend going to fashion squares forever 21 since they have better staff.
1-star,0,terrible customer service at this location. very rude. will not be back. was very snotty about a return and there was nothing wrong with item. never worn and still had tags on it. just purchased it two weeks ago.
1-star,0,"after coming to this store on multiple occasions, i will not be returning. it's basically like no one works here unless you want to pay or get a dressing room. today there were only 2 girls actually working and the remainder of them were standing in a group talking not even bothering to look at the customers let alone ask them if they need help. during the last trip i took here i had to try on something and while my mother was waiting, she and the rest of us customers in the dressing rooms listened to two employees complain over their job and other coworkers and then actually started arguing and cussing at each other. i do believe my mother wrote a formal complaint on the forever21 website after this happened, but it looks like nothing has really changed."
1-star,0,i bought jewelry here on several occasions and both times it broke before i could even wear it. all of their jewelry is final sale so plan on having all the rhinestones fallout and pearls break away before you can even wear anything. i went to return but i didn't have a receipt and they wouldn't take it or exchange it one day later.
2-star,0,clean and well maintained store. i've been here several times and never have i been asked if i needed help or greeted. the employees just walk around acting like customers are invisible. twice i've needed help but didn't either bother asking for help since up at the register i always see the employees chatting away.
1-star,0,"this place has gone down hill, the store is so cluttered you can't even go through the clothes! the employees are rude, like you owe them something. sorry, jobs not that hard."
1-star,0,"i was blessed with 5 girls but absolutely hate shopping with them especially at this store. it is the most unorganized disaster. just thinking about it makes me dizzy. why in az did we vote to pay these kids $15 an hour? they are not helpful, they stand around and talk like it's a social hour and the store is a mess. it's like walking into a teenagers bedroom that hasn't been cleaned for a year. never the the less we finally found dresses for a wedding. i will be sticking to online shopping from now on or just sending the girls with my credit card. p.s. i set a timer and told the girls they have one hour, after that i'm leaving. the one star is for the crappy folding chairs by the dressing room you can sit in until you are finally ready to leave and pay for over priced clothes."
1-star,0,"this store has the worst customer service i have ever received. i gave it a one star for lack of a zero. i came in because after washing 2 blouses for my 15 year old daughter and following the instructions, they shrank at least a size smaller. all i asked of their very rude manager, robert was for an exchange to a larger size or a gift card. he however, wouldn't hear of it...all he said was that he couldn't help me because the shirts had been washed and tags removed. hello? where is this logic? of course they were washed, how else did i find out that they had shrank. i would have dropped the issue, but i thought it was so unfair to be treated this way. i'm out of $45 dollars and unfortunately, my daughter really loved the shirts. i called their customer service in a foreign country and was even more frustrated when even after speaking to a supervisor, they refused to offer me a resolution. keep in mind, i have a receipt and they were just purchased 2 weeks ago. i will never give this store my money, their prices are much higher than i remembered and the quality of their clothes, well, what can i say. buyer beware!!!!!"
1-star,0,"employees walk right by you and give you the stank look. no greetings, no welcome in. the racks are so full you can't even browse through the merchandise. there is more clothes and accessories on the ground then there is hung.. the fitting rooms are always crowded and the people tending them are always in a bad mood. oh do be careful when walking! there are loose tiles everywhere, so shoes tend to get stuck in them every so often! this store has potential but not with the people that work here. maybe also with some new tiles?... and some smiles?... customer service 101.."
1-star,0,"my 17 year old daughter and i walked into this location yesterday around 4 pm. there were three employees standing directly at the door, talking. not one bothered to greet us as we entered the store. so, we just walked through and out the other door to another store. oh, and they really need to do something about that cheap flooring. the pieces lift in various locations throughout the store. i've tripped and stubbed my toe during previous shopping visits. yesterday i noticed they'd finally used tacky, yellow forever 21 tape to try and hold them down. very nice. i'm not sure what's worse the dangerous flooring, or the rude employees."
5-star,1,"lots of great clothes. we went in for my daughter, and i ended up getting a few things - belts. definitely any not long dresses or skirts are way too short for a woman in her 40s. but, some really cute clothes and great prices. i would tend more towards some of the conservative stuff, but they seem to have a large selection of clothes, plenty of dressing rooms, and a great variety of things at reasonable prices. this was my first time going in. nice staff, too and not bothersome."
5-star,1,"this forever 21 is better in every way then the chandler location in the mall. both locations have good selection for women, but this location excels is customer service. everyone here is very friendly when at the chandler location everyone is miserable and acts inconvenienced when you ask for help. the parking is close. you can actually get cell phone service in this location where chandler you can't. clothes are pretty cheaply made, but you already know that if you have shopped here before. you get what you pay for."
4-star,1,"love this place! it's so organized, easy to shop! they would put a bowl of accessories to match your outfit in the same area."
1-star,0,"i came into this store after work on a tuesday evening and was not greeted as i walked in, there was only one other customer in the store. i browsed majority of the racks without a peep from any of the sales associates. i even helped myself into the dressing room, i walked out empty handed and was horrified at how bad the customer service is here. this was not my first experience!"
1-star,0,"went there on a monday morning. they had just opened and i was the only customer in the store. i was returning a new, unopened item while i attempted to ask the clerk about their return policy when she answered the phone and signaled to me to hold on a moment (while she takes care of the person on the line-- which turned out to be a stock check for a garment.) when the clerk came back from the stockroom i began asking her once more to explain the return policy when she answered the phone again! i was beside myself! how rude! please take care of customers who are in front of you first and foremost, phone calls can be put on hold, or ignored until you're free. second complaint is that there return policy is of the worst. i had the receipt for the item -- it was purchased at $28 plus tax but since it was bought over 21 days prior (purchased 30 days ago) i was only able to get a store credit for $11, which was the current sale price + tax. unbelievable horrible customer service at this establishment. not to mention all the jewelry and handbags i have purchased there have fallen part. no thank you francesca's you have lost a customer-- and i have 4 daughters, none of them will be patronizing your stores any longer, either."
5-star,1,"francesca's is a women's clothing shop that continues to grow on me. the nice thing about this store is it also serves as a gift shop. they offer a variety of fun mugs, plaques, t-shirts, and other novelty gifts, as well as clothing, fashion purses, and jewelry. today i was shopping for a gift and ended up finding 3 awesome tops for a great price (buy one get one 50% off), which seems to be their standard sale. they also have some great clearance racks. what occurred to me today is how pleasant the staff is. every time i have been inside their stores, the staff has been especially friendly and helpful! these stores are located in various states and malls. however, today i was shopping at the chandler fashion center and wanted to say thanks to the manager and assistant manager-thank you for making my shopping experience so pleasurable today! they even picked out some things for me to try based on my selections! thanks again-you two deserve a raise!!!"
1-star,0,i love francesca's but not this location. i was in there earlier today and i was treated so rudely by the staff. i bumped their overly stocked table and got ridiculed for knocking over some books. nothing broke and it was a total accident. but the staff there were so rude and treated me poorly.
5-star,1,"based off the previous reviews this store has really turned it around. the store is under new management it appears and everyone who has helped me has always been great, even getting on a ladder to get the picture i wanted. i would defiantly give this location another chance if you've had a bad experience."
2-star,0,"this store has gone downhill the past year :/ two ladies last night were sitting at the register chatting away as a friend and i walked in. it wasn't even slow, i would guess about 7 other people were in the store as well. things were not tidy the way they should be... i was looking for a pair of shoes that they had on display with no luck. the ladies were too busy chatting to ask if i needed help and i thought meh, i don't need another pair of overpriced wedges and left."
1-star,0,i love francescas style but had a horrible experience in the store today. i ordered a bunch of clothes online and all of it was way too big. when trying to return clothes at the store... they tried to con me into storw credit. stating the policy was 2 weeks to return. i had to go online and read the policy... horrible customer aervice. but i got my money back
2-star,0,"i love francesca's and there cute clothing but i am not a fan of the customer service at this location. i've been to many different francesca's, oregon, california, and here. and this is the 1st location i had a bad experience. i've been to this location many times, and have yet to encounter a nice welcoming person. when i was in last night, i was the only person in the store and was not even acknowledged once. the girls were to busy gossiping to be bothered with a customer. i found a dress that i really liked, but decided not to buy the dress because of how unfriendly the girls were. i can go to the location off ray road, buy my dress and have a much better experience."
5-star,1,"today my friends and i decided to go shopping today to treat ourselves and we landed in this cute store! we met the cutest short haired blonde girl who was do much fun, she was so personable unlike everyone in all of the other stores at the mall who say hi quietly and walk away! she was just the cutest girl ever and i will never forget that store because she made it memorable!"
5-star,1,"anytime i enter this shop i want to buy the whole lot up! it's the first place i go to for work outfits. they offer fun, youthful, and still classy options that you can't find at other places. the prices are pretty affordable. the shop itself is very relaxing and i feel very comfortable here."
4-star,1,i've been to the francesca's on ray before and loved it. now i'm thrilled there's one even closer to me located inside chandler fashion center. it's just as cute and funky and it was crowded with happy shoppers when i stopped in today. the staff was cheerful and personable as they helped out their customers from everything from sandals to belts to dresses. francesca's is reminiscent of anthropologie in scottsdale but with much friendlier price tags. will be stopping by this store every time i'm in the mall to keep finding adorable accessories and gifts. :d
5-star,1,"i love freshly baked tees! i've been coming here for several years to print shirts with memes i photoshop to include my brother's face. it's always a quick and easy process, and the service is great. $30-$40 for one shirt is on the steep side, but it's worth it for the quality of the tee and print plus the convenience of the on-the-spot job. lucas helped me out this week and he was awesome."
5-star,1,i purchased 2 tees. originally i wasn't satisfied with the results. joe the owner reached out to me and solve the issue to my satisfaction. i believe this level of attentiveness deserve a 5 star rating. keep up the good work! helpers don't be afraid to communicate your concerns with this business. they're open to it :)
4-star,1,"i had a less than impressive experience at the queen street store, and the owner heard about it, reached out, has been jumping through hoops to make it right. impressive and unexpected!"
5-star,1,best customer service ever! they were super understanding of when i needed my order and really helpful when it came to the design. i would definitely come back here!
4-star,1,i love this place except one white girl who has a bad attitude . every body there is very nice and respectful i will find out her name next time when i write a review
5-star,1,"i recently had the need to print some shirts for a trip and found the service provided by niall to be excellent. i had never printed shirts before and it was very simple, i walked in, emailed a picture i had made and they were able to tweak it to look great and print it right away. i was in and out in under 15 minutes. highly recommended."
5-star,1,conveniently close to parking on augusta. i simply emailed my design and they had it up quickly on a screen i could see easily. super knowledgeable staff and fast service. the showroom had a great selection of samples and i will be using them again for future events.
5-star,1,"needed a whole bunch of t shirts printed last minute and i could honestly not have been happier with the service. fast friendly and efficient! kyle who works there is amazing and professional, seriously epic experience at this place. highly recommend it!"
5-star,1,"in need of multiple shirts with varying graphics and sizes, i thought i had a complicated mess on my hands. however, kyle at the queen location made the experience a breeze. the process was painless and the shirts turned out really well! customer for life!"
5-star,1,just got two items printed here. service was really fast and friendly. naile took the time to make sure the images were exactly the way i wanted. very reasonably priced too!
5-star,1,got a tshirt made at the last minute for a christmas party by niall. he helped with the design and had it finished in 5 minutes. great quality tshirt as well.
5-star,1,"just had a special t-shirt made for my niece for the holidays. kyle and jordan helped me in flushing out my idea, and they made it even better! they worked great as a team to get the design and printing done. the final result is better than i had imagined. super happy!"
5-star,1,"went to buy a special custom tee for my cousin and was helped by niall - couldn't be happier with his customer service and the quality of the work! the black t-shirt they supply is a nice quality and the white printing looks great. fyi, you can bring your own t-shirt if you want. (i went up a size as it fits a bit small.) the service is very very quick too!i wasn't alone in my positive experience - the other customers around me were really pleased with both the quality and timing! thank you freshly baked tees!"
5-star,1,"very convenient tshirt printing! i uploaded my design online the day before and they printed it when i went in the next day. the printing took less than 5 minutes. the customer service was great! the person working was very welcoming. one tshirt cost 33 dollars, which i think is a fair price (on the lower average) for a custom shirt. the shirt looked great!!! i will definitely go back if i need a custom shirt again."
5-star,1,"awesome spot! quick, efficient, professional and helpful staff. always nice when people are able to think and offer and alternative, instead of deeming an issue unsolvable. keep up the good work!"
5-star,1,the place is stellar. i walked in a few weeks back with a very vague idea of what i wanted and grant(i'm pretty sure that's his name) was awesome. i needed a couple custom t's for a short film shoot and he well exceeded my expectations. he actually made the process fun and collaborative. much appreciated.
5-star,1,"i've been using these guys for many years for my staff uniforms and baseball team uniforms. always a quick turn around, excellent customer service and great pricing. i highly recommend them, thanks guys!"
5-star,1,"i don't usually get screen printed shirts. but after seeing them on yelp i had to check them out. it's actually really cool, you design online, then you come in to pick it up. can virtually make anything you want-- ummmmm yeaaaa! amazing."
5-star,1,"price was good, service was professional, quality is outstanding. these guys are connected to the guys at toronto t's. i could not be happier with both of their services, i use them regularly and would not hesitate to recommend them."
1-star,0,"the shirts they make look great but are poor quality...i had a shirt made and hand washed it separately, then put it in the dryer right away as the staff recommended, and i took out the dry shirt to find the ink had bled from the design onto the white shirt..it's not like the shirt was totally ruined but from a distance it looks like it has dirt on it because of the ink smears."
5-star,1,"ever wonder what to get someone as a personalized gift or to stand out at your next event? years ago i stumbled upon this 5 min custom t-shirt shop, needing a shirt made for an event launching pepsi's new flavor, throwback. i walked in to take them up on the offer, and was very impressed with the service. they photoshopped my chosen images from google using a wide, forward facing computer monitor while i watched, totally in the groove to the music playing in the shop. bang! in 5 minutes i had my pepsi shirt, changing the logo to say 'jive' and i was out the door and off to my event. yes, i did stand out at the event and even won a prize for it. freshly baked tees, sister to the home shop toronto tees, offers a great selection of high quality, super soft cotton tees to choose from and your print can be either vinyl (longer lasting) or heat transfer (cut and stick). can you print on anything other than tees? yes! they have hoodies, zipper hoodies, crewneck sweaters, longsleeves, tank tops, v-necks, baseball tees, track pants, hats and more to choose from at the shop. for one standard price of $29.75 you get the shirt and a print of your choice, with no need to fuss with a per letter or per inch pricing. so, get as creative as you like...tell them your idea for a t-shirt and there is nothing that they can't do...besides copyrighted photos and logos. even bring your own shirt and take $5 off the cost. look out for the pink painted building on queen street, and drop by this toronto gem when you can. see you tomorrow! what's next?"
4-star,1,"having checked around for a reasonably priced dry cleaners brought me to giant eagle. convenient, coupons, two days service, friendly. when i pay at pick up i always ask if the coupon was applied. i'm glad i asked the last time to save the $5."
2-star,0,"let's be honest, i'll still go here because it's close, but it is no longer my go to spot. it's expensive, except the weekly deals of course, the produce is terrible and it takes forever to check out. convenience is key here."
4-star,1,giant eagle is the place to get everything you need. the variety is wonderful. produce is fresh. my only complaint is the line. i can't ever seem to get out of there because they aren't well staffed. i always go to the automated registers to check out!
2-star,0,i'm a native pittsburgher but something is wrong with this location. can't use self check if you don't have your giant eagle card handy. always short staff checkouts so bad choice. clerks are rude and just doing their job as lamely as possible. questions or comments met with a heavy sigh. millions spent on disastrous ill-lit sections. s*** flows downhill so it's bad management. has to be on corporate radar because other locations much better. you can find me at heinens right up the street.
4-star,1,"had a issue with a birthday cake. they made it right by remaking the cake. also for having to wait, it was on the house"
4-star,1,"love giant eagle cakes...but i moved to an area where there are no giant eagles to be found. luckily, my grandparents live near this one. we ordered the almond cake for my mom's birthday with the intent that they would pick it up and bring it to toledo. i called 4 days before and placed my order. grandparents get there...only to be told they couldn't find the cake. they called the chagrin and solon stores to check that i hadn't called the wrong store, and then pulled a cake out of the freezer and got it ready for my grandparents. it wasn't until they were walking to check out did they find the cake...under the wrong name! but they were extremely accommodating to my grandparents and the cake was delicious. also, the remodel made the store awesome. i can't imagine it not having something you need."
1-star,0,"i stopped by yesterday evening, and found a couple small items. i went to go checkout, and when i showed her my 20% off coupon, the cashier wouldn't accept it because it was an oct one.. so its the 2nd of nov!.. usually those emails don't come through in time, and every other location, including this one will grant you the grace period. considering the entire business is in business bc of our local donations. after i stood there for what felt like 10 mins to reload my email on my phone, i was able to pull up the updated one, i showed her. the cashier then tells me how she'll be sure to tell corporate that other locations allow the 5 day window for the coupon use. talk about bad customer service..i understand if this was a coupon from a few months ago.. but they are the same coupons every month..diff barcode (so what) they don't scan it..they punch in a code. any who, she made it a point to be shitty, and decent customer service is hard to find.. this was a shining example."
1-star,0,"smelled like someone did something in there pants in this one. shooting up meth up front! i mean, i know it's goodwill and i was not expecting much, but i had some higher standards. go if you want to catch something!"
2-star,0,"definitely would suggest a different goodwill, because first of all the cashiers got attitude. although the clothes are trendy and priced quit reasonably some happen to be to pricy for the quality of the item. so i'm going to leave it at this goodwill needs a new staff asap and lower prices. also i'm not going to goodwill to get walmart prices i'm going to goodwill to snatch a spicy deal and some good quality hand me downs. plus the staffs attitude of i do say again is so crazy. one time i was pushed by a worker while looking for a water bottle, because apparently there wasn't enough room in the area for the worker to move without making a confrontation."
5-star,1,"this location is kept clean and organized, which makes things easy to find when in a hurry like i happened to be in today. one of the staff members seemed a little irked by the fact that i accidentally let the dressing room door close behind me on my way out, and seemed a bit confused when i asked him if i could leave few items of the clothes that i had decided not to buy with him because he was standing right next to the rack used for items going back out onto the floor. i didn't think much of that interaction because the clerk at the checkout counter was more than respectful. every item with a green tag on it happened to be on sale for a dollar so that was a pleasant surprise. i went inside to buy a pair jeans and i came outside with a bracelet, a jacket, a pair of jeans, a shirt and a poncho. goodwill always has been and always will be my favorite store in the universe!"
4-star,1,"this is the goodwill store that used to be around the corner in the same shopping mall but with the mcclintock address. i believe it moved about a year ago to this location which is a larger store. i've actually had pretty good luck at this goodwill recently. i've been here on previous trips and have come in 3 or 4 different times this trip. i always find some things that i can use or that i like. it's not the closest one to me but if i feel like driving that direction then i will stop by, especially on the 50 percent off saturdays. one bonus is it is next to a sprouts market, the arizona art supply store, and across the street from the coldstone ice cream. this last time i was in here i stopped into the outback restaurant for lunch, a place that i had never been to before. the store seems to be clean and organized, as much as it can be with all the people that go through messing it up. the prices are not too bad, though all the goodwills are not as reasonable as they used to be. but on the half price saturdays every other week you can really do well."
1-star,0,went to the store on s. eastern and serene on 6/17/2018 with lots of t shirts and collared shirts. help the people out. the lady at the desk hates her job and is a miserable person. did not make eye contact. did a little paper receipt for the items donated. do these people care about helping people or just being miserable. i am going to find another charity to help next time. shame no thank you or appreciate what you brought to the center. shame on this place.
1-star,0,this was by far the worst experience i've had ever they wouldn't take my money even though it was legit because they didn't accept older style hundreds even though it was real and their customer service was craps their selection with crap and they were rude and couldn't even explain to me why my money wasn't good any good there
2-star,0,"used to find clothes at a good price, and clothes were in good shape. last few times i shopped there, clothes were in very bad shape. many were ripped or dirty. i can understand wear from people trying them on, but what i saw were holes in clothes, and filth, like stains or dried on food. you would think that since they get everything for free, they would pay someone to look over clothes before they put on racks. seems like they put everything they take in on the racks without checking them out."
2-star,0,"now....i must say, there are times where i find some great stuff here. but, ever since the bankruptcy filing of goodwill.....it's like....what happened???? first, how does a business who runs on donations, and not have to pay for any inventory....have to file bankruptcy? sounds like mismanagement, and some overspending of funds finally caught up to them here. because only nv goodwill has filed bk. now prices. since filing, they have been so gracious as to overprice about 99% of their items. there is no longer any way of telling if something is on sale or not, and staff look like they are in forced labor.....sad faces, no one speaks, sometimes i walk by and pass gas just to see if i can get them to react.... :) lastly, attempts to alter prices on priced merchandise. my last visit to goodwill about 3 weeks ago this occurred. upon check out, the clerk attempted to increase prices at the register!!! can you say illegal!!!!!!! luckily, a manager was smart enough to understand me when i told her how illegal that was....interesting because this is also a slick way for people to steal by removing extra money out registers. i don't know the future of goodwill here in nv, but they can start by firing everybody, and bringing in some people with honor, and integrity."
1-star,0,"rude and very unorganized... i wanted to use the fitting room so i went in and the door i tried was locked, nobody in it. so i went to find an associate and the one i found told me that they are unlocked and if they were locked someone was obviously in it. then proceeded to giggle to another associate about it. so i went back, luckily someone was walking out so i got a room. i also had a very hard time figuring out where one size started and the other ended. there were maybe 3 size rings that i saw. clothes all over the floor and just overall the reason goodwill gets a bad name. hate to leave a bad review being that i absolutely love going to goodwill stores.."
1-star,0,over price everything !! used bras almost ten dollars !! extremely over price big disappointment because for those prices you can already pay for unworn clothing
2-star,0,i'm not a thrift shopper but my friend is. i went with her just to glance around. they really need to dust this store my allergies were going crazy from all the mothballs! goodwill is not dirt cheap like it used to be. a lot of the items are overpriced. why pay 7.99 for a uses shirt when you can get a brand new shirt for the same price? i refuse to pay for overpriced used clothes. i only bought some dvds here. the rest of the items are not my style! oh yeah they also had a used dresser for 400 bucks lol. goodwill is suppose to help the community not see what they can get from poor people.
4-star,1,i am a vip goodwill shopper. the customer service was good. merri (cashier) and antonio (manager) was very helpful. the store layout was different than i am accustom to being a goodwill shopper. they had fairly decent inventory available for women. i found duplicates of some items which was very helpful. they were all new with tags. the mens inventory was not so great. they were restocking the store during my visit. a few racks were empty.
1-star,0,very very over priced. so many things cost more than i could purchase the item new. who determines the prices in these stores. no chance of me ever shopping there again.
2-star,0,"i've made a few visits to this location this month for some halloween odds and ends for costumes. i just have to say my visit yesterday was the worst. not only was the store pretty messy, but the line to check out was absurd. four people on the floor were stocking shelves and three were behind the register with only one ringing guests out. in my 15 minutes waiting in line, i heard the manager being called 4 times and no one ever came. another manager or shift leader finally came asked one question to the person actually working, then walked outside and never came back in. i was appalled, i am a manager myself and if there is ever a line of customers that extends halfway through your store, take note and jump on a register. i will never go back to this location due to the managements inability to perform at a manager level."
1-star,0,"i have donated a lot of items to goodwill over the years..i believe in helping people wherever that might be. there have been some really nice people that work for the company, that being said there are some that need to find another place to be. i dropped off a stroller to the goodwill truck on eastern and horizon ridge location the other day. i turned my back to get in my car and by the time i turned back around i saw the young man throw the stroller underneath the truck..i am not saying he sat it gently he threw it- probably broke it. i told him i did not appreciate it him doing that. he just looked at me like i was stupid. i will probably find other places to donate to in the future. if he hates his job that much he needs to find something different to do."
3-star,0,"thrift shopping is always a hit or miss. the past two times i've been here i found really good clothes. i don't care for name brand things as long as it looks nice but i have scored name brands like banana republic and loft. rather pay less than $10 for a cute sweater or shirt than something $50+ haha. today i went in twice today and both times the cashiers were slow. do you not see people standing right in front of you? the second time i was waiting to be rung up, an employee greeted me-in hopes that he would ask if i was ready but he didn't. apparently the computers were down but at least inform me. i'm pretty sure the cashier who ended up ringing me up saw me standing there too."
1-star,0,"i use to frequent this place 2-3 times a week for over a 2 year span. i would spend hundreds of dollars every month on just random items that i couldn't leave behind. i absolutely used to love this place but then it all changed. the change came with the new management a few months ago. whomever is running this place now should not be in the position they are in, they are absolutely clueless. the pricing is absolutely ridiculous, to the point where you can find the same item next door at 99 cent store for 1/3 of the price. due to the extreme price hikes, traffic has died down and it's evident when you walk in and it looks like a junk yard. nobody is buying and the junk just keeps piling. to make matters worse, theft appears to be rampant especially among the small boxed items. an item that use to cost a couple bucks is now 10 to 15 dollars and people are simply pocketing them (lots of empty boxes). some items are priced so high that they sit on the shelf for months and day after day, the content is slowly looted. do not waste your time here. go to the stephanie location which is about a 10 minute drive from here. it's more organized and the prices are normal. dear corporate - do yourselves a favor and replace the dimwits you call managers that are running this place into the ground."
1-star,0,"very disappointed! just donated several $100's of items a few weeks ago following my move to the area. over 40 large boxes of items. called today to schedule another pick up only to be told unless i have large furniture items they can not do a home pick up. i told them i have 20+ moving boxes full of household items and picking up boxes wasn't a problem when they came a few weeks ago to pick up about 40 boxes. when i told them they did a pick up then, the girl answering the call just hung up on me! they will never get another item from me! i called salvation army and had no problem scheduling a pick up. that's where all my donations will be going from now on!"
2-star,0,"i've been thrifting quite a bit lately for my diy wedding decor and anytime we're in a area and see a thrift shop, i have to stop in. while this location had a lot of stuff. it also felt claustrophobic as the aisles are too narrow have more than 1 person in it and things are just everywhere. that's fine so long as there are deals, but i was just plain discouraged at the prices they wanted to pull for some stuff. i looked at vases and one of the simple single flower vases was $3.99. i bought the exact same ones at another thrift shop for 49 cents. what is even more ridiculous is these vases were originally from the dollar tree. i saw a few other vases that looked similar to what i have which were also $2-3 where the ones i bought were 99cents. i was looking for large vintage floral serving plates for the dessert table display. most of these were $4-5 a piece. i just bought a few at another store for $1-2. i still browsed a few more knick knacks and after i found all were priced too high, i just stopped and left. it's other peoples junk that they got for free to sell."
4-star,1,"a little pricier than other goodwils i have been to, but it's definitely a lot more organized than most. not to mention it doesn't smell bad like a lot of thrift store do, it smells like apple airfresheners!"
3-star,0,"as far as goodwill locations go, this store is pretty good. if you are looking for clothing, particularly denim jeans and t-shirts, this is one of the most well-stocked in vegas. it's not great on the housewares, dresses or furniture so if you are looking for those things i would recommend one of the other goodwill stores in town. the aisles are super tiny so don't get a cart unless absolutely necessary. the clothing racks are overstuffed with merchandise, making it difficult to browse or move the clothes hangers. this store in particular is very, very popular with the elderly: they'll be clogging the aisles shopping next to you and they like to donate all of their free casino crap t-shirts, drinking glasses and other random station casinos logo'ed ""trinkets of treasure"" here (guess it's better than giving them as x-mas gifts to the grandkids)! check the sign when you come in because this location offers lots of sales and specials. the quality of stuff is what you'd expect at goodwill (if you want items in nicer condition, check out savers instead) and the prices are low. i've scored awesome vintage t-shirts in decent condition for 50 cents. can't beat that, fellow hipsters!"
1-star,0,"the last time i came here on one of the days where they have those specials for different color tags i was super excited because i love thrift shopping & you would expect the prices to be super low after the discount they offered. i searched practically every single rack and could not find a single thing with the color tag i was looking for. its like they purposely hid them from the customers or something. also the staff here are not the friendliest, i did not see one smile, and when one of the staff (i believed she might of been a manager) tried to squeeze by me i apologized for my cart in the way and she just rolled her eyes and said i need to get through. the aisles are super small and can barely fit 2 people in them. the only thing i found that i liked was a pair of moccasins in pretty good shape & there was two stickers on them, one cheaper then the other. when i went to checkout the woman at the register took the cheaper sticker off and charged me 7 dollars for a pair of shit shoes. im sorry but i just don't recommend this place, not good selection for cute women's clothing & pretty pricey for a ""thrift store"" and the staff isn't very nice. you might as well drive to a different thrift store instead of wasting your time here."
2-star,0,"this thrift store is pretty small, and very unorganized. i went to go find some inexpensive summer clothes for my little one and they don't organize the clothes by size or gender, so i was frustrated and ended up not buying anything. lots of old used stuff priced higher than the $.99 store rights next door, too."
2-star,0,"i'm not a fan of this particular goodwill. it's on the smaller side and their selection wasn't the best or kept particularly organized or clean. the parking lot for this location is busy and it's often hard to find parking since there are so many different shops and restaurants in one small area. i also dislike the checkout line process, since there is no discernable order to checking out and the line can get a bit out of hand since no one can tell where the line starts and who is in front of whom."
2-star,0,"every time i've been here, it's been busy, which is unfortunate given how narrow the aisles are. if somebody is in one of the rows of clothes with a cart, you have to awkwardly squeeze past and hope you don't knock clothes off. there's little chance of passing someone if you both have carts. the store in general always seems crowded, slightly disorganized, and a little dingy. i don't think it's actually dirty; it just seems that way since the rows are so narrow and there's so many people and it feels a bit claustrophobic."
4-star,1,"this is by far one of the better & bigger gw's in the valley. their prices are more in line with savers or epic. -not crazy or sizist (smells are more expensive than larges, or vice-versa) like a few of the other goodwill locations. they are pretty organized & their staff is friendly. i try to make a stop here whenever i'm even remotely near the area."
5-star,1,"a friend recently sent me a great quote ""taking back your ex is like buying your shit back from your own garage sale."" while i find this to be true, it doesn't have a lot to do with any of the las vegas goodwill stores. luckily, i love the goodwill stores in las vegas because they have so much weird crap! go whenever you can and look for the strange & unusual if you're into that. i once found an amazing 2 headed goat. the amount of creepy looking house-hold items at las vegas goodwill stores is far above the national average."
4-star,1,"after shopping at the 99 cent store in the same shopping center, we decided to stop in here to look around and see if we could find anything worthwhile. i was surprised when the better half called me over to the display case at the front of the store to show me a large marble carving....it was awesome and matched a set of lamps in our living room! normally, we don't find items like this in a thrift store, but it was our lucky day i guess. the price for it? $10! we gladly paid for it and of course, i had to carry this thing out to the car. it was 30 lbs or so, but it was worth the effort. i'm glad we stopped by the 99 cent store that day otherwise we wouldn't have found this gem. return factor - 90%"
4-star,1,"i love to go thrift shopping from time to time but, my favorite thrift store (savers) is too far away so, this (for the most part) is my only choice in the area. especially since i go ""thrifting"" when i get my car washed next door. goodwill is great for finding jeans for me to distress, cut-up, and dye. i tend to find good levi's and kids jeans that fit me quite well. recently went in looking for halloween costumes. almost found a captain america fit but, it was a bit too small. left with a cool denim and bubble vest. almost left with an amazing orange and gold jacket but, it was too big for me. in general, ""thirfting"" has it's great vintage and unique finds. prices are good and they even have special days/discounts. i got a discount on my pieces because i had a player's card."
3-star,0,they have alot of clothes. they recently expanded the back to allow for more furniture. they have a decent selection of items but i think that their prices are sometimes way too high for a thrift store.
1-star,0,"i've had a long standing love/hate relationship with goodwill - love it since i'm a hoarder, but its a for profit ""non profit"" that has a lot of balls to charge what they do for inventory they received free. they sell a lot of things from target and actually charge more than retail price, which is ridiculous. but it is what it is, and this review isn't specifically about the eastern location, but wherever goodwill of southern nv office is. i was moving so had a ridiculous pile of things for donation - way too much to drop off w out a truck. submitted their ""preferred"" online form for a home pick up on a wednesday. didn't hear anything for a week, called the number listed for donations and it was ridiculous. the person said she didnt even have my form. said they did pick ups for my zipcode only on sundays. they will give you a few hours timeframe and you have to be home or they wont take anything. i can only assume because some idiot has taken things in the past that weren't out for donation. they gave me the names of some other charities that supposedly do pick ups (couple of which i know for sure don't). i went with salvation army and they were awesome - quick, prompt and you can just leave it out for them."
3-star,0,"it's a bigger goodwill store than the one on rainbow, but a little smaller than the one near tropicana. always has something interesting to buy -- be it weird star wars helmets, nintendo 64 systems, or a giant popcorn maker in the shape of a penguin. always an amusing way to spend a lunch hour."
5-star,1,"this place is awesome. gordy's has been there for my husband when he raced as a boy and is still up and running now that our son is racing. gordy's does a fantastic job with the service and prices. it is a one of a kind place for bmx racers and supporters alike. i know some people like to complain about pricing, but they are the only shop in town, they know what you need if you need anything, and they will service it for you in house. go support your local bmx shop and go to gordy's!"
5-star,1,"very helpful, originally came in to buy a 26"" bike. they helped me make a better decision, recommended other bike options and sizes like 24"" and 22"". i ended up buying a fitbikeco bf22 and i'm very happy with the recommendation from what i originally wanted. everyone was very helpful and knowledgable. ask for gary he helped me all the way through making a better pick. thanks"
5-star,1,this is an old school bike shop. the people are friendly and take time to get to know you. they aren't just after a sell. quality people and items.
5-star,1,"brice met me as i entered the store asking how he may help me, a personable young man. i inquired regarding the price to replace front & rear brake pads on my mountain bike, and if i needed an appointment to do so. he quoted the price and said it could be done right then. the mechanic replaced the pads in a reasonable amount of time, and i was on the road again. the store appears to be equipped with a nice selection of bicycle accessories, tires, rims, and team clothing. i shall do repeat business with this shop. thank you, gordy's."
5-star,1,"just left gordy's bicycles with a new 16"" starter bike for my youngest boy and a sweet new redline bike for me. couldn't be happier with the service and selection they had and i am very glad i drove well out of my way to see these guys."
1-star,0,"it was suggested by a very knowledgeable friend to come here even though it was well out of my way, both he and his brother had been coming here for years. apparently the change in family management has turned this shop into a shop of indifference and suspect repairs...i had shopped around and noticed their service was more expensive when compared to others rt down the street and in the nw basin. i picked my bike up with zero smiles, zero thanks, and zero feedback on what to keep an eye on or what will need replacing etc in the future. that should have been the 2nd tipoff, price being the first. once back in the saddle i felt like all i received was an wayyy overpriced bike wash. i have exactly the same gear change issues as before, along with other minor issues that should have been taken care of at that price. blows my mind that with an opportunity to start a business relationship and create future sales opps this establishment completely dropped the ball. after reading some of the similar stories here i decided to not call and complain because obviously they dont care, i will just take my money elsewhere...goodbye, good luck n good riddance..."
5-star,1,good old-fashioned elbow grease and customer service fix the problem another bike shop could not fix for literally $.54 awesome solution awesome price awesome service would definitely recommend this repair shop to a friend.
1-star,0,horrible horrible service and treated like a fool by punks at store. i purchased a new dirt bike for my son for christmas. he doesn't go offroad but we have already spend more on tires and tunes than the bike cost. after my sons tire went bad i asked for new heavy duty tires and tubes. the service guy said he would be ready in two hours and when i came 5 hours later it was not done. the kid told me he was busy. thanks for the call man. then he proceeded to do a service in front of me for a guy who just walked in and made me wait. my sons new tire went flat as soon as i got home. had to go back and was treated like a fool. they fixed it. it went flat the next day. my wife went in and they made her by a new tube. are you kidding me. you botch the job and then say we don't know how to keep pressure in the tire. your shop did it. guy i manage a big boy automotive tire business i know how tires work. i will never shop with these lazy crooked punks again.
5-star,1,"i'm a loyal customer! my kids and i showed up right when they were closing but they saw i had a flat and let us in, fixed us up and sent us on our way! super nice family owned bike shop... i will never go anywhere else!"
5-star,1,"great bike shop! i was looking for a specific tire made by freedom thickslicks. i asked if they carried the tire,they didn't carry in their normal assortment. the sales associate offered to order them for me and price match online too. great service from a brick and mortar!"
5-star,1,"i went into gordy's just to pick up an inner tube. the gentleman went out of his way to make sure the bike we brought in was the correct size for my son. he offered to changed out the inner tubes for $7.00 labor, which was a smoking deal. after i paid he then offered to adjust my sons seat. wonderful service. we were just on our way back to gordy's to look at helmets today."
5-star,1,i am so thankful to rj. he made it possible for me to buy the bike i have been wanting for so long (3yrs to be exact). i am so happy with my new trike. dealing with balance issues this was really my only option if i wanted a bike but i couldn't afford it. thank you so much guys for everything. it was a pleasure doing business with you.
5-star,1,my son found an aaron ross bike online that he was obsessed with. called gordys to see if they could track one down. turns out that specific model was not even out yet. i left my number and was thrilled they called to tell me they had found one and were holding it for me. best birthday present ever!i have also purchased a top of the line scooter and have had the bike serviced there several times. everything has been done in a timely manner and the people that work there are super nice.
1-star,0,"i have now had 3 bad experiences at gordy's so i think i will go ahead and assign the sad ""one star"". 1st experience: my husband drops off a bike for repairs and pays up front. i pick up the bike a week later and get charged the same amount - as they claimed he had not paid for it. sure enough i found i'd been charged twice for the same work. i told them this when i went back in for bad experience number 2 and they had no interest in fixing the previous mix up. 2nd experience: i brought in a bike for repairs and also wanted to purchase a brand new bike. they make a ticket for the little bike i brought in and don't ever take it back. it took forever for the person to process the new bike for me - mostly because he kept talking to people. he kept disappearing and seemed kind of lost as well. at the end, i've purchased a new bike and they say they will come and help me load it into the truck. it's a large men's mountain bike and had my bag and small child with me. the sales guy actually starts talking to a customer as he is walking back to get the bike for me and never comes back! i'm not sure if he had a massive attention deficit issue or what but then he (and an employee that is just standing around doing nothing) see me trying to keep ahold of my kiddo, my purse, and steer a bike that is way to big for me (because it was a gift) out of the store. and no one offered to help at all. i felt that was a big slap in the face when i've just purchased the bike, talk about buyer's remorse. also, just to drop off the bike for repairs and to purchase a new bike (which i knew which one i wanted when i walked in the door and didn't need anytime to think it over) took almost two hours! had i not been so desperate to get out of that place, i would have asked them to just return it because they were so incredibly rude immediately after i gave them the money for the new bike. 3rd (and final) experience: my husband goes to pick up the bike that was repaired (at least it was suppose to be repaired). they can't find it. he is there for almost an hour and after they find it, low and behold, nothing had been done to the bike. i think that they probably do good work on bikes (if they get around to doing it), as in, they are probably good at the ""hands on"" part of the work and if you don't mind waiting for lengthy periods of time and if they don't lose your bike.... then you may find them to be a good fit. but they are horribly unorganized and have serious customer service issues. -- to clarify, they have never been rude, just painful unorganized and they have no sense of urgency or appropriate professional courtesy."
1-star,0,"bad customer service. the techs there are more concerned with chatting with friends than helping a customer. waited 15 minutes for help, then said excuse me. was told to wait by clerk passing on phone. chose to leave, plenty of alternatives."
5-star,1,awesome set of guys. they do great work and they take care of all your freestyle scooter needs. which i have found it hard to find in the valley. they come highly recommended.
5-star,1,"new to this shop, after a 10 yr layoff of bikes myself, i walked in for some parts for my son to get into bmx racing. they treated me like i was an old friend. sold me what i wanted, made repairs and explained the process to me like they wanted to and they seem to enjoy all of it. same thing every time i come back! so i keep coming back :)"
5-star,1,"my son is 6 years old and had a flat tire on his bike so we brought it up to the shop. my son was so proud of learning how to ride his bike, so he wanted to walk his bike in to the shop by himself like a big kid. like many other shops such as skate shops or other trendy shops i was apprehensive about this feeling like the guys at the shop might just be way to ""cool"" to give him the time of day. i was very wrong in this case. the guys behind the counter talked to him and treated him with the utmost respect, encouraged him and left him excited and feeling like he was part of something. our family really appreciated this and will be return customers. thank u guys so much, we will be return customers for years to come. respect!!"
4-star,1,"personalized service - called2ask a ?,went in2store,guy remembered me from phone,called back2ask another?,guy remembered me&knew exactly what i was talking about. can't complain about price either(less than$5 total proves no price gouging!) the only reason i held back 1star is there was room 4 improvement,efficiency-wise. when we walked in everybody-and i mean everybody:@least3employees&4-8 customers coming&going-was in the back of the store,in the svc area. nobody up front minding the register and/or providing initial information/customer svc. having a person@the register would've allowed me2ask4my part&get in&out of there in a jiffy,rather than wait for 15-20 minutes. no question: overall positive experience! i will return&support what appears 2 be a locally owned business!"
2-star,0,"as it was recommended for me to go there to find parts for an older bike that i was fixing up, i stopped in and spoke with the a guy who did take the time to talk with me about the parts i was needing. we looked through a catalog (very over priced and not exactly what i wanted) when he then told me he would begin his search for these parts immediately. he handed me a card (which was for another person from the shop, since he did not have his own) and said he would call me the coming week. after i did not hear back, i made 2 phone calls asking about my search. each time, the guy took a message and never called me back. i gave up on them and ordered exactly what i wanted online without the middle man. plus the prices online were about half the price and on sale. not sure why it was recommended."
4-star,1,"so i came into h&m looking for a birthday outfit, therefore i tried on several items. as i entered the dressing room a very goofy associate, i believe her name was genesis, right away helped me and offered to get any additional sizes for me. as i was being indecisive, she helped me choose which outfit to buy, helping me make something like a pros and cons list, if you will. anyway, i was standing in line very happy because i love good service, but as i reach the register the most grouchy lady i have every encountered helped me check out. her name was sara, she definitely made me look at h&m and their associates differently, but thank you genesis!"
1-star,0,i'm leery about shopping here. i would hope that corporate takes interest in customer service and the attitude of its employee's. has anyone contacted corporate? nothing will change if you don't speak up.
1-star,0,"worst experience, customer service is awful! a sweater had the wrong price listed on the price tag and instead of honoring the price, they insisted for me to pay full price. terrible terrible service-"
1-star,0,"sara is a rude af & has a nasty ass attitude . worst service. h&m should not be letting people like her be around customers. find better workers please, some who actually enjoy their job and are willing to treat people nicely."
1-star,0,"i came in just to look at a few quick items. i wasn't actually intending to even purchase anything. the girl quickly approached me informed me that the store was closed. it was six minutes till closing time. i informed her that it was still six minutes until closing time. she said, ""oh, i rounded up."" very rude. didn't even ask if she could help me. so unprofessional."
5-star,1,it's a cool store. i love fashion and finding good treasures. the store is one of the most organized and clean from most h&m i've been too. everyone is very nice! also they are open at 9 during the weekdays now.
1-star,0,"the sales associates were very rude when my mom returned an item to their store, claiming it had been worn and washed. the tags were still on the sweater, so i have no idea why they thought it was washed. i tried it on once at home and that was it. poor customer service leaves me very disappointed with this establishment."
2-star,0,"it's funny, i don't shop here often. maybe once or twice a year. i have shopped off rue st. catherine in montreal, and other locations in canada infrequently, and always had pleasant service. google reviews wouldn't show my below comments so i am posting them here. because of that i just gave them a one there. here i will give them a two because of the excellent service from the accessories manager. so i have recently found myself in a new job position and needed clothing for work. i went to a variety of stores looking for business attire since it has been a while since i have needed it. on may 2nd, i went into the store to look at the selection of mens shirts. it didn't take long before i was approached by a sales man in glasses and asked, ""is there something i can help you find?"" he looked about my age, was good looking, and seemed like he would be helpful. he asked me what i was looking for. so i informed him that i was looking for mens dress shirts in a solid color. he then replied, ""if i can be forward with you, it might be hard for you to find that since that is not in style right now."" he then scowled and kept talking. i thought to myself, ""oh, so what you're telling me is that the one thing i am shopping for is out of style. so in other words i am out of style."" i let him ramble on for a few minutes before i flat out told him that i disagreed. i happen to own a tom ford dress shirt in solid black, it might be a few years old, but it is not out of style. and for the record, i am more then sure that tom ford's and many other designers 2017 releases had solid colors amongst all the mini sailboat and farm animal patterns you can buy at simons. nothing against farm animals. i told him that solid patterns were part of the dress code at my new employer and needed to ensure that patterns on my shirts were kept to a minimum. so i informed him that i disagreed with him. i flat out told him that i find him pretentious and would like someone else to help me. luckily, the jeanette the accessories manager overheard me and came to my rescue. she was helpful and professional. she was friendly and courteous and everything you expect someone to be. she helped me purchase a boss slimfit dress shirt with very minimal ""windowpane?"" check stitching for $262. she saved the day. and i would rate this store a 5 based on my experience with her, but i think that a point needs to be made. when you are shopping for luxury goods, or even just regular goods, you need to be treated with a friendly attitude. it doesn't have to be over the top or fake, just civil. i didn't ask for advice. when you are only being paid twenty something dollars an hour, it doesn't give you the right to be snobby. if you want to be a pretentious artist, go to design school and join the crowd. when you actually design something and create your own brand, then you can come at me with your attitude if that's what you still want to do."
1-star,0,my boyfriend bought a 1000.00 suit from harry rosen chinook and they told him there was a lifetime warranty on repairs. great! 2 years later he brought the pants back for repairs and one of the young sales guys said they couldn't fix those pants. really? after all the hype of harry rosen and their lifetime warranty...so my boyfriend took the pants to his dry cleaners and guess what?? they fixed the expensive pants for 40.00! and did an awesome job! harry rosen couldn't even be bothered to help a client. is their service as good as their clothing? hmmm. won't be going there ever again.
1-star,0,"my son and i walked into this store and looked around looking for a shirt for him. 3 sales people standing around and not one came to even say a simple ""hi"" or a smile. what a bunch of snooty sales people. especially the gray haired woman who looked at me, my clothes, purse. then looked away. no customer service whatsoever. have they not been coached that it's the first most important thing when you're in retail? needless to say, we walked out and went into the store next door where we were welcomed warmly and spent time to actually find a shirt. good thing i didn't secret shop at harry rosen because this review would be even worse. i will not be stepping into that store anytime soon."
1-star,0,"yup, this place sucks for service. i was there with a friend of mine. they asked if we needed help, but after that it was all downhill. my buddy was looking for a new shirt and tie and some slacks for a job interview. i was just browsing. when my buddy was indecisive on what to get the guy started taking shots at him like ""it's not rocket science just pick one"", you need to spend more money for the quality we have"", ""are you an accountant"",etc. unbelievable. after the first insult i stopped browsing and the guy helping my firends continued insult him 4 or 5 times. i have had great service at the td location, but i was so put off i question why i would ever buy from any of their locations again. the worst display of customer service i have ever personally witnessed!"
1-star,0,"oh how the mighty have fallen. you know what i will never come back to this location after last night never. i may shop at the down town store because i received excellent customer service there but here i was nothing but snubbed. listen really closely employees of harry rosen heed my advice. it is the christmas season you should be jumping at the opportunity to help customers not ignoring them i was looking for a wallet to purchase. after i was so fed up with your customer service and i really mean lack of i left walked across the way into burberry and they were more than happy to not only help me but i made a purchase that could have been yours! so lesson learned just because i'm dressed in jeans and sweater doesn't mean i don't have the monetary funds to spend in your store. the store wasn't busy employees were a plenty some folding some walking around not one and mean this not one stopped to asked if i needed help (which i did) or properly acknowledged me. horrible horrible horrible. say it with me now ""the customer is number 1"" the money we spend in your store influences your hours thus effecting your pay! so cut this pompous act i worked in retail for 4 years i would have been fired if i purposely ignored someone. so unimpressed! the end result doesn't really matter because i got was i was looking for else where no thanks to these guys."
5-star,1,exquisite boutique in north scottsdale. heidi's clothing and accessories are always top of the line with the best trends and always in style for a high-end fashion forward look. the selection and fabric is amazing and all the style choices are spot on. the staff is kind and friendly and the best part is that all her fashions are on instagram and facebook and they can ship your selections to you anywhere. if you travel and need something on the go -- this is the place to find the perfect outfit for your vacay or for date night!! i enjoy and prefer to shop local and shop small business and this is the place just for that! you will not be disappointed.
5-star,1,best store in scottsdale. workers are very sweet and helpful. they have amazing taste in clothing for merchandise and carry plenty of sizes for clients. the review that had said that they only carry clothes for a size 4 or smaller is not true. the clothing she carries has sizes for every body type. highly recommend.
5-star,1,"i love this clothing boutique!! the store is small and super cute. when i went in i was greeted with friendly faces so it made my shopping experience comfortable. i'm a fast shopper so they were helpful mainly because they can see my size and style. the selections are very trendy, and they mentioned their fall stuff will be coming in so i will def be back to shop."
1-star,0,no need to come here unless you are a size 4 or smaller. and the selection is pitiful. you can view every item in the shop in less than 5 minutes. and not very friendly. i've been in the shop about 3 times and there has never been anyone else in there. i don't understand how they continue to stay in business.
5-star,1,"my absolute favorite boutique in the valley. so many boutiques have come and gone over the 11 years i've lived here and heidi's boutique remains a constant. awesome brands, and truly phenomenal customer service. definitely recommend. anytime i need a dress for any event this is my go to. huge selection of jeans and jewelry as well. love love love!!!"
2-star,0,"very cute patterns and clothes. however, they only had extra small's and small's. the girl working also couldn't lift her head up from her phone to greet us when we walked in."

5-star,1,"took my 3 nieces who were visiting from the east coast for their spring break to get henna tattoos. they were very pleased with their hennas, and also loved the clothes, jewels and cool items the store had to offer. the staff were super attentive, prices were very fair and the girls ended up buying skirts, jewlery and gifts to bring back for their friends. we made an appointment ahead of time, which i'm glad we did because it's a busy little place. will definitely shop here again!"
5-star,1,"passed by the shop last night and came back today for the best henna tattoo i ever received. i wanted a dragon and we did a bit research and it came out amazing. beth is a master and at her art. she's also super chill, kind and gives you a peace vibe that makes you want to visit with her everyday. she also took time to explain how to care for the tattoo."
5-star,1,i really recommend going to the henna shoppe to get your henna done. this is my first time getting one and i loved it! i brought in my own design and beth did an excellent job! she is awesome! i had a welcoming experience here and the atmosphere is relaxing.
5-star,1,"wow! stopped in while walking around old town scottsdale & so glad i did! lydia was amazing with her threading skills & even went above & beyond to help me find a cute top to wear since what i packed for this trip wasn't quite cool enough. if you like an earthy feel & want to get in touch with your inner flower child while experiencing great customer service, this is the place for you!"
5-star,1,really cool shop with relaxing vibes. pru was awesome for my first henna tattoo! i decided to have her do a freestyle design and it turned out amazing. can't wait to come back for another one!
5-star,1,"our first henna experience was awesome! beth was super friendly and explained everything well. there were 6 of us and they accommodated us with no problems. 3 of us even let beth do freehand and the designs were beautiful! i am from the east coast, but i will return the next time i'm in town. the shop also had some beautiful clothing and jewelry priced very reasonable! you must go!"

5-star,1,"was so happy with my experience here. me and my boyfriend were just browsing around when we walked in here. i have done henna many times before but i will admit this is one of my best experiences. i mentioned i wanted an original price and explained only a couple of things o was interested in. beth immediately had an idea in mind and said she would do it no problem. she was very understanding, nice, professional, and had an all around good vibe( which i enjoyed). she created an absolutely amazing one of a kind piece on me which i very much love and enjoy in an amazing 15 minute period. i will be coming back to this location again when i am in town next. if you are looking for good henna and good company, this is the place to go. ask for beth i included a picture of the initial henna, and then one from the next morning. so beautiful."
5-star,1,beth was absolutely amazing and really friendly when my girls wanted matching henna's. she took the picture and was able to duplicate it perfectly on each of the girls. she is a great artist and was helpful and provided them with all of the follow up care and tips to make their henna last. we will definitely be back the next time we are in town.
5-star,1,"my bff and i made a mad dash through scottsdale before heading to the phoenix airport. big thanks to sally for hooking us up with two custom henna tattoos at the last minute. great artist, cool tunes, and a fun souvenir."
5-star,1,love my henna tattoo!! my daughter and i had such a great experience!! what a cute store too! will def recommend coming here again!
5-star,1,my friends and i decided to make a pit stop to see how this whole henna thing works and we caught jess in the middle of finishing up a great piece of artwork on this teenagers arm and i was all for it! i am so happy i did because jess did such an amazing job! it looks amazing and i got a lot of compliments after i had left the shop! thank you jess again! i definitely enjoyed the time with you and the piece of artwork you did for me
5-star,1,"this place is amazing!! we weren't sure of what to think when we first walked in, but we were welcomed right away. the women were so nice, especially zulma. she was so talented. highly recommend."
5-star,1,the ladies in the shop helped my fiancée pick out some great dresses. i suggested that she get some henna done while she was there also so she could see if it would be a tattoo she would actually want. they turned out beautiful! jess was patient and did a wonderful job. great shop all around.
5-star,1,the second you walk in you're greeted by smiles and a greeting. super nice staff!! was extremely in love with my henna. i honestly wanted to buy the entire store. the entire store is filled with the cutest clothes and jewelry.
5-star,1,"walked in at first to do a skin test and beth was really explanatory about any allergic reactions that could happen and gave me a tiny peace sign to see if i was allergic. i came back in about two hours very happy that i was feeling fine and asked to get a koi fish done. beth said i could pull out a picture on google and she got it done in like an hour because we were talking through it, she is so friendly and a delight! i will definitely come again and bring girlfriends too."
5-star,1,"i love this place! i came in with my nieces and had a super fun time! savannah gave us a beautiful design at a very reasonable price. she is extremely talented, creative and a real artist! quick, surprisingly fun and inexpensive..i highly recommend her!"

5-star,1,i love this store me and my husband walked around the mall and i went in yesterday after i seen a gal have it on her hand! it was awesome! so jessica did the design on my shoulder and i fell in love with the idea! no pain and it goes away after a week! perfect for me! i came back in today and had beth do the design on my hand. and again it is amazing! after they finished with my henna tattoo they put a little bit of glitter dust on it! love that little touch. both of the gals did a fantastic job! after i had my fix of henna tattoos for the day we had thelma thread our eye brows! totally different then waxing ! she did a great job :)

5-star,1,"came in today with granddaughter who got the most beautiful henna tattoo from beth. we were both delighted with it. take a look at the photo. i got a smaller one that didn't hold up well because i got it on the lower arm and it is too active of an area (i think). nice, clean attractive shop with lots of interesting goodies to buy. will come by with friends soon. thanks beth."
5-star,1,my 17 year old daughter and i wanted to get henna tattoos. we spent such a great afternoon with beth and didn't want to leave. she's remarkably sweet and talented. we really had a great time. my daughter had a picture of ganesh which beth was able to recreate and it looked phenomenal! i loooove my palm henna tattoo. we will be back again.
5-star,1,"we stopped in to get henna tattoos while we were walking around old scottsdale. my friend and i had actually gotten henna the day before at a different place for the first time and our other friend wanted to get one done. this place was better by far it was more authentic and way better work and prices ! the only downfall was that there was only one artist working and at one point it got really hectic, but she even stayed late to finish all of ours ! i'm from vegas but i will definitely be coming back to the henna shoppe. beth was awesome ! very friendly and talented ! thanks for the beautiful henna !"
5-star,1,i've just finished getting the most beautiful henna tattoo on my hand. beth is an amazing artist and was able to work from a photo i supplied. thanks for a great experience!
1-star,0,"i visited the tempe location today there wasn't a artist available. i decided to go to the arrowhead location and get henna done. i told the artist irene that i wanted a hummingbird henna design and that i was having surgery next week and wanted to have henna done so i would have something pretty to look at while i was in the hospital. she then asked me ""is that your excuse for not working out?"" i asked her what she meant but she acted clueless. to let yelp readers know i am plus size and have lost weight and still have more to go. i was so shocked and disappointed that she had decided to make a passive aggressive mean comment to me when i was there for such a pretty thing. shocked!! such mean spirited comments defeat the spiritual journey of having henna done. hopefully next customers will have a better experience. paying $40 for insults is a bad feeling. also, this person is the store manager."
5-star,1,irene did a fantastic job! her enthusiasm for the craft was contagious. very knowledgeable and friendly! i got the darker henna which was an additional 10 per piece... totally worth it!!
5-star,1,"this is such an amazing store! the owner has reasonable prices because she wants to share with others, the employee's are so sweet, they make you feel so warm and welcome, irene was so patient and sooo helpful! we love henna thank you"
5-star,1,i got an amazing henna from the artist irene here at an increidble price. not only did she do a great job creating what i asked but she actually helped me pick out what i wanted. i would defiantly recommend getting henna and suggest finding irene for the job.
5-star,1,"i love this place. my sister and i got matching henna tattoos. jenna who is only 16 did the most beautiful job!!!! irene who was super funny did my sisters hand also did a gorgeous job. i am very pleased with their work and speed, can't wait to come back for more."
5-star,1,"irene is the best! she did some beautiful artwork of baby groot on my arm and a beautiful design on my niece! also, she was so kind to me when we were discussing my little brother's passing and my string of bad luck lately. if you're looking for something fun to do, get henna tattoos! so fun and not as expensive as anticipated! great experience and great prices."
5-star,1,hailey did an amazing job with my henna. i had her do a freestyle and it was the best thing i've ever seen. the amount of detail and how little time it took was perfect. she was also very kind and sweet. i plan to come back and tell all my friends about it.
5-star,1,hailey was an amazing person very nice person. love to talk to her and really respectful. she is an amazing artist. and she has a lot of patience. hailey is a really good worker. hailey doesn't mind how complicated or simple it is she has a smile on her face ready to do her job. i give her a 5star up for her art work and her dedication.
5-star,1,"first time getting henna since i was a little girl. irene greeted me with a warm hello instantly. great customer service, creative, and fast! it looked beautiful when i left the shop! i hope it lasts awhile :)"
5-star,1,"i passed the henna shoppe on the way in the mall and as i went into each store, my sister and i couldn't stop talking about getting one. we looked through the binder with multiple beautifully made designs, and i chose a $20 design. irene was so helpful and was very sweet. she is an amazing conversationalist, and it felt therapeutic as she made the design on my hand. i definitely will be coming back! me and my sister loved our designs!"
5-star,1,"irene did two hennas for us today; my daughter chose a beautiful hand design and i went with two super cute turtles. thank you for making her birthday special, irene!"
5-star,1,my daughter wanted a henna tattoo and we went to the henna shoppe in arrowhead mall. hailey was fantastic! i even got a free henna tattoo with the word of the day! definitely will go back to see hailey.
5-star,1,i stumbled across the henna place at the mall. hailey did an amazing job. her detail was extraordinary. i would recommend. fun experience.
5-star,1,"went here with my sisters and got amazing and beautiful henna, it lasted for at least 2 weeks. the staff was friendly and we really enjoyed ourselves!"
5-star,1,"jess did a henna on my foot free handed looks amazing, would recommend this place and her to anyone she was very friendly and fun to be around as well as all other employees in the store. made this experience even better!"
5-star,1,"julie was amazing, supper friendly! i love my henna and i'm super excited to see how it looks in a few days! she did an amazing job! prices are great and the atmosphere there is extremely friendly."
4-star,1,decent work but the prices are a little expensive. understandable though considering its in the mall. very modern and comfortable setting. not exactly what i expecting from a henna place but still satisfied.
5-star,1,"fantastic! these guys are incredibly easy to work with. inside the arrowhead mall, the henna shoppe is clean modern and inviting. they do fantastic work anyone should take the time to try something new and get an awesome hand drawn henna tattoo!"
5-star,1,i love this place the environment is amazing. everyone is so friendly and make the experience worth staying forever. i love the henna place anyone who loves art and great vibes check out the henna place.
5-star,1,my daughter was excited when we walked by and saw a place that offered henna tattoos. the owners were there and were beyond friendly and accommodating. megan did an amazing job with my daughter's henna tattoo. i would highly recommend them and we will definitely be back.
5-star,1,"i experienced the henna place as a client, where i am now an employee. i am basing my review solely on my experience as a client. i love all of the artists, and i find them all very talented. the energy they bring to their work is comforting and relaxed. the salon is beautifully designed and welcoming. i believe in this new business and i am 100% behind their vision and mission."
1-star,0,"my best friend and i came to las vegas for a short shopping trip. we are both avid hermes shoppers and looked forward to visiting the three hermes boutiques that are in such close proximity on the strip. we walked into the boutique at crystals. our excitement was palpable. the security guard returned the hello that we lobbed at him first. we walked past one salesperson who did her absolute best to avoid eye contact with us. she succeeded. no greeting. no acknowledgement of any kind. same with the second and third and fourth salesperson that we came into contact with. no ""hello"". no ""may i help you"". never have we ever received such horrendous service, and we have spent a small fortune with the brand over years. had this been my first impression of/experience with hermes, i would not spend a nickel on the brand. do better, hermes at crystals! your clients deserve it."
1-star,0,somewhere along the line these people confused high end with uppity. hermes is a great brand and it is unfortunate that the customer service at this location isn't on par with the quality of the product. i don't suspect my review will sway many but if i can convince one person not to go to this store (there are plenty of others in vegas) then my job is done.
1-star,0,the worst treatment in my life...no one greeted me and my fiancé and the only comment we got is to not take picture for a piece we were interested in...the lady yelled at us instead even to start greeting or apologizing for not taking pictures plz...i don't think this store represents hermès at all!...i had to go out of the store and not purchase anything
1-star,0,wow - for incredibly terrible service! there were at least 6 sales people chatting with each other in cliques around the store and not a single one bothered to greet me or offer to help. the only contact was the security who asked me to place my enclosed empty cup of tea on the table. felt so unwelcome i made the extra effort to walk to bellagio hermès for help despite staying next door at the mandarin and not much time. but i couldn't get anyone to look at me. weirdest and worst service i've experience in years. this store should be ashamed and the manager/employees should be fired considering this is not an isolated experience based others' review
1-star,0,every time that i am in vegas i stop by the hermes store and this time it was at the one in crystals shopping mall. never again! there was 6 people standing or sitting around the cash register talking with each other and never once asked if they could help us. we walked around until we found what i was looking for and picked it out and took it to the cash register to pay for it and had to ask someone to ring us up. when we commented on the service they then tried to be nice. sales associates at this location have the mentality that since they work for such a high caliber fashion house such as hermès they are better than thou and don't need to wait on anybody. the hermes store at the bellagio and the wynn provide excellent service.
5-star,1,"i was not really concerned about these negative reviews because i've always had excellent service hermes. this branch did not disappoint me. went in looking for a certain color shoe, they did not have it but the sales associate jennifer hughes was very helpful in trying to locate my color and size. although we were not successful she still represented herself and the company in the highest of standards set out by this brand. if you're a frequent buyer of hermes or new to the brand you shouldn't be put off by some of these negative comments. but it is vegas so i'm sure that has much to do with it."
1-star,0,"the sales people in this location are very judgmental. i came in yesterday with two kids in tow. i am in town for a conference and wanted to check out new items during my downtime. the moment i came in, this sales person looked at me from head to toe and asked sarcastically ""can i help you?"" maybe because i was wearing shorts, a tank top and flip flops or maybe i was with my girls (who, by the way, were well-behaved). the tone was very condescending. i said yes and started asking her a bunch of questions. she looked bored when i was talking but when i said i was at the saint honore store earlier this year (their flagship store), her tone changed. mind you that i was just at prada and the team over there are way more professional-even gave my girls a bottle of acqua panna. long story short, i did purchase two bottles of perfume but i will not spend my money with this brand anymore. customer service is key for me as i spend money with your brand. hermes - if you want people to represent your brand, find more competent and service oriented staff members."
1-star,0,"sales associates at this location have the mentality that since they work for such a high caliber fashion house such as hermès, they are next to gods and are curing cancer. i went in today inquiring about a few small leather goods that i saw on their site, i was not greeted, looked at or helped in any way. the security guy didn't even acknowledge my existence in there. i stood around waiting to see if i would eventually be helped, but sadly i wasn't. maybe i didn't look like i belonged in there (though i was wearing my chanel double flap bag) i was so frustrated that i just walked out. they lost a potential customer, one whom is considering investing in a birkin soon. oh well, i'll go the bellagio from now on."
1-star,0,"i wish i had read the reviews before even spending my time calling this store. i needed a replacement box for a scarf due to it being lost in my recent move to the area. they gave me a nonsensical reason for why they couldn't give me one. i've had to replace boxes and dust bags from other stores of this caliber and each one of them were more than happy to give me one to begin a personal relationship with me. they get it and in turn will receive my business. this hermes store doesn't, so they can do without it. reading that they seem to have an issue with minority clients doesn't inspire me to want to shop here."
1-star,0,i wish i had read the reviews before coming here. i picked out an item at the bellagio location with a wonderful associate but happened to be here right before my flight and wanted to make the purchase. the lady who pretended to help us was downright rude as the manager at the time pretty much told us she was right for not showing me the item. save your time and energy and go elsewhere.
1-star,0,"this review is for hermes (the shops at crystals). when i walked into the store, there was only one other customer who was being helped by an asian sales associate. two other employees were just chatting while i tried to make an eye contact to ask for help. they completely ignored me while i was standing 2 feet away. the asian sales assoc. who was helping other customer kept looking at me but didn't say anything. the security guard's eyes followed me everywhere as i was just looking at the displays waiting for someone to offer their service. i have never felt so disrespected at a shopping mall in my life! sorry i was dressed very casually in gym shoes carrying a backpack. i don't think hermes employees realize that some people don't like to get dressed up in designer clothes and carry luxury purses while on vacation. the whole point of my vacation is to relax, be comfortable, have fun and buy beautiful things. hermes employees at this location missed out on a big sales commission by judging me based on my appearance,."
5-star,1,"overdue review but necessary. this is a complimentary review for the sales associate, vanda who was very helpful in my purchase of a clic-clac h bracelet. my investigative self, seeked other stores (encore and bellagio) to find the particular type of bracelet i was looking for. low and behold, while none of the boutiques here had that bracelet in-house, neither would spend extra time or effort to find the item nearby....let's say crystals. so shout out to you, vanda at crystals, for giving me the time and patience for having the bracelet available for purchase."
1-star,0,"awful first experience. super disappointed. we were failed to be acknowledged at all while the sa pretended like they were busy when they really had nothing to do. we were ignored and we had to stand there looking awkward and clueless. at one point, one of the sa that was occupied called out for another person to help us and it took a long while even though she just told her she wasn't busy at all. when we finally got help, our sa rushed through the whole process including packaging, payment, rushing us out because they were closing. but honestly, if we didn't have to wait that long, you could've closed in time. colors and varieties were really limited too.... see, at vegas you would expect top notch customer service, especially high end stores but i was wrong. take your money elsewhere where you actually get some respect as a customer."
1-star,0,"if i could give this store a -5 star i would. the sales supervisor, dawn harrison smith, is rude, condescending and racist. now i understand why her sales reps behave the same way. they need to fire her and hire someone who respects and values their customers. as i was in the store, the sales reps and dawn only catered towards caucasians and ignored the rest. if you're not white, don't bother coming here. they'll treat you like insects. i was ready to spend $$$$ on a bag but i brought my business elsewhere instead."
5-star,1,"had a great cologne shopping experience. allison was very helpful from start to finish, and made the shopping experience comfortable. she has a vested in ensuring we purchased exactly what we wanted, and was well versed in the equine section. my girlfriend, being a rider, and her had awesome conversation, and she provided literature my girlfriend literature on their equine line. always a pleasure to go to hermes with staff like that!"
5-star,1,visited this store last weekend and was pleasantly surprised with the help and customer service i received. read the reviews and fortunately had a different experience here. i was able to purchase the exact items i was looking for (not common) and the sa made it really easy! thanks a!
1-star,0,"so disappointed in the lack of service at hermes at city center on saturday. there were plenty of employees on the floor and very few customers, yet no one even greeted us. we were prepared to buy, but walked out. there are plenty of other retailers that welcome and appreciate the business. (thanks barney's, christian louboutin, chanel, lv, and red valentino)."
5-star,1,"we stopped at this hermes store on our way to le cirque. the staff was very attentive, but not pushy as is often the case in ultra high end retail stores. my wife was able to try on a variety of beautiful scarves, but we were never once pressured or made uncomfortable. highly recommended if you're looking for high end attire!"
5-star,1,got my first birkin here and only had to wait like 7 months! ladies put your name down at this location if you don't wanna wait 2+ years. the hermes in my hometown san diego said i would be lucky if i got one in under 2 years.
1-star,0,"ugh! my sister was in town and she loves to browse at the upscale shops. we walked into hermes and we noticed ""sales people"" just standing around. we got no smile, no greeting, no welcome. children of the corn! we started browsing looking at the leather goods inside the glass cases and then one ""lady"" started following us (just in case us mexicans might steal something). this former prison guard never asked if she could help us, she just followed us. then i asked her a question and she answered in a bored manner while looking out the window and never making eye contact with me. the only thing this dumb dumb didn't do was start filing her nails and popping her gum. i thought for sure that was next. this ex-prison guard would be more excited to get a colonoscopy than to work here. no wonder oprah won't carry a hermes bag anymore! (the way she was treated in zurich it's no surprise). don't let this group of grouches ruin your fabulous shopping day...just keep walking to dior or lanvin, or gucci, or tiffany or dolce, or burberry, or ... zara! honey, this is las vegas! there are so many other wonderful shops where you'll be treated like the king and queen that you are. don't do it here! run away from cell block h."
2-star,0,"2 stars because i was finally acknowledged after 5 min of being eye balled and stalked by a rep. i had to ask of course. i've been to the encore and have had 2 lovely encounters with the sa's there that were very helpful and eagerly assisted me with a smile .it was quite opposite at crystals when visiting my first time. they do have a larger selection which is appealing. the sales assistant chatted very lightly but didn't seem too interested in showing me much. my fiance walked out of the store because of the not welcome vibe he picked up from the women. i also walked out after noticing the snooty looks i was given by the other 2 girls behind the counter. maybe if i wore my jimmy choos and my hermes dress instead of my jeans, could i have been treated with a little higher regard."
1-star,0,"my friend and i waited ten minutes before their doors opened and once opened we were the first and only customers. we were immediately greeted by a sales lady and she attempted to help my friend who wanted to check on the status of a wallet she had pre-ordered with another sales rep (will refrain from using names) who happened to be on vacation. so my friend was sad that her wallet wasn't in yet but still wanted to leave with something so she decided to get a belt and asked to see such. we were led to the back of the store where a nice belt in hermes orange box was presented. as for the buckles, we were only offered two (1 in chrome finish and 1 in brushed finish). my friend asked my advice and i was not impressed with either so i asked the lady if they had something more interested for instance if the h buckle came in half chrome, half brushed look. she says that they actually have several more with textured finishes but they were more expensive. immediately my friend felt insulted. maybe our casual blouse and jeans blew any chance of receiving high end service. mind you, my friend who lives in a million plus dollar home, owns a $100k mercedes sclass amg, had previously purchased a 5figure handbag from this company, was carrying a several thousand dollar channel handbag, sporting carats of diamonds on finger and ears and yet was judged that maybe she couldn't afford a belt buckle that was priced $60 more? lucky for this sales lady, my friend is a nice person and went ahead with the $800 belt which she paid for in cash. but she was nonetheless offended and took our business to another nearby boutique. lesson be learned, don't judge a person no matter what. per juilia roberts in the movie pretty woman, ""big mistake. huge. sorry gotta do more shopping."""
3-star,0,"came into this boutique yesterday and upon entering, all the salesperson greeted me, but one saleslady just had to scanned me from my top, to my bag, and onto my shoes. hello!?! you greet by making eye contact lady! gosh, i wonder if the company put these sales people to customer service 101. anyways, the salesperson that i usually here to see is helping another customer so i sat down on one of the comfy sofa and peruse the catalog. some clothes are really classy and elegant, some are just outright strange looking. they also just came out with accessories for your accessories...such as a cute little horsey made of the same leather as the hermes bag, to attach to the hermes bag. price? $485. cute, but not worth it to me."
2-star,0,"courtesy and respect is a no#1 priority no matter what store you are in. however, that was not the case for this hermes store. as i went in, the majority of the the salespeople were fine. however, there was this one lady that was rude to me. i was looking and trying on leather bracelets, and i also wanted to know the price for both of them. we were conversing in cantonese, and in the end, she made a rude comment to me, saying that ""our customers never ask for the price; they only come to look at the designs."" that was just beyond rude. seriously, if you don't have anything nice to say, please don't say anything."
3-star,0,this is the newest hermes store in las vegas (the one in bellagio is closed for remodeling). i was expecting a fab collection of all things hermes. i was left disappointed. it is sparse at best. a tiny selection of leather goods. most bags on display were canvas. it was a bit sad.
2-star,0,"boo!!! hermes, you fudged up big time by moving to crystals. gah, i hate that place. i cannot come visit you, and after seeing your sparse, annoyingly small boutique (more like a booth with walls). you were so perfect at the bellagio."
4-star,1,"for a city like las vegas, where every hotel & show is blown up to a grand, impressive scale, the new hermès boutique in the crystals shopping center is surprisingly small. the layout of the display cases is a little awkward as well - everything is very visible and sort of laid bare for anyone passing by to see, in a way. all in all, i have to say i didn't feel the cozy, welcoming ambiance that i usually get from the other hermès boutiques. there seemed to be an overabundance of hard, shiny surfaces that reflected sound & light a little too harshly for my tastes. of course, the items themselves are lovely as ever, but if you're looking for the more traditional h shopping experience, i would recommend sticking with one of the other locations."
5-star,1,"i've been collecting hermes accessories since the late 90's. back then, i never knew what it meant or why my mother would scream at me if i mistreated a silk scarf or ripped a hole in a pair of gloves. i just thought they were ""pretty things"" and never paid no mind to them. a decade and some more later... i know why my mother would take such good care of her hermes accessories. it's the quality of the items. it's the beautifully crafted and well thought-out designs of each of their pieces. specifically- the vibrant color/ print of each scarf (the navy and emerald green is my fav.) and the classic style of each handbag. i simply enjoy shopping at this small-but-wonderful boutique in vegas. i might like it even more than the store in la. =) my mother shops here every year on her annual trip to reno and vegas with the pops. she still values hermes as a timeless brand; i happen to agree with her as well."
1-star,0,"i wish i would have been lucky enough to come in on a day when the staff felt like treating customers with courtesy and respect. i walked in with my sisters and my fiance earlier this month. one of my sisters and me have always toyed with the idea of owning a birkin bag so we wanted to personally see if it was truly worth all the fuss. well, i'm not sure if i plan on ever getting one based on the way we were treated once we entered the boutique. we were the only ones in the entire store and there were two women standing behind the counter, an older white woman and a filipino woman. they barely glanced at us, much less greet us, when we walked in, even though they weren't doing anything. i lingered around the scarves for awhile, then the bags, waiting for someone to ask if i needed help. never happened. after about 10 minutes of being completely ignored, we decided it was time to leave. news flash to bitchy luxury salespeople out there: just because you sell luxury goods doesn't mean you're worth more than the customers coming in to buy them. (i get the same treatment from gucci, btw. louis vuitton, dior, and chanel, on the other hand, have superb customer service because their salespeople understand the meaning of commision. but that's a whole 'nother story.) i didn't care much for their bag collection, the colors that they had available seemed rather drab, in my opinion. and although my family and i do drop serious bank on luxury goods now and then, i realize that in the end, a purse is a purse. whether you get it from hermes or target. to tell you the truth, it takes some kind of a**hole to buy a bag worth as much as a car just to shove their financial superiority (or major debt) in other people's faces. i mean, what other purpose would purchasing a $14k (and up) purse serve? personally, i just don't feel like being that kind of a**hole."
5-star,1,"small boutique, but has the nicest sales associates of any hermes i've been to. i looked at several of their ribbed silk scarves, but am having a hard time picking out a color. the sales woman put several around my neck and showed me all the different ways to tie them. i wanted to hug her. this store carries bags, scarves, enamel bracelets and fragrance. they're hoping you win big and spend here. :)"
4-star,1,hollister&co???????eaton centre?????fairview mall?hollister&co?????????????????????????????????????????????????fitting room????????????????????????????????
1-star,0,"i went to hollister around 8:45 pm this past friday and bought a top. the girl at cash told me the total and i inserted my card to pay. i then saw the ""approved"" sign and took my card out - i was putting my card away in my wallet and the girl told me that it didn't go through and that i had to pay. i told her that i saw the ""approved"" sign, she said no. in any case, i put my card in and paid again. while she was getting the receipt, i decided to log into my online banking. i found 2 hollister transactions- she didn't say anything and i walked away. how does a cashier not pay attention when she's working? if i'm showing you that i paid already, why are you telling me to pay. i'll just never go into hollister again - the workers are young and rude."
1-star,0,"poor poor customer service! i waited in a short line, which was only me and a lady with a big stroller in front of me. the stroller was huge and it totally blocked the left side (which is usually where ppl line up from) so i lined after the lady from the middle. 10 mins later i was told by a middle aged cashier in a rude tone, ""you have to line up from the left hand side! "" ok, so i walked around and still lined up after the lady with the baby stroller. a cashier called out ""next!"" to me, i tried moving over but the lady's stroller was way too big it blocked the entire path (and you guys must know how it's like to move between racks at hollister, very narrow, you have to squeeze), i waited a bit trying to figure out how could i move over, then the cashier called to me impatiently again, so i ended up circling around back to where i used to line (which is from the middle) and i felt such a waste of effort!"
1-star,0,"personally i don't know what people see in this store, it's just low quality garments being charged way over price. i would never pay a hundred bucks for a pair of jeans with holes all over the place, but that's just me. when you walk into the store they have ""greeters"" that stand outside and scan everyone who walks into the store. it's so busy and there is absolutely no place to move around in the store not to mention that forgot the lights in this store. how are you suppose to shop in the dark? all the clothes are stacked on shelves which i find extremely hard to shop with everything just piled on shelves, and especially when there is no lighting. the perfume they spray in this store makes you think maybe you are in a perfume warehouse and become lost in all this darkness. even if you wanted to buy something from this store, the lines are always out of wack and you will be waiting a while..."
1-star,0,"another one in the long road to nowhere in developing a 'look'. it is not by printing the name of a place in california, on a t-shirt, that it becomes a fashion item. there must be a 'cemetery' of all the names that have come before and are no longer selling. there has to be a qualitative difference between products, and it is totally cynical to expect that they will be bought simply because they have a name. this has been the road to perdition for a long list of brands, which have come and gone. in addition, when these brands open stores that feature their undifferentiated clothing, they are singularly uninspired. there is so much great fashion available out there. independents in toronto offer novel garments with both eye appeal and quality. some of the old standby retailers have upgraded their look and built more fashion as well as quality in. why another bland store, just repeating the pattern once more? i guess its a case of the bland leading the bland. here is just a short incomplete list of lines that have seen their 'arc' come tumbling down: vuarnet chip and pepper vondutch northbound brandx k-swiss .... you can add your own to the list or vote with your pocketbooks and decide to dress well. it will take more time and effort, but you will stand out."
5-star,1,"adorable little shop! tucked away in the aj's complex. the prices are reasonable, and the staff/ owner is always offering to help. remember to keep your receipt! ask about their points program, great way to get a little discount on some lovely clothes. overall, i've had several great experiences there."
5-star,1,"after a bad experience i had at another boutique in the same plaza, i stumbled into hot petunias and i knew right away that i was in the right place. i was greeted straight away by a friendly and helpful associate who sized me up and started showing me one after another fabulous outfits. i had fun there trying on different things and wound up buying three great dresses. great customer service! 5- stars for sure!"
2-star,0,"beware. super cute boutique but they have no return policy and a 10-day exchange policy that they will not budge on. first time shopping there and i needed to exchange part of my purchase. had i been made aware of that, i would never have purchased as i was tied up at events for the next two weeks. very disappointed because i thought i found a great place to shop at."
1-star,0,"their return policy is as bad as it gets. we bought around 240 bucks worth of clothes from this place, and the tags said everything was refundable. we brought the stuff home and some of it didn't fit so we brought it back 2 days later, only to be told by the sales associate that nothing was refundable and we would only be receiving store credit. we had the receipt and everything, nothing was damaged at all. the lady claimed that she told us their return policy, but that's ver confusing considering the tags said it was refundable. also, one of the dresses we bought got fabric residue stains on my new purse, phone case, and skin. will not be going back here, very much a scam."
5-star,1,"stopped in to find a gift for my girlfriend and not only had a great conversation with the owner, but found a nice scarf for my girlfriend. absolutely love this place. will definitely be back soon for christmas shopping!"
1-star,0,"zero return policy is wrong!!! i have been a customer since 2011 and only had a brief time when i didn't shop at this boutique while i was pregnant with my twins. now my twins are 8 months old and i stopped by and quickly bought a dress from the window. having shopped there in the past, i had bought items and returned them, no problems before. i am one of those shoppers who need to try things on at home and this time my husband did not like this dress that i bought. i quickly returned it early the very next day and they would not issue me a refund and only gave me a store credit and basically scolded me for not reading my receipt? what? i wear reading glasses and no, i did not read my receipt, nor did they tell me about there new return policy which is zero returns!!!!!! they issued me a store credit was all they said they could do and basically made me feel bad about it and said it was all my fault. how is it that you buy something and then it's on the receipt that they have a zero return policy? that is not fair. you should make your sign larger and place it in all the dressing rooms so we can see it and read it. i had no idea when i bought this dress that i couldn't return it because my last experiences, a year and a half ago were good. what if this business closes it's doors and i only have a in store credit? this is not fair to the consumer! i would like my money back please!"
5-star,1,this is the perfect boutique to find a great outfit! they have very cute clothes and not to mention affordable! being in scottsdale...it gets old when every boutique is so overpriced! trust me it's worth the quick peak...but guaranteed it won't be quick ;) it's just refreshing to buy cute clothes at reasonable prices. oh and the service is great too!
5-star,1,"darling, not stuffy, well priced, boutique!! met the owner twice now, and she's very nice. looking forward to having a close by shop with great stuff."
1-star,0,blue haired cashier lady needs to be fired. she has a horrible attitude she refused service cuz my dad threw money at her apparently. she was negative the whole time. argued with me about that situation she's not a good person for customer service. manager was amazing but the blue haired lady was rude and needs to be fired
1-star,0,"at first the customer service seemed good but it was a lie. she we walked in the store the girl said we can get 25% off everything we can stuff in a bag if we bought the bag. after an hour of shopping for stuff we wanted, the line was huge as they were not checking people out fast enough. then we go to check out and the cashier says that we can't get the discount on the items we bought. super pissed off now, i told her that's not what the other lady said, she didn't seem to care. so basically i will never shop at this brand again. they need to get it togther."
1-star,0,"i came by hot topic and found a tank for dia de los muertos today and was stoked to find something while on vacation. first of all this store is a mess, and the employees didn't seem helpful. i was standing waiting for a fitting room and not acknowledged as workers passed by a few times. i finally got to sneak into the only fitting room they had once somebody left the fitting room to try on two sizes. excited to purchase it i headed for the cash register and the girl working it was ignoring me looking down at her paper as i was right standing in front her. after awhile she finally glared at me and said she could ring me. she then bugged me four times to buy a second item to get half off the second item. i said no thanks because i only needed one item and then i headed out happy to get out of there with my new buy. then i realized as i left the mall and was in the parking lot i took off my priceless sunglasses when trying my top on. i hauled back to the store the ""alarm"" was going off. luckily nobody went into the the fitting room i grabbed my shades and stormed out. ""beep, beep, beep!!!"".. again and so i had i felt my bag and my ""favorite"" cashier left the security tag on :( just my luck i had to go back inside and the other cashier was pleasant and apologized as she removed the security tag and the chick who helped me didn't say sorry and was being awkward."
1-star,0,"this store is absolutely disgusting. nothing is in the right spot, the staff is frazzled, and everything is so close together that if there are two people in the store you can't help but bump into them. boxes are half open, i am certain the shrinkage in this store is huge, and the prices are high for the quality. why, you ask, did i even enter this den of despair? because they sucker my tween in with minecraft, pokemon, and my little pony paraphernalia. however, this store is the worst hot topic i have been to."
1-star,0,"we were greeted at the door so that was nice. i waited patiently to have an associate get a shirt off the top rack and was ignored. then, my friend goes to pay and they ran out of change. i have never been to a hot topic in my life and even with super cute the breakfast club items, i would not return."
4-star,1,the staff was friendly and even searched for an item i had been looking for. they found the last one they had in the store for me.
4-star,1,several sales staff on the floor and the male staff amused me in answering my questions. think i might have made him feel uncomfortable when i asked about his ear and the spacer size he was at. if nothing else i got a kick out of it. :-) not a store i would buy things for myself anymore but could find things here for others.
1-star,0,so the only thing i ever go into hot topic for is jewelry for my piercings. my sister and i always go to the galleria mall because it usually has the best stuff. however i honestly think that the sales associates at this hot topic are lacking an i.q. i have been there so many times and when i need someone to show me jewelry i look around and they are all talking. i see none actually helping customers at the long line at the register. one experience in particular i wanted to buy a nose stud so i went up to a male sales associate and asked him to open it for me. i walked back to the stand thinking he was coming and he was just looking at me. then he continued with his conversation and ignored what i had just asked. i was shocked so i kept staring to see if he was coming. i went up to him again and asked him if he even worked there and he said yes. then i asked why he hadn't opened the jewelry case like i had politely asked him to. he then had the nerve to say that he though i was staring at him...he thought i was hitting on him. i just left the store and never went back.
1-star,0,came in and we were happily unwelcomed! the girls ignored us and then as i was looking at a bra in a package so i carefully opened the package to look at it before purchase and some little snobby girl comes up and rudely tells us we ate not allowed to open it and read the sign! there was no sign displayed where i was it was at the opposite end. i would never go back in this store and will tell all my girlfriends to stay away from here! there are too many good options in the area where you are welcomed as a customer! if i could give a 0 star i would!
1-star,0,"it's true, their customer service sucks. it's not the fact that they ignore you, because sometimes, we just like to be left alone and shop for ourselves. what i didn't like was that they made it obvious they're pretending to straighten the racks while closely following me around. please little girls, you need better loss prevention tactics than that. i've worked in retail before, i'm on to you. my handbags costs more than your entire paycheck so go and take a seat. i was asked multiple times if i was ready for the fitting rooms. i didn't have an armful of clothes, just one item. relax. so when i was finally ready to purchase said item, there was nobody at the cash register. hellooooo i'm standing in front of your cash wrap....do you not see me? they must be ocd about straighten up the store versus processing a transaction. i waited and waited until i had to tell a sales associate i'm ready to be rung up. the cashier was clueless on how to process my transaction using a visa gift card (in case any of you little girls who work here are reading this: there's already money on it. it's a gift card. process it like a normal credit card. no it's not a debit card, i don't have a pin number. no you don't need to see my id. it's a visa gift card. it says ""gift recipient"" on the card, my first and last name won't be on it.) won't be shopping at any of the hotties in town. they're all just as bad. i've read those reviews. i only came to check this place out because i was running errands in the same plaza this store is in."
1-star,0,the absolute worst place to shop. ..extremely rude and a bunch of inexperienced teenagers who haven't any clue about customer service. ...this is for the staff who was there in february...i wrote a more detailed review then but took it down because i am going to sue them...i can't day for what right now but depending on my attorney advice we are going public...this place is shameful. ..they need to pack up shop and be removed from boca because they do not belong there.
5-star,1,came the store twice to pick up for some casual wears and ended up buying more than i should! the workers were all so helpful and asked if i needed help and set up dressing room for me when i needed. would definitely return to shop again!
1-star,0,"terrible place! they don't let exchange shoes for different size the same day or purchase and also the shoes had diffract. oh, and there us no one to help! there is no customer service!!!!! there is no phone number to call at all"
1-star,0,"the customer service here is a complete joke. all of the girls who work there except for maybe one or two of them, are so incredibly rude. i had called in earlier that day to see if there were off the shoulder tops and the girl talking on the phone was not only rude, but was also talking to her co-worker while on the phone with me. very unprofessional no matter where you work. her exact words to her co-worker were, ""oh no way dude."" i was in shock. when the girl was explaining the tops they had that were similar to what i was looking for, she had an attitude and sounded like she was 12 on the phone. so since she didn't help me find what i was looking for whatsoever, i had to come into the store to look myself. when i came in an employee was standing right by the door, was on her phone, and did not greet me. i work in retail myself and would never imagine not greeting a customer or would ever dream of being on my phone! crazy. so, after finding a top i liked, i needed to run into another store just to see bottoms that would match the top. when i asked to put it on hold for about 20 mins until i came back, (what seemed to be) the manager rolled her eyes and said, ""um, well are you going to come back?"" and i replied with a yes. she ignored me and turned her back to me. i asked if she needed my name just in case and she said no and turned back around. i am at a loss for words with how unprofessional the employees are."
4-star,1,"i love this store and this location is a bit busy to find a parking. they have cute and sexy clothing - dress, tank tops, pants, skirts and also shoes, jewelleries, lingerie, etc. i buy a lot of clothes from hottie. the customer service is ok. the clothing is not pricey in my opinion but sometimes you will find some pieces does not have good quality esp clothing that have jewelleries on it breaks. they don't have any reward program, wish they did. they also don't call another store for the size i was looking for. most sales are final so make sure you like it."
1-star,0,"horrible experience. i shopped at the hottie store, once every 2-3 weeks, their staffs just want to get sales in. customer service is absolutely horrible and no one is helpful. i bought a pair of shoes which i decided to return it after trying it on again at home to walk around and the shoes gave me blisters all over my feet. just 3 hours later i went to the location on flamingo right by my house and the assistant manager said, she will not refund it and she cannot call the other store for me!!! lmaooo!!! i contacted the store in rampart where i originally made the purchase and spoke to cassandra, she said, she will call me back after speaking to her manager. she called me within two minutes and said she heard a recording that she has told me sales are final, i informed i'm on my way to store and she can play the recording for me. she said she will not!!! i asked to speak with a manager and responded, there is no manager in the store. when few minutes back she said she will speak to one and call me back!! the other store was only 5-7 minutes away as soon as i walked in, they told me cassandra just went on break!!! how convenient!!! i asked for manager's business card, they said she doesnt have one!! how messed up is it that a store manager does not have a business card??!! i left the pair of shoes and will be calling the bank to dispute the transaction. the staffs were lying and my purchase was only within hours and on same day!! its not like the shoes was in a bad condition and i went weeks or days after, to return it... f***cked up client service. i left my phone number,, so lets see if the manager will contact me which she never did."
4-star,1,"i'm not sure where all of the negative reviews are coming from. lol i've honestly browsed this school since middle school, but being older (23) now i can honestly buy the clothing now that it's more age appropriate. this past weekend i was visiting vegas - i moved to california but regardless - and my friend and i decided to go to hottie. we've never been disappointed before and we needed an outfit to go out on saturday. my review is for the customer service, but specifically for tay. i believe that's the name she goes by. this is a small description, but she's a petite, brunette, caucasian woman who wears glasses. she looks about 19 or 20. she helped my friend and i out so much, from finding shoes to go with the outfit that i had tried on to finding the shirt i really loved that wasn't damaged and still units packaging. also, she gave us honest opinions on our outfit choice, and she wasn't pushy in terms of what we should buy from the store, and some sales associates can be like that. i really appreciated tay's service. what stood out to me was the patience she had with my friend and i, but specifically me as i can be indecisive. thank you so much tay! oh made the experience amazing. if a manager is reading this, tay is awesome! now for the clothing, they have a great sale section. the items are affordable and a good mix of basic pieces along with club wear and sexy casual wear. i bought a midi maroon skirt for only $9. there are very cute bustier tops with jewels on them for an awesome price. i love that this store caters to almost every customer, although i'm not sure that i would ever buy their sports wear. the store associates were very attentive to my friend and i. they offered to start a fitting room for us as soon as they saw us with a lot of the items in our hands. i like that i was greeted upon entering the store. one thing that would really be a nice add on is if i would have been able to find someone when i needed to reach items higher up. it can be hard to spot a sales associate at times because they blend in, but everyone was wearing great, fashionable and appropriate clothing. thanks a ton! i will definitely be back in here when i come back to visit."
1-star,0,"i had a very terrible experience at this store and i honestly would not recommend shopping there. the return policy is absolutely terrible. it's even worse because i was not notified about the return policy when i made my $80 purchase. a professional business will notify the customer of the return policy before the customer makes the purchase so they are aware, however the woman who checked me out never even told me about the policy. so when i came back to make a return for my expected refund, she said i could only get store credit. this greatly upset me because i was never made aware of the policy. when i confronted her, she said that the policy is on the receipt, which is totally irrelevant at that point because once you're given a receipt, you've already made the purchase, so her argument was completely void. she then took down my name and number for my store credit, and when i came back to redeem it they said they didn't have my information and just ignored me after. bottom line, the customer service is very bad, the clothes are not especially unique, and i will never step foot into that store again. thats $40 down the drain for me."
4-star,1,"i don't know what all the negative reviews are about, hottie is one of my favorite stores. i've never been treated unfairly at this location and the cashiers always make sure to tell me the return, or rather no-return policy. only giving four stars because yes this store, years ago, used to have much higher quality clothes and was more of a boutique. now they seem to be carrying quantity over quality but i still like most things they have."
1-star,0,"walking in, the store has very cute clothes. the clothes were not the problem, but the customer service sucked! when my mom and i asked for a fitting room so she can try on some items, we wanted to enter the same room (it's easier to give opinions in a closed room instead of having to step out after every outfit change). apparently that is not allowed, but the employee kept hovering and would not leave us alone while we were in the dressing room, along with after when we exited the room. i understand the threat shoplifters pose to the business, but not every person that walks in has the intention of shoplifting. we were so uncomfortable that we put down what we were going to purchase and left. i don't appreciate being treated like a criminal. learn how to treat your customers. i refuse to give money to a business with such crappy customer service."
1-star,0,"i'm aware of the return policy although i do think every customer deserves a full return for unworn items. i love this store a lot, the prices are reasonable & the clothing and shoes are so cute but it's impossible to shop here because when you are shopping the staff seriously makes you feel like a criminal. everytime i'm there they follow me, stare at me, etc. these girls will seriously hide in racks to make sure you aren't stealing lol. they ask me everytime i pick something off a hook if they can take it to the fitting room. seriously i'm here shopping and i have my baby with me, stop treating customers like this. & let us shop in peace. oh and last thing, snobby girls as staff."
1-star,0,"if i could give 0 stars i would. worst customer service ever! when i bought a dress there i specifically asked if i decided to bring the dress back could i get my money back. the little girl behind the counter clearly said yes. i brought the dress back and was told that either exchange or store credit only... in a condescending manner. this was my first and last time shopping here. even if you shop online stores they offer a full refund if you aren't satisfied. it's called customer retention. apparently, hotties does not care to keep customers coming back."
1-star,0,i usually find really cute things at hottie stores but it's gotten to the point where i can't even shop here anymore. the girls in the store ask so many times if i need help and as soon as i pick up an item i get asked if i need a dressing room. i ended up trying some things on today and settled on a pair of pants. i was walking around the store and the sales girl literally asked if i was going to buy the pants as i'm trying to find a top. you literally can't shop here without being bombarded. too bad. today was the last straw won't be shopping here anymore.
1-star,0,"worst customer service ever!!! asked what the return policy was and the girl told me full refund with receipt. asked her 2x to make sure. when i went to return a shirt they would only give me store credit even when i had the receipt but claimed ""cause they had a sign posted so nothing they can do."" even though the same employee who told me the return policy told her manager that she said i could get a refund. they still wouldn't do anything. first time shopping there and forever my last!!! ran like a mom and pop store. train your managers on using judgement calls and training your own team you own return policy!!!"
5-star,1,"cute clothes that not everyone else will have! they have a ton of sexy dresses, rompers, tank tops, crop tops, bustiers, and shoes. their heels are probably my favorite. and the sales are pretty reasonable too, with a huge selection. staff have always greeted me and been very nice as well."
1-star,0,"i have never had anyone ask to help me. things seem over priced for quality. bought a shirt online and was damaged. it also didn't fit well so i returned it. they said they wouldn't return it. i am aware this is their policy but wouldn't even give me a credit. so i thought give it back and i'll donate it. nope i would be charged shipping and handling. for an item i don't like, is poor quality and damaged. nope won't give this business anymore of mine ever!"
4-star,1,i love this place! i wish there were hotties in my area. this place is better than forever 21 and much more organized. love their velour track suits here.
4-star,1,"i like hottie's for the location convenience. i'm not a huge shopper or a fashionista and i don't like going to the mall. i'm just your average girl who likes sweater and jeans in the winter and dresses in the summer. i don't do crazy prints and i'm pretty boring in my color selections. however, if i ever need something to wear to go out, i check out hottie's. sometimes i find something, sometimes i don't. there's a lot of clothes on the rack and you just need to sort through them to find treasure or whatever meets your needs. overall, somethings can be fairly cheap and somethings are pricey, but i will be back for more!"
1-star,0,"one star for freaking rudeness. word to the wise hottie that in this economy every person that walks through your front door should be acknowledge by your chicken-heads staff. i was never acknowledged, but i noticed that a woman who was of caucasian persuasion was greeted very warmly. i immediately knew i was not spending my green dollars where my business was not welcomed. i am a woman of color, and i noticed when i entered some other boutiques in the area i was immediately recognized, and greeted. sad that in this day, and age some idiots think some people are not worthy as consumers. your loss hottie, and your disposal clothes are not worthy to be part of my closet."
4-star,1,"sometimes a girl just needs a ten dollar shirt to go with her three hundred dollar shoes. hottie fills the need of the last minute outfit or dress when one simply cannot find something to wear in her closet. this women's clothing store always has selections of colorful, trendy, fun stuff. i love running in at the last minute to grab a little dress for dinner or a great necklace to finish off an outfit. they do have shoes, if your in dire need of a pair, although it isn't usually my reason for going there. they have absolutely divine summer dresses and tunics. with a couple in the valley and usually off the strip, this place is great for us locals when we have been invited to dinner at the last minute!!"
2-star,0,do not go shopping at this bay location on a monday and expect to have sales people available to help you or even fitting rooms open in the ladies department. this store is so understaffed it is no wonder they are losing sales. some of us prefer not to shop on the weekend when it is busy but we still would like a fitting room open should we find something we'd like to try on when we do shop.
2-star,0,"this review is for the clinique counter. just terrible in general. i've come to this counter on a number of occasions and not once has anyone come approach me for help. if it not for sephora not carrying a lot of their products i wouldn't come here if i could help it. the bay is going the way of the dinosaur if they can't ramp up their customer service the way nordstrom, holt renfrew, and sephora treat their customers. my last visit here i waited at least a good 7-10 minutes before i decided to just leave and order online. the sa was clearly there just unpacking christmas packages and not interested in helping me at all. can you see people hanging around your counter in the corner of your eye? i'm sure you can! all it takes is a hello, and could you wait a sec i'll be right there! the bay is intimidating for the average consumer to shopping in. no one needs this kind of treatment or service."
1-star,0,"watch repair: this review is specific to watch repair. the prices have consistently gone up and are now $16.99. they are very slow and usually a line for some reason. go to the ""watch it"" store just a 5 minute walk down the mall. they are at least $2 cheaper and are quick and friendly. they both use swiss renata batteries."
1-star,0,this is a fadulent company that charges credit cards of customers and never processes the online orders. please do not buy online!
4-star,1,"haven't been to the bay in forever. not sure why? i was on a mission since i saw a dress in a magazine and after some research, found out the bay carried it. looked around for a while since i couldn't find it any where and thought i better ask someone. i was directed to the section that would carry that brand and looked some more..... no success finding the dress in the inc. section. a bit of a bummer! after not finding the dress, i thought i would look around at the rest of the bay to see what else they carry? they do have some cute stuff woman's clothing wise but nothing i was dying to buy. the staff was friendly and i will admit every section i did go into, if there was staff i was greeted. always nice. went to fragrance section and did end up buying some stuff, so not a total bust of a shopping experience. didn't find the dress i was looking for, but will be back another time."
4-star,1,"i don't see the need for all the hate on the bay! i enjoy this location because it is less busy than the one downtown or at chinook, usually. i agree with melissa's advice, never to purchase something full price at the bay. they tend to have killer sales if you wait for them. just this week, i scored a pair of half price vegan boots...at this price, i won't feel bad if i have to pay to get them resoled in the future, or if i buy a new pair next year, as many comparable fashion boots from other stores come with quite a high price tag. i do miss when the bay used to carry levi's jeans which they phased out of this year, because i became accustomed to buying my favourites there for about $30 whenever there was a bay days sale. i noticed most of the complaints revolve around the cosmetics counters in other reviews, which i can't really speak to. when mac was still cruelty free, i found the girls at the bay here really friendly. the counter was usually fully staffed and i always chose this over the other mac location in the mall. now that they aren't, however, i take my makeup needs to sephora or teh interwebz. you're alright, the bay. *review 2/30 of yelp's 30 day challenge 2012"
1-star,0,"i shopped once at clinique but it wasn't great never go back. first of all, i guess it is not a busy counter at all. i have not seen many customers when i every time i pass there. i know now why. the sa has horrible manner. no knowledge about their products. they can not even find a match for my foundation. a sa called me ""insane"" when i returned the product.rude. i would go to sephora instead they carry fresher stocks and sa are nicer."
4-star,1,"my wardrobe is full of great clothes that i bought at the bay. even as a high school student i knew how to make the most of their sales (my grad dress was from the bay - regularly $220 on sale for $56 at the last minute!), and i've been devoting an hour or two to their end-of-season sale racks each season since. just last week i was in the bay at market mall and found a beautiful, on-trend blazer (perfect for transitioning into fall) that was regularly $198, marked down to $58, plus an extra 50% off the last marked price! the trick at the bay is never to buy anything full price, and to go prepared to sort through the disastrously-organized higher-end sale racks (rachel roy, halston heritage, calvin klein, bcbg generation, etc.). skip all of their house brands, don't expect the employees to be able to provide accurate information, and prepare to wait in endless lines at the cash register... and you'll get great clothes at prices so low you'll feel like you need to run out to your car before the cashier realizes she's made a mistake!"
2-star,0,"it's not like you'll often catch me in the bay, but for a very specific couple of reasons, i needed to make the special trip into this department store yesterday evening. first of all, can i just say how oddly dispersed their staff was? in some areas there were 3 people too many, and in some other areas, there was only one person, who happened to be giving a makeover and couldn't help me with what i needed to purchase. it's not like i was that customer that needed them to explain all the different products to me, i knew exactly what i wanted, who makes it and where it's available. i just needed them to ring it through and take my money. when i did finally get some service, the woman totally passed me up to another staff member. she was ridiculously snooty, and unsurprisingly, so was the other staff member that she had passed me over too. then i continued to look around in the fragrance section and i felt like i was being watched like a hawk. the bay staff kept hoarding around as though i was 4 years old and about to break something. finally a man looked me right in the eyes and said ""do you have any questions?"" i was like ""uh no...."" proving to him that i was fully capable of speaking and asking for help if i required it. for the time that i was in the bay, i felt like i had stumbled into a realm where it's a prerequisite for everyone to be snooty, rude and full of themselves. last night helped me discover why i am not an avid shopper at the bay. the chances of you catching me in there ever again are slim to none."
1-star,0,if i could put no stars i would. i ordered 10 shirts online and when i got my package today it was missing 1 shirt. i called the online number and was told there was nothing they could do except refund my money i asked if i could just have the order shipped only if i paid again for it i said i already paid for it and got the run around i will never ever shop penny's again!!!!!!!!!!
2-star,0,"ive gone to this jcpenney multiple times for many years and never had a bad experience. but today when i was in line i was very uncomfortable because this worker maryland was very rushed and was constantly complaining about it being busy and how thy are understaffed. she was like almost crying in her hands and saying to everyone ""im sorry for the wait were very understaffed and busy and im trying i know im trying"" when there was nobody complaining or even impatient. the three people in line were very calm including me and she just was very unprofessional and rushed and kept complaining on the phone and to herself very loudly. i felt very uncomfortable leaving. she was also kind of rude and kept pushing her coworker to get off the phone when she was in the middle of helping someone on the phone. maryland was very unprofessional for no reason."
1-star,0,"bad customer service at jc penney's customer hotline. alorie is rude and nasty. she argues with callers as if she is on the streets fighting. she is very argumentative and will never give you a chance to speak. attention jc penney management: if you want to keep paying customers, get rid of this one."
1-star,0,"this review is for the poor management of the portrait studio; we made an appointment but we still had to wait 2 hours. it was the only day our family could all get together otherwise we would've left. from them deleting poses of my baby & ordering the wrong photos, this was by far the worst photography experience of my life. we had to return for reshoots & had to come back twice more to pick up the corrected items. mind you it's a 30 minute drive one way from our home. our only compensation was a free session & print coupon for our next trip. what makes them think we want to go back?"
4-star,1,"good customer service, decent selections, and plenty of parking. the mall is not as popular as it once was for shopping, but this jc penny is the few that is not closing. there is a lot of heavily discounted items in every department. from women's apparel, menswear, home decor, and jewelry. some parts of the store looks dated and other spots look ok, bit everything was well organized and clean. i think you can tell they are trying to see what works. they have a nice makeup section too, but i was looking for some t-shirts and blouses, which i did find and all at a very reasonable price. i would go back even though it is a little bit out of my way because sometimes i just don't want to wait for shipping and i actually want to see the material in person instead of a description. would recommend."
4-star,1,after moving into a new apartment we needed a few things. stopped in here to pick them up and were very happy with our experience. nice looking store inside and out. friendly staff. will definitely visit here again.
5-star,1,"i love this jc penney!! this location is so clean!! if you are looking for a clean store with great prices, this is your place. i really like this jc penney because it sits off by itself and isn't tied to an indoor mall. staff is friendly and eager to help everytime we are here. clothing is reasonably priced and won't fall apart on you. i really like there selection of workout wear and t-shirts. again, affordable t-shirts and they offer a nice variety of colors and sizes. if you go to jc penney online you can you can usually download coupons. you can either print or show your cell phone with a bar code for instant savings. bonus in my book! ;) i definitely recommend this store. enjoy!! :)"
5-star,1,"i had my daughter's first pictures taken here who is 8 months old. it was better than i expected. i sometimes have a hard time getting pictures of her smiling, but the photographer had no problem at all! the most important thing is that they have people scheduled every 15 min this holiday season and they are booked, so arrive early to check in. if you are late you will have to wait for a next opening. they showed me my options on things i could do and order but were not pushy at all! i definitely will be coming back next year for more :)"
5-star,1,"i had the best shopping experience yesterdsy. not only was penney's having great sales and clearance discounts, they have an additional 20 percent discount to jc penney credit card holders, and an additional 15 percent to brand new card holders for 24 hours. i explained to donna, the customer service agent, that i wanted to purchase 2 items available online and she ordered them for me shipped to this store location to receive free shipping and obtain the entire 35 percent discount. she went above and beyond customer service by definition and am so thankful for her service, thinking outside the box and truly caring. i then brought my mom that evening and we used the 35 percent discount and received another $10.00 discount based on the days purchases! what a great shopping experience - i will be back! thank you donna!"
5-star,1,i love this location! it is close to my house and very convenient. the store is huge and the layout is great. the staff is very friendly and helpful. this is the cleanest jcpenney i have ever been in. there are great selections for your whole family. be sure to keep your eye out for clearance as there are some terrific bargains to be had. kudos to staff and management for making it a truly great shopping experience. i will be back for sure.
5-star,1,awesome shopping experience! their alfred dunner collection is extensive and well-priced to clear spring/summer inventory. found several great items for traveling and dinner time choices. a special thank you to my very helpful daughter and donna at this store for assuring my bill was the lowest it could be! what a delightful young lady donna is.
1-star,0,"if i could give less than 1 star i would. just went to pick some new clothes up for my kids after our online order got cancelled and we were not notified. at the register we encountered the most rude, miserable, unprofessional person i have ever seen. im assuming she was a supervisor and she was hispanic. she treated us as if we were not paying customers and as if we were beneath her. she not only treated us this way but the remaining customers in line this way. she should be fired! i will never visit this jcpenny again and i would advise them to remove that miserable person from interacting with any customers. will not be returning to this location!"
1-star,0,"this is a review strictly for sephora. i always shop at town square sephora or the ones on the strip but i received a gift-card that could only be used at this location. i called in advance one day asking to come in and get my makeup done. (if you spend $50 they do your makeup at sephora.) they said they couldn't because there was only two of them in the store. uh ok? so i called a saturday and they said they couldn't because ""they were hosting an event"". i decided to go in anyways because i need foundation. upon arrival i saw two cashiers talking to a woman at the checkout. neither greeted me. after wandering aimlessly around the store & not receiving any help i made my way to the cashier she asked ""are you ready?"" again without greeting me or asking if i found everything ok i asked her for help and asked if the sephora line made a lipliner. she walked me over to the section and said ""uhh i guess we don't have it in this fixture."" & she did not suggest a different line like most good sales associates would do. they are not friendly and they are not knowledgeable of the products. then when we went back to check out she forgot to mention i had points and could get a free gift. i had to remind her. also no one told me anything having to do with their ""so called event."" i will never return here, i'll stick with the more professional sephoras."
1-star,0,"christmas shopping at this location over the past couple weeks and wow has customer service here gone downhill quick. i've spend hundreds here over the past few weeks. i'll break down my two recent experiences. first attempted to go to the salon and get a haircut. simple enough and something i have done here many times. i arrive up to the counter to check in. there were two customers getting haircuts and approximately 3 stylists standing around talking not really doing anything. barely got any kind of acknowledgement or even a hello. advised i'd like to get a haircut. they all had a look on their face that it would be a bother to try to cut my hair (especially the lady with purple/pink hairdo she is downright rude). every one of the stylists with me standing right there all start going back and forth with each other making excuses why they shouldn't have to help me. ""i can't do it have her do it."" well i'm not going to do it have this person do it"" and so on you get the idea. makes you feel welcomed wouldn't it? finally i just say forgot and sorry to bother everyone. the visit after this i was buying nearly $300 worth of jewelry. long story short they were dishonest and sold a ring i was supposed to pickup that i had on hold for 2 days. then tried to tell me the display case one was the same one same size and i believed it and bought it. soon realized the damn ring is two sizes smaller than the one i reserved for pickup. they were completely dishonest and didn't honor their word and resold the ring. in fact the day i show up to pick up the ring nobody has any clue what i'm talking about. this was after waiting to be helped a jewelry counter for 30 minutes to be assisted. they had one person to work jewelry in the middle of christmas shopping season. she did the best she could but helped people that were there after me which was frustrating."
5-star,1,"this is the jcpenney i usually go too because it's within my neighborhood. marissa is always very accommodating and helpful. she welcomes us with a smile and recalls us every time we come it. she provides great customer service and allows me to use my coupons when i make qualifying purchases. checkout process with marissa is always a breeze, she makes things easy. michael and erlinda are two other associates who knows what they're doing. they are very nice and helpful as well."
5-star,1,"this is a great store, i'm surprised i haven't been coming here more often. the store is very clean and they associates there are very friendly. they have a great selection for girls clothing and their prices are some of the most affordable that i've seen without sacrificing quality. i had a great experience with an associate by the name of marilyn that told me about the rewards program and was just an overall friendly person. i have no complaints about this store. the portrait studio at this location is also great. my daughters pictures came out really nice and it was easy to locate a coupon. the fact that they also have a sephora there is even more of a bonus."
1-star,0,"exceptionally rude and rushed. christy is the manager. confrontational- threatening and did not stand behind what i was told. basically called me a liar. would not reach out to the employee who just the day before told me one shirt change would be ok. christ kept "" putting in her last rude comments and then threatened not to allow us to stay for our session if we said anything"". i asked to have another photographer and she told me "" she ran things here not me"" i had been coming here for years. i will never return."
3-star,0,i'm not a bit penneys shopper but there's a sephora inside and i do love sephora! the store itself was bright and well merchandised and if i hadn't just dropped bank at sephora i would have stopped in the jewelery section because there were a few things that caught my eye.
1-star,0,"this store change to the worse, two years ago they have better quality clothes and the price was better. even the customer service is terrible, they chose who they attend too."
4-star,1,"holy shit! when did jc penney become cool? i couldnt believe their selection. yea, they aren't macy's or dillards, or whatever, but they have some cool ass shit. did you know they sell sephora. now, i dont use their products, but i know they are good. (ok, i've heard they are good). levi's, liz claiborne, dickies (to name just a few) of the name brands that they sell. i couldn't believe it. seriously, i was shocked. it was close to closing time and i didn't have time to look around but that's gonna change! next time i'm in a shopping mood (it happens monthly, hehe) this is gonna be the place i check out first. customer service was excellent. machelle (yes, that's how she spelled it), was fantastic. pretty much escorted me around trying to find a work shirt. oh, and 25% off everything in the store that day....boo yea! me likes alot! open an account and you get 20% off. i can't wait to get my shop on here!"
3-star,0,"i'm disappointed. we were looking to get a watch battery replaced and went to the jewelry section to ask for help. one lady was legitimately helping a customer, but couldn't take two seconds out to let us know that she'll be with us. so we moved to the other kiosk where there were two sales representatives helping one lady. surely they could have taken some time out to assist me? nope. the dynamic duo refused to even look my direction as i waited at the counter patiently for five minutes for someone to at least speak to me. five. minutes. i finally had it and went to sears grand where people at least responded to you. great quality clothing, but some of the sales representatives obviously need a lot of work in the training department."
5-star,1,"years and years ago i had a hairstylist at a very chic and trendy salon here in town. i went to her for a couple years. i only saw her once every other month, sometimes a bit longer. each time i noticed she was making some noticeable ""lifestyle"" changes. nothing major...when i first met her she was married with a child. she divorced, started dressing younger and she would tell me about all the partying she was doing. typical divorcee stuff, no biggie. on what would be my last appointment, i noticed she was really different...she was completely strung out and totally out of it. resting herself on my head at various times throughout my appointment. dropping her tools. asking me if the pictures in the salon were crooked. another customer was telling a story about how a coworker had given her a pill for her headache and how she ended up in the emergency room later that night...turns out the coworker had given her an oxycontin. upon hearing this story, my stylist went to that customer and asked her if she had anymore. it was awkward and scary. i silently said a prayer for her not to ruin my hair. or to cut me. and i never went back. i was in limbo for a long time...one day while shopping at this jc penny, i thought i really need a haircut, so, in i went. it was a good move! my stylist and i hit it off and i was super happy with the results. after a year or two, my stylist moved to a different state. but she recommended another stylist at the salon. shahla. let me tell you about shahla. she's amazing. people compliment my hair every single day. she's like the hair whisperer. she knows what will look best and exactly how to make it happen. listen to her! she knows what she is doing! her coloring technique is top notch. her cuts are perfection. i couldn't imagine not going to her. my hair is the best it's ever looked. and she tells you the truth...if i bring a photo in of what i want my hair to look like, she'll tell me how much work it will take to maintain it, like how often i'll have to come in for touch ups or how hard it might be to style it at home. and she'll also tell you if your hair just won't do that. there's nothing worse than a stylist who tries to give you a style that does not work with your hair type. one thing is for sure: i will follow shahla wherever she goes...she is the best!"
5-star,1,very nice jcpenney's. great selection of clothing for big guys. the store was clean and every employee i encountered was friendly and offered assistance. highly recommend!
5-star,1,"i have been going to the salon for the last 5 years! my hair girl, shalah is the best! when i say best, i mean it! she always steers me right on my hair! i have never had a bad cut or color from her! she is fabulous! if you want someone who can help you get the best out of your hair, shalah is your lady! plus, she is always on time! :) can't say enough about how much i love her!!!! :)"
5-star,1,"it took me a long time to get my husband to shop here instead of casual male xl. it's way more inexpensive, they always have sales, and the big and tall men's section is superb! not to wild about the women's/misses clothing, but they have the cuuuutest shoes!"
1-star,0,"i really wish yelp allowed to give a negative star rather than one. one star just seems way too generous, in my opinion. this review is for the salon located at j.c.penney. from appointment to final cut, my experience was horrible. i would have preferred hand my bulldog a pair of scissors and let her go to town on my head. first off, the girl that scheduled my appointment and my sister's appointment scheduled us for an hour and a half apart. i didn't agree to that, but whatever, a woman was there on her day off and they asked her to clock in. unfortunately, she wouldn't stop remarking about how she generously clocked in. we each brought photos in for how our hair should be cut. mine's not bad, but my sister hates her hair, the woman spent more time diagnosing her dry scalp than actually paying attention to my sister's reference material. i walked out of there with such an intense headache from the spots where my gal had burned my scalp with the blow dryer. i was never trained as a cosmetologist or an aesthetician, but isn't it common knowledge that you don't hold a blow dryer in the same spot for an extended amount of time?! after i told her about it, she apologized but then remarked that it was easier to just get the root dried first. does somebody have the number for tabatha? i'm done, apparently j.c.penney salons are now the skill equivelent to super cuts with more money tacked on at the end. yeah, i'm angry that i could have paid $14.00 and gotten a crappy cut somewhere else."
4-star,1,"i went here today and found cargo shorts like i was looking for. the store didn't have very many shoppers and it was easy to look for what i wanted, find that indeed they did have what i wanted, try it on, and then check out all within 15 minutes of entering the store. since there were so few shoppers, parking was a breeze and i was near the one entrance. the store is undergoing some renovation. there are several areas blocked off with plastic walls and they're doing work inside. i'll have to come back and see the improvements. i've been to this jcp before and it's very convenient to where i live. i'll be back."
4-star,1,"awesome customer service. i had to return a few items and one didn't have a tag (it must have broken off or something). i did have the receipt and there were absolutely no issues about getting a refund, etc."
5-star,1,"i've been shopping at penney's forever! i grew up on the catalogs and enjoyed shopping with my mom as a child. we could always relied on quality. now the concept of a free standing store isn't new, it's recent return is the best idea they have had in a long time. i like parking just outside the door, walking in and shopping, then when i am done, walk out to my car and move on to the next shop on my list, or head home. i don't like walking malls, and putting up with crowds. i don't think i have seen the store really busy, during the holidays, and weekends, i have seen a little bit more than usual crowds, but lines aren't long at check out. i have found some really good gift ideas, and since they have big and talls, found some things for my really big and tall father! love jcp!"
5-star,1,"this review is for the hair salon. i've been coming here for quite some time now. i first met janelle at hair experts and followed her here. after a few years of getting my haircut from her, she moved, and i was introduced to shahla. shahla is wonderful! i've gone to many hair salons but never this satisfied. i never complained about my haircut. she spends her time with me and my daughter. my daughter is very pleased with the way she cuts and styles her hair. shampoo, cut, and style are all included with the price."
3-star,0,"hanging a ""customer service"" sign over the cash registers does not magically transform your cashiers into a customer service department. so imagine my dismay when i went to ""customer service"" to inquire about fitting rooms because i couldn't find any sales associates on the floor and still had to wait for 2 groups before me to checkout."
1-star,0,"why does a transaction take seven full minutes? i'm buying boxed jewelry -- i'm not applying for a mortgage. i've visited this jcp several times over the last few years when i needed to buy some gifts or necessities. every time, i've waited a good five minutes in line and another at least five minutes waiting for the cashier to ring up my purchase. i've also filled out the jcp survey (from the receipt) every time and described the incredibly slow experience. when i have to go into this jcp, i intentionally rush my shopping and searching because i assume i'll be spending the majority of my time in the store standing at the checkout."
5-star,1,this is probably the best jcpenney in madison. great help from tracy and heather tonight from jewelry department. they have a lot of great products!
4-star,1,"i've read about how poorly penney's is doing, and i hope they can get it together because i like this place. i really like their exercise wear (i found these fantastic running bras for less than $20!!) and they seem to always have lots of stuff marked down. they also have, at least in the women's section, quite a few dressing rooms, which i love. i discovered their ship-to-store option and am a fan. you find your items on the website (there are reviews for most things, also appreciated), order and pay for them, and have them sent to the penney's of your choice. if you get more than $25 of merchandise they ship to the store for free. you waltz in to any register and give them your info (you need your phone number and the credit card you used, if i remember right), then they get on the walkie-talkie and have somebody bring your bag/box to the register. i recommend not going during a super-busy time if possible, but otherwise it didn't take long at all."
5-star,1,"have any of you been to jcpenney recently? wow! it's on the up! first of all, the new pricing policy is great. three tiers: 1) standard price, 2) month-long specials, 3)markdowns straight to ""best price"" - so if you see something with the red tag you know that it's the lowest it'll be. and, wow, they are going low. i got my little cousin 5 shirts, 1 skort, and a pair of jeans for $17 2 weeks ago for her birthday. yes, kids clothes are cheaper than adult clothes in general, but this was just a steal. last night i found a pair of m-n-g (mango) jeans for $5. five dollars! and they're doing a total remodel of the store and have already installed a really fashion-forward jeans department featuring levi's products (which, sadly, have never worked for me - but it's still a well designed department) and a really wonderful, if a bit small, shoe department. fashion-wise, having lived in europe for 3 years i can say with confidence that the m-n-g line that mango is doing for penney's is sometimes even better than the stuff in their standard stores in the uk and europe (i kept noticing this on trips to the us). they've also got other designer collaborations and seem to be trying to compete with the fashion-forward nature of target, etc. while keeping hold on the more traditional department store branding as well. since moving back to the us in the spring, i've been shopping more at penney's that i had in probably the 5 years before i left. this location and the west towne location are really making great strides."
2-star,0,"two stars for excellent pricing on eyewear and a pretty good selection. no real 'names' so if you're looking for coach sunglasses, move along. i needed new glasses, so prescription in hand i went shopping for frames. actually, i found jcp optical by accident, didn't know they even had an optical center. found a great pair of frames and a great price, handed over my rx and completed the order. simple, huh? not quite. it took three tries and four weeks to get my eyeglasses. apparently, their glasses are made in new jersey by blind elves who lack the ability to grind glass using sophisticated machinery. many phone calls and much ado ensues, finally i receive my glasses no less than 30 days from the date of order. that was frustrating, but to their credit, they gave me half off the final price."
5-star,1,"i recently went to the sephora inside this jcpenney and candace here was such a great help. she not only made the return process easy (i bought a nars foundation that i ended up hating) but she also got out of the register to help match me and grab a sample of a new foundation, mind you there was only 2 employees working that sephora and a lot of customers! she was very professional, listened to me rant hehe, and was very helpful! would highly recommend coming here again!"
1-star,0,"i don't even want to give this jcp store in goodyear, az 1 star!! it is by far the worst looking jcp store i've ever been in. my husband worked for the company for 38 years & we retired in az. the goodyear store is the closest to us. i used shop in jcp all of the time, no more!i've been in lots of jcp stores, as we've moved 6 times & my husband used to be a secret shopper in the stores. it doesn't seem like this store is ever recovered at all, what does this store manager do?!! he certainly doesn't manage his store or motivate his people to make this store look the way it should. i'll shop at kohls, i don't like it as much, but at least it's neat looking whenever i go in."
1-star,0,what happened to penny's of the past?? this place is now an absolute dump! my wife and i went into jcp about a week ago looking for blouses for her; you would have thought a tornado hit this place. this place is as bad as kmart or even worst. i don't know what their strategy is but it's not working. i think if they keep this up the writing is going to be on the wall for an already struggling jcp. will go to kohls instead. good luck jcp.
1-star,0,this store is by far the messiest i have ever seen it! i can't even stand to shop there anymore! went in today. no more! clean it up or or hire someone who can! this is awful!
5-star,1,this is the best salon in goodyear. all of the stylists are friendly. i love getting my highlights there. great atmosphere.
1-star,0,what's the point of giving us coupons that we can't use. i went to jcpenney today just to be told that here's $10 but you can't use it on anything.
1-star,0,this store is a complete disaster. the jean tables are completely destroyed you can't find sizes or styles. there are table and displays with piles and piles of shirts with no rhyme or reason. you can tell what's on sale and what's not. i used to shop here all the time and was always satisfied but i don't think i'll come back. one of the most disorganized stores i have ever been into. i will take ross anyway over this store. they need to take some pride in their store.
5-star,1,"we finally purchased our washer and dryer from the jcpenney appliances department. our sales clerk was great, very helpful. we even signed up for the jcpenney card to save even more money. i have always liked jcpenney. we will continue to recommend and shop with jcpenney. the installation and delivery company that they use is awesome too."
1-star,0,the messiest jcpenny store i have ever been to. i expect the clearance section to be a little messy. but the entire store has just shelves with piles of clothes rolled up into balls and clothes thrown everywhere. we were so annoyed and didn't feel like digging through stuff to find anything so we left.
1-star,0,"i just have to say, i'm so disappointed in how this store looked. i know it's the day before mother's day but there's no reason walkways should be blocked with boxes, open boxes of toys and trash?! not to mention piles of clothes on the floor around every corner. i worked here in 2013 and my manager then would never let it get that bad. i didn't even buy anything, it was too difficult to find what you were looking for."
1-star,0,"i've always had a good experience with jc penney salons but not this one! the stylist was late, did not listen to what color i wanted for my highlights & did her own thing. it took her 4 hours to do my hair & i walked out with basically the same hair color that i walked in with. i got married the next day and was very sad & disappointed with how my hair turned out. horrible experience! i will not go back!"
1-star,0,i was at the store last week. walked around and waited fir a rep to help me out. 1 was busy with a client and the other young hispanic girl was pretending she was busy but she was actually flirting with an off shift coworker. every time i went by her she would start arranging products and acting as she was looking for something in particular. i was watching her. she then would start talking to the guy but he was not really paying too much attention to her. bad customer service. i was very disappointed. sephora is supposed to be a high class high quality store but hire lazy mediocre staff.
1-star,0,"we purchased several appliances from the appliance department through the very nice and very helpful aaron. i would recommend him highly. i am actually reviewing their delivery service and the installer jorge who has no understanding of the concept of politeness. we paid an extra 90 dollars for delivery and installation with the understanding that the installer could work with any situation, including a new kitchen. jorge refused to do any work today because he did not like the way our kitchen vent was configured even though it was correctly and professionally installed. he actually tried to take our merchandise back. my husband then called irene, his boss and also got little sympathy. we now are in possession of appliances that are not hooked up, even though they could be, just because jorge went on a power trip and irene gave him the fuel to do it. we were going to purchase a new refrigerator from penney's this week because we were so happy with aaron (our salesman's) service. now thanks to jorge and irene we will be looking elsewhere. no wonder jc penney's is going the way of countless other failed retailers."
4-star,1,this jcpenny is not too different on the outside or interior at first glance but one you take a good look at it its like an different story what perticularly interested me was that it had a different setup than most other places that ive seen also it has a few things that other stores have so it deserves a four star rating.
1-star,0,"you can't even walk into this place, it's so dirty and things are thrown all over the place. when i overheard an associate talk to another associate about the store they said well it's a never ending battle and why clean up. totally not the attitude to have about the place you work. i guess i'll have to drive to arrowhead when it's a little more upscale then walking into this dirty place, i feel walmart is probably cleaner then this place."
5-star,1,i was in earlier in the day and it was absolutely nuts so i places some items on hold. looked at the website for some coupons and found a sweater. called the store to see if they had any in stock. can't remember whom i spoke with. but she said she would hold both color options at the east register. went back now and they couldn't find it anywhere. i very nice cashier walked me through the store and came up empty. i wish i would have gotten her name. we found similar items someone placed on hold with out a name but it wasn't what i was looking for. but she was super nice! we found a associate named madeline and after her searching for almost 20 mins she found my items! they weren't even on the floor and she still found them. i am so happy!
1-star,0,prepare for checkout lines worse than disneyland. some people start waiting in line as soon as they arrive to reserve a spot while family members shop and then join them in line. rediculously long lines means it will be a long time before i try this store again
1-star,0,as soon as you walk in this store the stinch begins! this store is super dirty and the shoe department is s joke! the place is turned upside-down and needs seriously cleaning. the employees act like zombies no one knows nothing. jcpenny has no internet service in store and the wi-fi is also a sad joke! never going back.
4-star,1,"this is a nice, clean jcpenney. the employees here are friendly and helpful. i like that this location isn't in a big shopping mall - it's in a strip mall."
5-star,1,pretty stress free experience at penny's. went with my husband and toddler looking for some new clothes for the two of them. great prices and the cashier gave us an additional 15% off after helping me locate a coupon online with my phone. will definitely be back to do some shopping for myself later.
5-star,1,"writing this review for salon services. i went in two weeks ago to fix a lightening session i had done twice at a different jcp location. i was assigned to carmen. let's just say she knows what she is doing! i wanted a balayage done. the previous stylist messed the whole thing up but carmen fixed my hair! i am thankful that my hair was left with little damaged done because of her! she is nice, patient and understanding. i'd definitely recommend her if you want to go lighter/ombré/balayage!"
3-star,0,the system needs change. jcp in my opinion changed to mirror kohls. i had to order two items as they did not have the selection of sizes available in boys clothing. i ordered them but had to pick up in store for free shipping. when i picked up the items i had to wait 20 minutes due to their service desk had not enough sales reps. they allowed the customers who were returning items to go look for another item while they kept the register on hold. poor system.
4-star,1,"it has been a while but i'm back now. i use to shop at jc penny often but stopped when the sales started decreasing. i'm happy to say the sales are back and so am i. i thoroughly enjoy the shopping process (both offline and online) at jcpenney. the in-store customer service reps are incredibly helpful, and i find the online shopping experience easy to navigate and i usually find exactly what i am looking for. it's not always easy to find a retail experience online that makes you feel confident and secure with uour purchases as jcpenney's does. if you haven't been to jc penny in a while i would recommend you visit the stire or online."
5-star,1,"the salon here is amazing- ask for quinton!!! he turned my dead yellow knotted terrible hair into what i wanted but even better and made it healthy and took so much care time and effort to invest in making it perfect... i've never been into a salon and got what i was hoping for, but i walked out and felt amazing and got even better than what i thought could be done with my hair- freaking love it and i freaking love quinton!"
4-star,1,being bigger muscled guy i need a big and tall section and they do have one but be prepared to be limited with selection. they have bigger items that fit in the shoulders but unfortunately they seem to all be sold in tall as well as big. i was able to find a xxxl sweater that was not to long though and it was a good price.
4-star,1,yay! sephora is finally here!! this is the only reason i decided to return to jcpenney. i was pleasantly surprised that things have once again been changed to include sales. in fact it seems that the whole store seemed back to normal with sales and clearance. i may actually start shopping here again.
2-star,0,"they do have some really cute stuff, but this whole new pricing thing...it blows. things were so much more less expensive before... however, if they'd follow suit with other jcp's and add a sephora...i'd be there weekly!"
2-star,0,holy after-christmas madness. kohl's puts this low end department store to shame. i found nothing i liked. don't go here unless you're paid in cash every other friday and have a family of 7.
5-star,1,we're out of state from colorado my boyfriend wanted to buy a suit in vegas looked him up on line went inside and the atmosphere was purely amazing helped us right away we actually ended up leaving with 4 suits! he's such a nice man very funny homey would recommend this place to anyone in vegas 100%!
5-star,1,"this afternoon i walked into jacobi's to see if anything grabbed my attention to spruce up my work suit collection. i was immediately greeted by the owner himself. he was able to help me and work the entire store to make sure all of it questions were answered. he could tell my size by looking at me and he explained the suit special. i was very impressed with the selection, quality, and service. i used their tailor, who is as sweet of a person as they come. i walked out knowing i got a great deal, thank you sir! highly recommend!"
1-star,0,"i went to jacobi's last week to buy some new suits for my new job. from the start i told jacobi i didn't want the $299 special, i was willing to pay $499 for the wool suits since i didn't want polyester. i ended up buying 4 suits for $670 (with the 4 shirts, 4 ties, 4 socks, and 1 belt). imagine my surprise today after i picked up my suits and got them home to see there's not 1% wool in any of the 4 suits. all 4 are 65% poly 35% rayon. not only did jacobi sell me the special i specifically told him i didn't want (the poly blend) he then charged me the wool suit price! buyer beware"
5-star,1,jacobi is really friendly and helpful. he didn't push any suits on me or push to upsale on more expensive suits. one of the deals is 3 really great quality suits with a shirt/tie/socks for each suit for $500.00. one of the suits cost $900.00 elsewhere. another deal was 3 suits for $300.00 including a shirt/tie/socks for each. hands down this is the best place to find a top tier quality suit for a low price and excellent customer service.
5-star,1,"i needed a suit and i was leaving vegas the following day. i googled suits in vegas and found this perfect spot. they got me exactly what i wanted and were able to tailor the same day. alice was personable, professional, and efficient. i highly recommend this store."
5-star,1,"my favorite place to shop when in las vegas!!! not only is the quality great, but the staff is amazing and their prices are fantastic!! i have nearly my entire wardrobe replaced with jacobi's apparel. my wife loves the 'new me'!! don't waste your time at any other men's clothing store!"
5-star,1,"stumbled upon jacobi's men's fashions on google and it was the best thing that could have happened to us this week. upon entering the store jacobi himself was of great help in answering our questions and is very knowledgeable about sizes and fashion. initially we went in looking for a suit for my father in law, whom past away just yesterday monday the 26th, and my mother in law had a specific style, color and look she wanted to last see him in. we found it! he had a great selection. jacobi was such a sweetheart and gave us a great deal for 3 suits, shirts and ties for my father in law (rest his soul), my husband and brother in law. he doesn't realize how much help this truly was to our family in this time of suffering, but we will forever be grateful and loyal customers. jacobi has a wonderful personality and was a pleasure to talk to. god bless him."
5-star,1,jacobi's is by far the best place to buy suits. jacob is not only professional with a keen eye for quality and taste in his products but his pricing is outstanding. it is very enjoyable to shop with him to fit you perfectly in the suit/suits and everything that completes the look. great store very highly recommended. tell jacob erin sent you!!!!
5-star,1,"what an awesome place to go for men's clothing. went in looking for a suit for a special occasion and was in an out in 20 minutes. picked out a great suit, dress shirt, and two ties. alterations were done perfectly and on time. jacobi was awesome!"
5-star,1,"omg!!! i walked in the store with my husband looking for a hat and end up buying some amazing suites, shoes and matching shirts. real nice quality material. jacobi helped us and his customer service is impeccable!! don't waste your time at the mall. must go to jacobi first!!"
5-star,1,jacobi's is awesome thank you so much alice for the great and wonderful job you did i cannot believe it is you're like the gordon ramsay fitting everybody and anybody that needs a suit this is a must go place your time not wasted they can look you and measure up right away they're all professionals i recommend the 3 socks 3 shirts 3 jackets 3 pants one belt for $499 which i purchased. i took my son down there i took two suits he got one. awesome awesome awesome. they will not waste your time there i've been to other places they try on so many different suits and stuff they didn't know what they're doing. jacobis knows what they're doing please please go down there doesn't take much time if your father have two sons each get a suit 3 friends get a suit you can't beat the quality and price again alice you are awesome thank you for the great service
5-star,1,"after visiting the typical chain stores and not being able to find a suit that fits my broad shoulders (gym for 15 years), i was ready to go to a tailored place knowing i was probably going to pay $800 to $1000 for one tailored suit, but decided to stop by jacobi's on a whim. i'm more than happy that i stopped by jacobi's to take advantage of his 3 suits, 3 ties, 3 dress shirts, 3 handkerchiefs, 1 belt special for $500. more importantly, i was able to find suits that fit properly. jacobi was there to offer great service and years of experience in this industry. as the owner of the store, it's going to be hard to beat his level of customer service. he was able to find great combinations of shirts & ties to match the suits, saving me time. no need to shop around going forward as this place has my business for life! i just wish i found this shop earlier in life. jacobi was very kind in giving a birthday present to my son, who sacrificed a couple of hours for me, which probably felt like 5 hours to a 10 year old since it wasn't a toy store. jacobi, i already have referrals going your way. thank you for a great experience at your store, and needless to say, i'll be stopping by in the future."
5-star,1,"not my first time at this store but didn't have a chance to write a review before. this is the perfect place to shop for men and women. came to shop for my boyfriend and i'm happy! service is always great and friendly. prices are better than anywhere in town and you're getting quality clothes. i love this place, all in one store :)"
5-star,1,the staff was amazing & very courteous. alice took care of 5 suits with different fittings like a pro. i can truly say they take pride in what they do. they make us feel like family. i know for a fact we will look very sharp for my wedding coming up in january. i'd recommend jacobi's to anyone & for any occasion. thanks so much for your amazing hospitality!
5-star,1,excellent customer service...mr. jacobi has more than 30yrs experience in the field and willing to teach you the fine art of looking good in a suit. pricing is reasonable if you are on a budget like me..
4-star,1,"we were in and out of here in 15 minutes with 3 suits for my husband with shirts, ties, belt, & shoes to match that fit him perfect! the lady was very helpful & knew what she was doing. she knew his size just by looking at him and when he tried everything on it fit perfect. she was great at picking colors to match his suits & i would go back."
5-star,1,"i'm an attorney so i have to wear a suit every day. i'd previously bought my suits from joseph a. banks and i looked like a schlub. i first came to jacobi's and hesitantly bought a couple suits and it was like night and day difference, excellent style and great prices. at church that sunday, my wife thought by butt looked good, i knew it was because of the suit. i came back in and bought 7 more suits the same style. i literally threw all my other suits away into the trash. i won't wear any of my old suits anymore."
5-star,1,"my first yelp review and i am going to use it on jacobi's. you will receive the ultimate in excellent customer service at the store. i walked in needing to purchase three suits. jacobi walked me through the store and spent the time needed. while i was looking at a higher price point, jacobi actually directed me to a lower priced line that looked on me. oh yeah, forgot to mention that you get 3 ties, 3 shirts, 3 pairs of socks and a belt with the 3 suit special. result? 6 suits purchased. thank you!"
5-star,1,"i needed a suit for a meeting and got three suits, shirts, ties, socks, and a belt for what i was going to pay for one suit at the hugo boss outlet store. they have in-store alterations, and jacobi has a real eye for style and fit. couldn't be happier, and i will be back."
5-star,1,"i shopped around for cheap yet good quality suits and this place us def the spot! stopped in to get my man a couple suits. alice immediately greeted us and started helping us gather suits in his size and choice of colors. alice quickly started putting together different shirts and ties that looked nice with my man's chosen suits. we were given a couple of great options in which it was hard to chose as they all looked amazing together. alice then added a belt and 3 pairs of socks. as he was being measured by the seamstress, i went to pay using a yelp check in discount offer. i am shocked how quick it was shopping for suits. great customer service and my man is lookin like a million bucks this place is our new one stop shop for suits. & did i mention they were super friendly and great with my 2 year old son. thanks for the great experience"
5-star,1,best customer service ! ive never had to wear a suit before and jacobi was very knowledgeable and made the experience fun ! thanks jacobi for the beautiful suits !
5-star,1,amazing customer service! i am new with getting suits and jacobis made it easy and very affordable! i recommend this place to anyone who needs to get a suit! they even have nice watches and other clothing options so i will be back! great selection!
5-star,1,"this place is amazing! :) we have our own wedding coming up and then my fiancé was requested to be in a wedding. when we went, we had already rented a tux from another place.. however when we got there, it turns out it cost less to buy the tux than rent it! the suits and tuxes were much nicer than the rentals, so i'd highly recommend it!! plus, jacobi is amazing and ara the tailor is great! go now. !"
4-star,1,"went to jacobi's couture to pick up a suit for an interview. when i arrived jacobi himself was there, he showed me some great suits. i bought 3 suits which included 3 shirts, 3 ties, 3 handkerchiefs, 3 pairs of socks, and a belt for a great price! i told the tailor that operates in the back of the store that i needed the suits in a week. i went in 6 days later hoping that the suits would be finished and i could try them on for any final touch ups, unfortunately they were not. i went in the next morning and the suits fit perfectly. the tailor only takes cash and the prices were a little steep but was good overall. if the tailor would accept credit cards and was a little more affordable i would give 5 stars. the clothes are great and i will be going back very soon. thanks jacobi!"
5-star,1,my boyfriend has been all over town looking for suits but not wanting to pay an arm and a leg for them . we went to jacobi's and he got five great suits for less than 800.00 . besides having a great variety in mens suits the customer service is top notch . i don't say this often because nowadays were lucky to get decent service when we go anywhere . the staff is knowledgeable and more than happy to help you find what you need a price range you're comfortable with . i would highly recommend going to jacobi's to anyone that reads this review . best in vegas !!!
1-star,0,"omg, i really dont know how these guys are still in business. i bought a suit there (jacket, pants, vest, shirt and tie) and the shirt buttons started falling off not to mention the threads sticking out of every seam. its all made in china with cheesy italian name labels (giovanis, fellinis, raviolis and fetuchinis). my pants had clip zips on the sides, it broke two weeks after. i couldn't wear them anymore and took it back. the attitude i got was so ugly (we already got your money and you are bugging us now). the lady there made me feel like i came to exchange a new lamborghini. she had to call the owner and the manufacture and refused to replace it. she said she had to exchange it with the manufacture and call me in a few days. it was so obvious she was just blowing me off and didnt do a thing about it. i called two weeks after and her comical reply was ""still waiting for ups. try tomorrow"". wtf. it takes less time to ship a car from the other side of the world. do they really think people are that stupid?! these guys have no clue what customer service is. a simple exchange for a defected item that cost them maybe 5% of what they sell it for and you get an attitude like you, the customer, are in the wrong. they can keep the pants. i'm not gonna even waste my time with them anymore. but i'll be sure to tell everyone and anyone i know to stay away from that place."
4-star,1,"on the hunt for what seemed like an impossible to find suit for our wedding, alas, we found it at jacobi! my husband is not a tiny man, and the size he was looking for is not really common... plus he wanted to get married in an ivory (not common) color to top it off (but not too ivory that it looks yellow or cream but almost white)... mission impossible? not at jacobi's. sure, they only had one or two styles, and their shirts were a bit cheap, and their tie styles/colors a bit funky and reminded me of something borat would wear, but who cares, we found his suit... and got two different suit colors because there was a buy-two deal! we upgraded from the cheapest buy-two deal so it wasn't the cheapest we could find, but it was the only place we were able to find what we were looking for with our odd uncommon requests. we were only in town for a few days so we needed to buy something off-the-rack and get it tailored before we left. the seamstress stayed after hours and jacobi was able to deliver before we left to travel back home however they hemmed the sleeves and pants a little too short. i told my husband ""i dont think you're supposed to expose your wrists or ankles that much"" but it was too late... the damage was done. and you couldn't really tell that much so we just had to deal with it. my advice is to hem it a bit longer than they recommend, because the lady will take too much off anyway. overall pleased with everything though because if it weren't for jacobi, we wouldn't be able to find our impossible-to-find suit anywhere else. trust us, we tried. minus one star for the too-short hem job and funky patterned selection of ties and shirts."
5-star,1,mr jacobi happenned to be at the shop the day we went in. he is a super cool guy and was extremely helpful with our selections. my friend picked out 5 suits that were bad ass for 1100 and that was with shirts and ties and everything! i have to say i would go back only if he was there. he's a total rockstar and love the owner!
1-star,0,"the staff at the downtown location tend to be rude. i walk in wearing their own higher end suits and am treating as if i am bothering them. i was considering using them for tux rental, but when they were unwilling to allow those who would be wearing the tux to simply get measured before the tux color was chosen that was it for me. i was told ""its too difficult to change colors in our system"". i decided to call the online store and they told me the store associate was wrong and that they could definitely get me set-up for the tux and i could call back with colors. it was too late and we decided to go to tuxedo junction. i have shopped at jos a banks locations for about 8 years now. the service has greatly decreased and is at the point where i don't have any interest in visiting a store; especially the downtown location. they rarely provide quality customer service. on another occasion i went it to get measured to send my measurement to my cousins suit retailer for his wedding. being a customer of the company i didn't think this was such a big ask. i was hurried over to a coat and that's all they would size. they would not get the tap measure out and seemed annoyed when i asked to try on a different size jacket in a different style."
2-star,0,"called the store to ask about sales event, salesman pretty much tried everything to not have me come in. store hours are incorrect on the website. it was fortunate i called in to confirm the hours, i guess. called the ross park location... much better experience. will be going there. the salesman seemed to actually want to help and earn my business."
1-star,0,"i called to inquire about a tux rental for my wedding and the person on the phone had awful customer service. he was rude, impatient, and apparently didn't want to make a sale. looks like i'm getting my tux rental elsewhere."
1-star,0,"terrible tuxedo rentals! i went here 2 months before my good friend's wedding to get sized and order my tuxedo. the salesman who measured me did not know what he was doing, continued to ask someone else if he was 'doing it right' and made me extremely uncomfortable. at the moment i wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt that he would get it right. when i picked it up, it did not fit!! they go through a third party and did not have an easy way to remedy the situation. they had to ship a replacement to where i was going since it was an out of town wedding. i had to return it to another jos. a bank store because i did not want to go back to the rpm location to see the guy that fit me originally. when i returned i wanted to see what they could do for my extreme amount of inconvenience and they hassled me when i wanted a refund! i was going to use them for my bridal party tuxedos next year, but no way now. all the employees there just said they go through a third party so its no wonder their rentals are not easier! ha! poor excuse for a gentleman's store. oh, and its very very expensive! however, jack from the rpm store was very kind and helped to make a bad situation better."
4-star,1,"my husband rick likes this store for his business wear and some of his sports wear. he likes that there are salespeople here who actually wait on him, fit him, and make recommendations. he also likes the dress shoes here. we bought his last suit here on sale. it was originally $550.00, on sale for $199.00. and i gotta tell ya, it fits him so well and looks so good on him! i love being seen with my guy when he's wearing that suit! i work pretty close to the downtown location, and since they're having a sale, he asked me to pick up a couple of dress shirts for him. the salesman there helped me pick out a couple of shirts that would go well with his suit. yes, jos. a. bank's is a little more expensive than many places. indeed, it is quite a bit more expensive than target or walmart. y'know what though? you get what you pay for, and my guy is one of those who'd rather pay a little more and get clothes that look good on him, especially for business. he's one of those guys who wants his clothes to be well made and to last."
4-star,1,"when the shoes for which i was looking weren't available at the christown journeys, the staff there located a pair at arrowhead. when i arrived, i found the shoes i wanted but realized they wouldn't work with the outfit i'd picked out. fortunately, there was another pair of doc martins available for an incredibly low-low price. the associate initially was looking at other locations to see if she could find my exact size (the remaining floor model ended up being only a little too big), but i insisted on getting the shoes there. she gave me a discount because the shoes were floor models, plus i had a coupon for $5 off. color me crazy for walking out with a new pair of docs for under $15. werd."
1-star,0,be careful. this place sells used shoes. unbelievable. i went in to get my little sister shoes for school. the lady brought out a pair that were scuffed on the sides and the front had a chunk missing from it. so i told the lady if they had another pair. she brought out another pair which were in better shape. you could tell they had been used as well though because there was a heel print inside both shoes. never will go back to this place.
5-star,1,husband found a great pair of new balance shoes and the customer service was great! the girl working there gabbed a lot of different styles and made the experience easy for us
5-star,1,"dani helped me out. she was super friendly and helpful. the store didn't have my exact size in a shoe that i wanted to purchase, so she gladly called around to multiple stores to find the right one for me. i appreciate the customer service at this location."
5-star,1,"i am so please with the level of customer assistance i received at journeys #917. a huge shout out to zoe, who assisted me and my little girl with sizing and fitting of a pair of white low cut converse shoes. zoe went the extra mile to recommend socks which were cheaper and more durable than name brand socks. zoe did not pressure for sales, she did however suggest we ""check out the in store sale items."" i only wish my shopping experience involved associates like zoe. i will be a return customer, thankyou zoe. willa smith of holbrook, az."
1-star,0,"awful customer service. i came up to the counter with a pair of shoes to exchange and both girls were lacing shoes, looked very annoyed that was bothering them and after an awkward silence one finally said ""hi"" without eye contact and an attitude. one of the girls was very vocal and made it obvious that they didn't have the pair of shoes i was looking for. however she approached this with ""nope. no. no we don't have those"" and walking away. the whole experience has made me want to never return to this store which is unfortunate because i love it normally."
1-star,0,"these guys charged more to sharpen my scissors, than i paid for them in the first place, which i pointed out when i went in to pay for the sharpening. they basically said ""too bad, that's what we charge"" the scissors are now worse than they were when i brought them in. terrible service and unfriendly staff! i don't see the point of going back, i strongly recommend that you find a better spot for your sharpening needs."
5-star,1,"kent of inglewood is a combination barber shop (complete with waxed mustaches on the stylists), men's grooming supplies shop, and a knife (including straight razor) shop. it's an uber macho/classy/cool place to walk around, my only regret being that it really was time for me to get a haircut. and an old-fashioned shave on top of that? why not? instead, i gravitated to the knives and spent a lot of time looking through it all. that included a neat collection of shaving blades, including a japanese model from knifewear across the street. the person at the counter mentioned that kent of inglewood offered lessons. i wasn't quite sure about that opportunity. i eventually found a cool little japanese fixed blade at a reasonable price, but still wondered what i left behind. i know that this was a great place because as i was leaving, i circled back 3 times to take another look. let's hope i get another chance to find my way back to calgary and end up here again. and with an open mind and gift list."
5-star,1,"bought myself a straight razor here, and the staff were extremely friendly and knowledgeable. they were willing to answer all my questions and were willing to teach this novice how to use a strop and the straight razor. i have had the razor for 6 months now and it has been great. if you are looking for a razor this is the place to go."
5-star,1,"a visit to inglewood is simply not complete without stopping in at kent of inglewood. i was first introduced to this shop through a yelp elite event and i've been a fan ever since. i somehow thought that shaving accoutrements were only relevant to fellas. well since trying out a yummy shaving souffle i can say i my stems have not had a closer shave in their life. the upside is being fair haired and minimally fuzzy i now shave even less often with the use of this lovely shaving souffle. at christmas it was hard to stick to my budget as i wanted to pick up nifty and yummy selling stuff for all the fellas in my life. the staff are friendly, incredibly knowledgeable and definitely no pressure on sales. they use the products themselves and can speak to their performance from first hand knowledge. i like that! they are fantastic members of their community as shown by their participation in the window decorations for the holidays. if i recall correctly they won the competition. they also put out a calendar for charity which was slightly racey and even more fun. love guys with moustaches and beards who have a great sense of humour. do yourself a favour, check it out!"
5-star,1,"kent of inglewood is an awesome store! if you're looking for a battleaxe, you probably won't find that here, but there are plenty of actual axes it that's what you're into. they also have razors, seriously high quality razors. it's definitely worth having a conversation with them to find a great shaving tool. they certainly know what they're talking about. for me, i got a safety razor and have settled on feather blades, but as they'll tell you, it's a highly individual thing. they have exemplary products and customer service. it is well worth a visit no matter where in calgary you live."
2-star,0,limited selection coupled with outrageously expensive prices on mainstream shaving gear. shop online for best selection and prices. this place is not worth anyone's time.
5-star,1,"i'm learning that a man just doesn't wake up one day and find himself with a luscious lady-slaying set of fur on his face. if they found a magic tonic that could do this, i would imagine it'd be an instant nobel price winner, over some research done on cancer or whatever. i'm currently in a quest to reach the highest mustache and beard potential, a.k.a. the nu-manchu and it's been a hard journey. everyone's been calling me manny pacquiao which i suppose is better than someone getting pest control to catch the muskrat growing on my lips. which led me to my visit to kent of inglewood, a men's grooming and shave shop. it's not a store dense with shelves of product, but they have a lot of selection depending on what you're looking for. in this instance i needed something to soften the scruff, but accentuate the ferocity of my nu-manchu. i had no idea what i was talking about or needed. lucky for me, they were helpful enough to let me know on the things i'll need and were reasonable with what i should spend on and don't need to spend on. there were even some encouraging and inspirational words letting me know that ""you're almost there, you're on the right track."" and this coming from someone who had the jaw of earnest hemingway? #inspired #staythecourse #amoveablefeast sure the products might be a bit pricey, but for the knowledge and the quality, it's more than reasonable exchange of value. one could walk into a supermarket and opt to slap on women's hair product on your face, but i'm quite sure women won't make out with a guy who smells like their girlfriend's scalps."
5-star,1,"i absolutely adore this store. they have amazing clothing that works for a large variety of body types, not just one. the clothing is of extremely high quality and design. they offer styles mainly from the 50s and 60s, though i have seen some styles that look more 40s before. the service here is phenomenal. some of the best service i have ever gotten. this is the place i go for all the fancy dresses i might need! and let's just get back to the quality of these dresses! i have beaten the ever loving crap out of my dress and it still looks just as good as the day i bought it (though being rough on clothing provides different experiences for all, you've been forewarned.) this store will forever have my loyalty. i do not plan on going to any other place for retro clothing. ever. thank you kitten retro for being my store. thank you also for giving me some confidence back. for a long time i would try on dresses in stores and they make me look lumpy. i am a curvy girl and i put on the dresses here and they fit like they were tailored to me and make me look fantastic. thank you thank you for being so amazing."
5-star,1,i was window shopping while waiting for my hair stylist. an adorable dress in the window caught my eye. after my appointment i popped in to try it on. i have never felt more welcomed then i did walking into kitten. jennifer the owner was there and was one of the most delightful people i have ever had the pleasure of meeting. the clothes are extremely adorable and affordable. the dress i bought was exactly what i was looking for and fit like a glove. there were so many adorable things. this vibrant boutique is a must try.
5-star,1,"kitten retro glamour is the best shopping experience you'll have in the valley. pimms and her staff are wonderful and make shopping fun. everyone is always smiling and eager to make their customers happy without the pressure of making a sale. going here is like playing dress up- see a unique design? try it on. see something that looks odd and that you know you won't purchase, but you're curious to see how it looks anyway? try it on, you may be surprised. the clothing is adorable and there's always something new to be found. i love that the store includes jewelry and accessories from local artists. be sure to check out the handmade dessert necklaces! the first time i checked out kitten, i was at the melrose location. while i was shopping, a trans woman walked in the store and pimms greeted her with the same enthusiasm as all of her other customers. the woman tried on a few outfits and pimms clapped her hands with excitement and made her feel welcome. kitten does not discriminate and embraces everyone. i already loved the clothes and the shopping experience, but seeing pimms interact with the trans community made me a fan for life. yes, the clothes can be pricey, but bear in mind that this is a boutique that carries clothes from all over the world. the prices are comparable to a site like modcloth, sourpuss, pin up girl clothing, etc., but you are able to try on the clothes in the store and don't have to deal with pesky shipping fees. better yet, kitten carries a variety of sizes, from xs to 3x! vintage sizing can be a pain, but the staff is extremely knowledgeable and helpful. if your size is not available or out of stock, the staff goes the extra mile to special order what you need it's impossible to walk out of kitten without an air of confidence and without catching pimms' contagious smile. kitten retro glamour is an absolute must for fans of all things vintage, pretty, and kitsch!"
4-star,1,pretty cool boutique with lots of fun items! was here during their grand opening in old town as they just relocated from downtown phx. i think a bit more inventory will definitely do them good in the long run. they have a beauty bar now where you can get the complete vintage pin up girl look from head to toe! so fun!!
5-star,1,"the owner of this store is hands down the sweetest human i have had the fortune of dealing with. i can't express my gratitude! due to a shipping snafu, i had an issue i needed resolved, and jennifer sprung into action. not only has everything i purchased through here been gorgeous and promptly shipped, but jennifer's willingness to fix a problem should be properly commended. i live in san diego, and will still prefer to purchase dresses through here than in any local shop. thank you lovely!!!"
5-star,1,"i love this place! the owner is super sweet and has a great selection of vintage inspired clothing and accessories. her prices are great too! make sure you check out her store, you won't regret it!"
5-star,1,yes!!!! no more hunting through the internet trying to find that perfect dress!! this is a gorgeous shop and the owner has great style & taste. she's super sweet and will help you find something you will love! i keep recommending kitten to my glamorous girlfriends and not one has been disappointed. you won't be either!
5-star,1,"my wife and i went here today. she was looking for something to wear for some maternity pin up pictures and was very happy with this store. the girl we believe that was the owner, was awesome. she was very helpful and attended to my wife fantastically. they had sizes big enough for a pregnant girl. my wife will definitely be going back after the baby is born."
5-star,1,"i'm going to be honest. i've avoided this place since they opened in july because i was afraid of sticker shock. my fiance gets his haircut next door every month and i'm usually with him. last weekend was the pinup pop up event and i was getting antsy waiting around so i reluctantly went in to kitten retro glamour expecting to be let down when i looked at the price tags. i totally wasn't! for vintage inspired quality clothing, this place has some of the best prices i've seen! i found a brown faux fur stole that the owner generously placed on hold for me for a week so i could come back to try it on with my wedding dress and it was perfect! i plan on coming back after the holidays to try on a few other items! kitten retro glamour won't let you down!"
5-star,1,this little shop is absolutely adorable and spot on!!! love love love this place!!! the owner is so sweet and welcoming!! can't wait for more new items to arrive!! the clothing is of the best quality i have ever seen!! not cheaply made as i have experienced from other stores.. i will def shop here and invest in this locally owned shop!!!
2-star,0,had a return and exchange at customer service. murria seemed unhappy to help me and chatted with another associate about the missing fitbit keys the whole time. and when my exchange ring up a different price than the rack it was wrong she didn't check. she just basically said i was wrong. i'm glad i don't have a kohl's card. 2 stars because the products at kohls are good quality.
1-star,0,"what great customer service! i knew the day i let my wife talk me into opening a kohls' account i would regret it. so a payment is over looked, they are so nice to call and inform you of the oversight after they report you late to the credit bureau. boycotted for life!"
1-star,0,"it sure would be interesting if kohl's would have more than one register open !!! no wonder there are very persistent rumors that kohl's is on the verge of bankruptcy ! if i could give zero stars, i would...."
2-star,0,this store is very disorganized in its clothing section. good luck finding the correct size considering the size on the hanger does not match the clothing or tag. it is taking longer than expected to purchase what i need.
1-star,0,the store is almost empty and yet you can't get anyone to wait on you. they look the other way when they think you might need help or else they say they are going on a break. how they continue to stay open is beyond me. they don't have any good deals like they did years ago and they have poor quality merchandise. customer service is non-existent.
3-star,0,"this place is so huge! all female wears are on the left side of the store and men wears are on the right. kitchen accessories are in the back of the store. jewelries/accessories/purses/sportswear are located in the middle. overall, the store is relatively organized and staffs seem helpful and friendly. however, clothing styles are somewhat old fashion (or old school) and seems more suitable for customers from 40s and up. i was hoping to find good kitchen accessories at a good deal, but prices are somewhat similar to prices at regular store. nevertheless, they do have good selections for what you might need. this store might not be for me, but i think it's good for general public."
1-star,0,"i was so upset by the staff here!! they were rude and unhelpful! i asked a question to more than one sales associate and they responded back with short, curt answers and went back to complaining about their job and other employees. i will not return to this kohl's!"
5-star,1,"i just had a fantastic experience here. i usually shop this kohls, and like it, but the clearance sale they are having now is unreal. $6 for a tek hoodie!?!? yay!!! the store was super clean and organized. the girl at the register was super sweet and friendly and efficient ( i forgot to check her name). then, after i checked out, i realized that i forgot to use one of my coupons. she directed me back to customer service where hamid helped me. he was able to credit the money i was supposed to save from the coupon back to my credit card easily and was so pleasant about it. i love this store :-)"
4-star,1,"i like kohl's. they have very good sales, and when you go with a coupon you can save a lot. i really appreciate the kohl's cash. i've saved a lot when i go there. i like their selection of jewelery. i can always find a good deal at kohls!"
3-star,0,nice enough store. but there was no sales people to be found when i needed help looking for a specific item in house wares. prices were decent.
2-star,0,"i agree with dam near every review for this place. employees look miserable, and by selling over priced items made by b list celebs like ""marc anthony"", they give the illusion of a great sale. there dress shoes are priced around 90, worth about 40, and hit ""sale"" for 59.99. its very hit and miss when it comes to sizes, esp. at this location. it seems like theyre answer for everything is online delivery, instead of directing me to a store that has my size by doing a simple stock check. then again how much can one really expect from a department store as old as jc pennys. there only saving grace is the coupon stacking that someone mentioned earlier. most places restrict a single coupon per purchase, but ive stacked and left paying 25 bucks for a pretty decent pait of work boots. if you dont have coupons, id go somewhere else."
5-star,1,"make sure you signup for their email list, you'll get 20-30% off coupons each week, then it makes going here a great deal for name brand clothing."
2-star,0,the service at this location is pitiful. not one person smiled or even acknowledged my existence. i needed to make a return and made it through the entire store with no interaction. once i made it to the customer service counter the woman was incredibly rude and said maybe two words to me the entire time. the only reason for the 2nd star is for how easy it is to return items at kohls. skip this location!
5-star,1,"on black friday i had to work but got off in the afternoon and raced to 3 diff kohls to get my sizes in these cool cashmere sweaters that were 100 bucks but marked down to 30.00....i was so happy, i think all the cashiers and dept people are real sweet at kohls too, they are really nice on the phone and go get/hold a size for you then they even find another color to throw in for you...they take it a step beyond and the manager helps out too and they even told me to keep my 32.00 receipt when i get to the next kohls so they can add it in and give me that 10.00 kohl's cash since im buying more and every 50 spent gives you a ten coupon...i love the makeup line there called flirty..lipstick colors nice, special white one called angel and cherub and the lip gloss has a thick brush so you can mix/spread your lipstick & gloss around prettily...so that reminds me, i need to get to kohls this weeknd to get those other makeups i saw since the kohl's cash does have an expiration date. happy shopping! i also like the chaps brand there,,,its kind of a copy of rl and talbot...its pretty. the new kohls at 101- northern is really interesting."
4-star,1,my review here is very neutral. well i was walking on stephen ave and i saw this store. well i am in calgary! this store will come handy during stampede time. they have lots of cowboy boots. lots of cowboy hats. lots of cowboy stuff. friendly staff too.
5-star,1,"hooray for cowboys! this is the best place in calgary to find cowboy boots weather you are new to the city or a country veteran. tons of western wear available here, it isn't just cowboy boots! the staff are so friendly and willing to look up other locations that specific boots are available if their store doesn't carry them. i love that all of their boots are out in the open available for you to try on! decent price for leather boots!"
5-star,1,"this year i had a different job at a new company that was going to provide me with the need to get decked out on an almost daily basis for stampede. so, being the procrastinator that i am, off i went to lammle's the day before it all started. omg was it busy at this location! i was almost overwhelmed by the people, the line, the selection until i realized how quickly people were finding things and being helped. the line was moving really fast! i picked up a shirt and a hat in record time...they had a lot of choice in terms of styles and size - something everyone could feel comfortable in whether you are a conservative dresser or like to let it all hang out for stampede (for the record i'm the former more than the latter). while some stuff seemed expensive to me, the quality is definitely there and the prices for clothing at least, were on par with some online sites i had been to. bonus: they were collecting donations for the recent alberta flood at the till and asking everyone in a classy, non pushy way. they were also very upbeat and friendly despite how insanely busy it was. i'll definitely come back to beef up the stampede wardrobe...and perhaps not do it at the last minute."
5-star,1,"there's a lot of western wear stores to choose from in calgary, but lammle's is a traditional favorite. i don't think i've set foot in one of these shops since the last time i was on a horse, which was ages ago, so it was nice to revisit my equestrian and albertan roots! lammle's has a huge selection of everything: shirts, boots, jeans, hats, belts, and yes, tack. i only went in for a hat and pair of cowboy boots, and was totally overwhelmed by the selection -- but it was easy to find something i liked. the staff is very helpful, which i appreciated because the store was exceptionally busy as it was the first day of stampede. i think the prices at lammle's are reasonable because all their product is good quality, but you will find a range of affordable to expensive pieces depending on what you're looking for. i'll always be a fan!"
4-star,1,"i have purchased pretty much every stitch of my western wear wardrobe here. my cowboots? from lammles. my cowboy hats? from lammles. my very nice looking western shirts? lammles. i've bought books here, i've bought jeans, i've bought bolo ties. i am a fan! every time that i enter this store i am greeted in a very friendly manner. there are always enough staff on hand to help me out. i especially love the service from michelle, a very bubbly complimenting gal! i'm on a first name basis with most of the staff, but if michelle is working she's the one that is going to be helping me. so if you want tremendous service, selection and western hospitality you have to shop here!"
4-star,1,"there are visions synthesized in heads of fellow canadians when you mention the city of calgary. indeed one of these associations must be the ode to all things cowboy/cowgirl, the calgary stampede. from what i have gathered from my time here, the stampede appears to be some preserved tradition that celebrates the spirit of the city and its preservation has nothing to do with the dollars it brings in year after year into the city. in celebration of the wild west, some of us don our cowboy/cowgirl finest much to the delight of some and simultaneous chagrin of other calgarians. for a long time i despised the cowboy theme. perhaps it was because my roots belong to that rival city to the north where anything calgary is shunned and despised. however, as one settles in this city and time flies by the next thing you know you start trying on western wear as a joke or for fun. more time passes and you begin to realize how comfortable cowboy boots can be and you find yourself at lammle's eyeing the latest pair of python-skinned man boots and trying to justify the $250 price tag in your once logical mind. the selection here, and at most lammle stores, is pretty amazing. enough cowboy hats to supply a stephen ave confederate arm...er... police force. more pairs of cowboy/cowgirl boots than at a country and western bar. the service is great, pleasant and very patient. the price is ridiculous, but then again what do i really know about cowboys. maybe this is the price that the market will bare, after all this is the wild west! however, i do know this. if you are looking somewhere fun to window shop or for great stampede wear or if you want to look like mantracker, lammle's should be on your list of places to visit. 14/30 - yelp 30 day challenge"
5-star,1,"this is my absolutely favourite place in the city to buy gifts and treat yoself (myself). heidi and nikki are two amazing owners who really strive to make their store unique and inspiring! with many canadian-made options from jewellery, greetings cards, wine shhhhhtuff, shtuff for our men and even baby and pups! they host amazing events, and they are far too generous with their giveaways! last christmas they did 12 days of giveaways and at one point the giveaway was an amazing door mat!! not only can you feel good that you are getting friggin cool accessories and unique items but you can feel good supporting two amazing women who's dream is to give calgary and awesome boutique. also, their instagram stories and videos are worth getting up in the morning, trust me."
5-star,1,"calgary's east village is an up-and-coming neighborhood. it's development has been slowed down by lower oil prices (the big industry in these parts), so who knows what this area will look like next year. in the meantime, there's enough construction here to imagine the possibilities. that includes the retail outposts like liz & lottie who have staked their success on their stylish taste and the promise of a lot more foot traffic past their shop. i wandered on a recent friday afternoon and thoroughly enjoyed this version of retail therapy. liz & lottie is more geared perhaps to those who are ""sugar and spice and everything nice"", but for folks like me (e.g. snips and snails and puppy dog tails), there some interesting things, plus loads of gift opportunities. i also enjoyed their nice selection of local and canadian items and their good taste in selecting and displaying their wares. liz & lottie was definitely worth the extra bit of east village discovery exploration. best wishes for your continued success."
5-star,1,"nikki and heidi are my favs!!!! also, their shop is amazing! filled with the most current, trendy and ridiculously fun gadgets and gifts - this place is the perfect stop for the hard to shop for person. also, the perfect place for everything you want yourself. it's tidy and perfect! if their witty instagram doesn't pull you in - their amazing personalities will"
5-star,1,"love this little shop, it's the perfect place to pop into if you need a gift for someone or your just looking at spoiling yourself! if your unsure of what this place has well a little bit of everything! it's great if your looking at adding some cool glass wear to your collection or needing a little oneise for a baby shower! the owners, nikki and heidi are amazing and super helpful! they picked out everything you see in the shop, and they have a great sense of humour added to the space and the pieces you can find. i have to control myself whenever i walk in because i want everything! the shops easy to get to right off of downtown, and they have parking right out front! i suggest you head down and check out the space, i'm sure you'll leave with a bag in hand!"
5-star,1,"you've gotta love a gift shop where you can go in and find beautiful things for everyone on your list (and a gift or two for yourself!) my super stylish and in the know sister in law has been finding awesome gifts at liz & lottie for everyone in the family since they've opened and i have been following them on instagram to keep tabs on the new items coming into the shop. the two owners are super kind and helpful, i've messaged them on instagram with shopping requests/items i am looking for and they have sent me back pictures of products they have in store that match the request -- how nice is that! i often visit on my lunch break as they are tucked into the east village at the bottom of one of the high rises but it's easy to get there either from walking through the river walk, taking the train to the end of the free line then going for a short stroll or driving right up there. on this visit i walked away with gift for four upcoming events! a sassy and slightly inappropriate valentines card for my husband, a baby shower gift, a gender reveal party gift and a birthday party gift. trust me i could have kept shopping! great place to find all sorts of treasures including local and canadian makers which is so great to see."
5-star,1,"i love longchamp, having first discovered the brand in paris with a lovely little bag i owned for many years, and which i rediscovered recently with one of their beautiful leather totes. it's the perfect bag, honestly - well made, beautiful, and highly functional. sooo when my friends and i walked by this store in caesar's, i had to stop in. the saleslady was very attentive, and though i'm sure having a longchamp bag slung over my shoulder didn't hurt, she absolutely noticed what i was looking at, noticing, and responding to, and so was incredibly helpful. i wanted a wallet, but slightly larger than my current one, and she immediately honed in on what my needs were and especially what colors i liked. when i had narrowed it down to two wallets, she could absolutely tell which one i kept coming back to - i wanted to like the pink, but i actually liked the blue more. i'm thrilled with my wallet and the color choice. i enjoyed the store experience overall and the sales help was first-rate. i cannot wait to stop in again. it's expensive, to be sure, but when you have the money for one of their items, it's a purchase that you won't regret."
1-star,0,"the bad experience in this shop! the sales ignores when people walk in the shop and asking her details about bag. finally, bought three bags from this shop. thank you for your service!"
1-star,0,"sadly, no awesome asian-lady salesperson to help me. got another girl who was very rude about my exchange. gave me a funny look when i asked about an exchange and her tone assumed i was trying to exchange used merchandise. when i told her i just came back from another longchamps store in another country two days ago, she quickly changed her tune. considering i bought a total of 7 les pliages large bags, i thought she'd be a little lenient in allowing me to exchange two bags from last season; a fact not relayed to me by the salesperson in the previous store. i bought the bags for my siblings but a few of the colors didn't work out. nonetheless, she was completely unsympathetic and treated me like i was out of place. it was quite offensive frankly, and i would have loved to just return the whole load with the way i was treated but their no returns policy was pointed out from the get go by the snooty salesperson."
5-star,1,"i love longchamp totes. ever since i bought my first one 4 years ago, i can't ever use a different bag. it's light, roomy, stylish, durable, and very affordable. for about $150, it's an absolute steal. i've used my large le pilage tote as my: everyday purse, work bag, overnight bag, gym bag, laptop bag, travel bag, etc. basically, i use it for everything. as a result, i was thrilled to see that the forum has a longchamp store! there are so many steps and colors to choose from! in addition, the customer service is top notch. the employees are friendly, helpful, and non-pretentious unlike the employees at some other handbag retailers at the forum (*ahem* louis vuitton *ahem*). they also have a great sale section! i picked up 2 totes the other day for about $30 under the retail price. this store is definitely one of my faves in las vegas and that says a lot!!! definitely a must stop spot out here!"
5-star,1,"was window shopping while husband was at the casino. came in to the store and was greeted by a pretty asian sa. she was very attentive, and very patient. i wasnt intending on buying another longchamp (i have almost a dozen), but she was so amazing that i ended up buying a large le pliage cuir in pebble. thank you ms yuko.. youre amazing!"
4-star,1,i think the le pliage totes are overpriced but i was tickled to see that some of their le pliage totes were going for about $30 below retail which is nice because they are overpriced to begin with. this store is pretty nice. if i feel like dropping $200 on a purse or so i wouldn't mind going here. the atmosphere is quite pleasant.
5-star,1,service was great here. the asst. manager helped me and i could not be happier. i will place future orders from this location to be shipped to me. thanks again.
4-star,1,"true, how can a nylon looking bag can be so expensive...that's what i used to think about longchamp bags. however, after seeing my friends carrying the bags for functional purpose, stuffing the bag with their laptop, books, etc, i decided that i want one for christmas. i dropped by longchamp store on tuesday afternoon to exchange my planetes bag for a size up. the staff were very helpful and friendly. it was a no-hassle exchange. the bag is very durable and serves more for functional use than for looks. when i am in need to a wallet, i will return. but for now, since the wallet is almost the same price as the bag itself, that can wait."
1-star,0,"this store sucks! customer service is severely lousy. i sent in my bag for repair but they said that the bag is not repairable and therefore it is throwable. the manager and the associate just emailed me and told me that they cannot replace it it is not repairable and i can call customer service and that is it. now where is customer service there? no suggestions on what to do, no after care service. the bag is over rated to be durable and long lasting, i had mine for 2 weeks only and now it is for repair but actually it is for disposal since longchamp does not want to fix their mediocre bag, what a disappointment!"
4-star,1,"i strongly dislike those canvas totes in the 'le pliage' line with leather trimmings that seemed to be a recurring trend around 09/10, another laughable way luxury companies tempt aspiring customers into their brand through the cheapest means possible. since when is canvas luxurious? ditto with their 'ceci n'est pas un it bag' bags. they're cute, but i'd never spend more than $20 on one of them. still canvas, longchamp. i do, however, adore their leather goods. from experience, they're worth the price, and are a classic luxury purchase. longchamp is one of the few accessory houses still family owned and operated. this brings you quality, and consistency over mass-market appeal, penny-pinching design and quality flaws. this location has excellent, unpretentious service. i heartily recommend!"
1-star,0,"this place deserves a negative review. came here to get my folio case looked at because the glazing started peeling after only a month of use. the sa anthony and some random manager looked at me and my case and told me that there was nothing wrong with it, even though there was clear cracking and peeling. i tried to explain the issues and showed them the cracking, to which they replied that it was normal wear and tear, and asked me what i wanted from them like i was looking for a freebie. i told them i just wanted to make sure that this wasn't a defect. not the experience i was expecting from louis vuitton. i went over to the boutique at wynn and they were much more friendly. they acknowledged my concerns, and agreed to send out my case for reglazing. the store at the wynn is 100000x better."
5-star,1,"i brought my emilie wallet for hot stamp my initials, misa was very helpful and friendly. she even call me later in the afternoon to ask me what colors i want for the chinese logo that i choose. very nice of her! i recommend her and of course i will make my future purchases with her."
5-star,1,"favorite lv location in las vegas. super convenient to stop by and lots of merchandise. i met misa here on my first purchase which was the pochette metis. i went in on random day trying to find a bag that was sold out everywhere and even had a waiting list (was the pochette mettis). asked her if they so happen to have it, and she said ""as a matter a fact we do, we received one this morning"". my heart stopped for a bit of how excited i was. talk about faith. from there on, i only shopped with her. misa does a great job providing excellent customer service. she's super sweet and very honest which i love. can't wait to keep my louis vuitton collection growing with her help."
5-star,1,"great service from the staff at this location. my wife and i visit several times a year and enjoy the knowledge and attentiveness the sales professionals provide. some of the other reviews complain about the selection but there has never been any issue purchasing what we need regardless of where it is, they make things happen."
1-star,0,"the experience in the store was short lived. i wasn't greeted when i entered, but that was not a huge issue. the main issue was the fact that my cousin and i were instantly degraded. we just got done with a quick work out and decided to look around the mall. we chose louis vuitton because i was planning on getting my mother a gift for the holidays. one of the sales associates was rude and was following us around the store as if we were ready to grab something and run. he barely spoke a word to us. after noticing that my cousin and i were actually interested, he asked, ""do you need help with anything?"" it was very quick and stern. as my cousin and i realized that we felt very unwelcome, we decided to head out without another word. right as we left the store, i turn my head to see that the same sales associate followed us all the way out. it was a little humiliating and quite rude. but i'm not even mad though."
1-star,0,i had a bad customer experience. walked in and was barley greeted. all the employees were busy helping the few customers in store. i already had an idea of what i wanted to go in and get. when i got a chance to i asked the sales lady i wanted to look at the neverfull mm in damier and she got it for me and walked away for like 10 mins as i stood there waiting to be helped nobody approached me. when she came back i told her i was ready to cash out and she quickly cashed me out. i didn't get the 5 star customer experience i expected walking into a luxury store to purchase a high priced item. i understand that they might of all been a bit busy helping customers but the fact that nobody would acknowledge me or make eye contact to assure me that assistance was coming was very disappointing.
5-star,1,came in and didn't have the bag available in the color my mom wanted. reserved the bag & was able to buy it a day later. amazing service on both days i went. very accommodating and quick. the staff was so friendly both in store and on the phone.
1-star,0,don't shop here!!! my daughter saved up her money and bought a bag here the first week of march. she had them ship her one to her house so no sales tax. of course that one was not the one she looked at. we were on vacation for 2 weeks and she started carrying it last week and noticed it has a cut in the leather. she was devastated and crying! customer service said they would have the store manager contact her and set up an exchange. the store manager called her and said..no way...not exchanging...don't care how much money you spent! pretty much accused her of cutting it...which she would so do so she could send back for the same purse in exchange...dumb a**!! i was getting ready to order myself another bag this week and i have such a bad taste in my mouth i will never buy one again nor carry the ones i have!!! what happened to their reputation? down the tubes......
5-star,1,"the staff is super nice here, took time to show me different kinds of purses, i came in for a small handbag and found the perfect one! i'm in love!!"
5-star,1,"this store carries a wide selection of handbags and accessories to choose from. the staff are also very very friendly and helpful. i dropped by the store last night just to browse around and jill monzon was a great help. unfortunately, i was unsure of the handbag i really wanted. but came back the next day and made the purchase with misa. she was also very sweet and took her time with me. overall, it's always a pleasure shopping at this louis!!!"
1-star,0,"terrible. defective products. no customer service. i've purchased four bags and four wallets for myself and friends. these seemed beautiful and lifetime quality... at first. several months down the road the vernis finish on the strap of one of my bags started to peel off, then off the other bag. i brought the bags in and asked them if they could repair them or possibly replace the straps. they wouldn't do anything. they literally shook their heads at me. it was weird and awkward. needless to say i don't go in there anymore and have nothing to do with that product. terrible customer service. i even cringe when i walk past the store at the fashion show mall as it reminds me of this."
1-star,0,"not so.. ""holly jolly christmas"" i decided to treat myself to a designer wallet after finishing up some last minute shopping saturday 12.24.16 when i walked in i was given a ""my shift is almost over and i despise my job"" greeting from a young male associate. i asked the young man if he could direct me to the wallets and he pointed to the right and said over there. my immediate reaction was pretty shocked and surprised that he didn't escort me ""over there"" to the wallet section but none-the-less i found it. to my surprise after a short wait the same gentleman came over to ""assist"". i asked for a specific wallet (josephine) and he pulled out two different wallets. another sales associate interjected and directed him to the correct wallet. the display was the remaining wallet left and i asked if he could check an alternate location. the gentleman gentleman quickly responded, ""there's nothing wrong with this one."" i should have left the store at that point but the didn't. after checking the wallet for imperfections i decided to proceed with the purchase. the gentleman seemed a bit delayed and actually shared that his brain was fried today. after purchasing the wallet and waiting for him to deliver it to me the gentleman realized i didn't sign the receipt and circled back. just when i thought things couldn't get any worse when the gentleman finally brought the wallet out there were police offices inside the store. instead of asking his manager why the police were there he asked me, ""why are the po pos here?"" i thought to myself this gentleman lacks professionalism and should be unemployed. i'm confident this young man would not have used slang if he didn't think he could ""get away with it."" mr. anthony gomez you are by far one of the worst sales associates i've ever encountered. i recommend you take your job more seriously all the time instead of when you feel like it."
5-star,1,"quickly update for new arrivals,and giving nice services. associates are really helpful and kind. i already looked up in online louis vuitton site,and told them i know what i want,and i was in bit of hurry. but they helped me really fast with professional services. i always visit this lv store. better than other stores in vegas!"
1-star,0,"wow!! yes, the service is excellent when you are buying not so much when their product fails bc of inherent defects. adorable bags but they dont stand behind their products. i have several lv accessories, and i took my bag in bc it developed a tear where the canvas naturally folded down. they refused to fix it telling me that a purse ""won't last forever""! it was 4 years old. how much do you think it actually costs them to fix one of these cheap canvas based bags?! $25?? you are paying for the name, not the material!! ummm excuse me, but i have lots of luxury items and they actually stand behind their products (tiffany, rolex, chanel, gucci, ssl, tory birch, d&g). so, before you buy this brand, know that they will arrogantly deny fixing anything lest it happen within the first year of purchase- and only then if you are lucky. #lastlvpurchase #wasteofmoney #unsatisfiedlv #spendyourmoneyelsewhere if you want to be treated like a luxury client, or simply with respect, i highly suggest you seek products elsewhere. lv just doesn't offer the value it used to compared to other retailers, many of which actually hold their value."
5-star,1,"this is my favorite louis vuitton location in las vegas. i shop here often and everyone is very friendly, attentive and professional. love the selection and ease of walking in/out of store. i do not like walking past tons of tourists just to go shopping, i love being able to shop in peace. i truly love customizing my luggage pieces and my pieces always arrive on time, as promised. during one visit, i bought three luggage accessories for my luggages (they found at the aria location) but brought it to their location on time for me. i appreciate their punctuality and commitment to their valued clients. keep up the excellent service, i'll continue to purchase in this location."
5-star,1,"this is my favorite lv store in vegas! the staff is great and very accommodating especially niko!! he always goes above and beyond to make sure i get exactly what i want, and does it with a smile and positive energy!"
1-star,0,"i'm officially done purchasing lv products after today! i went in for a repair on a purse and was told that because it had a crack that they could not repair the strap, rendering my purse unusable. it also took several times to even get a semi-logical explanation from the manager. neither she nor the clerk was capable of explaining why it could not be repaired. the only logical response though would have been that they can try to repair it, but cannot guarantee the repair. instead, i was told to take it to a local shoe repair shop. done! i encourage my friends, sorority sisters, family, etc., to be aware that lv does not stand behind their products. select a different ""luxury"" bag."
1-star,0,this is one of the worst place i been too - i can't believe a manager at fashion show mall - karen mesa - she was not willing to give any solution on a wallet that i spent over 400.00 dollars... when the thread is coming out! she was the worst manager for a high end retail company.
4-star,1,"my husband suggested we visit this store so that we can scout out some purses for my potential birthday gift. i had a vague idea of what i wanted since i have kept up with the models, and have purchased from them before. (you're welcome mom!). the store is relatively compact, yet has most of the popular models, sizes and patterns. we were greeted at the entrance and did not experience any snobbery from the staff. i do suffer from what the kids call rbf (resting b*tch face) so people do tend to think i am aloof. i was immediately approached and offered help. the lady helping me was very accommodating and patient. i had her showcase three different purses i was torn between, and even had her bring them out in different patterns and sizes. pro tip: damier azur pattern tends to transfer color from dark outfits, especially denim. the stains/darkened patches cannot be removed or cleaned. it is something to consider if you're thinking of opting for that pattern. there was no pressure from the sales team to purchase anything on the spot, and i was glad i did scout out the bags in person because what i thought i wanted, i ended up not liking. i left the store with some enlightenment and a few new tips i was not aware of before. i would go back here to complete my purchase."
1-star,0,"absolutely horrible service! i went into exchange a pair of sunglasses i got as a gift. i wanted to exchange for a wallet because my parents have gotten me sunglasses for the last 5 years. i gave her the glasses she pulled them out to check them and do the return and said the glasses had a scratch but wouldn't show me where. she then proceeded to bag the sunglasses up, and tell me that they were eligible for a return. i am totally unsure how they have a scratch when i literally only opened them and boxed them straight back up. on top of that they have a sunglasses bag, case and a box. how do you even manage to get them scratched horrible service will not go back!"
4-star,1,"one of what must be 700 lv boutiques in vegas, the fashion show mall location is decent sized, carries a good range of most lv products. they've got a much bigger selection of women's accessories - as is the case with most lv boutiques - but options for men's are still plenty. service wise, i've had fairly good luck here over the course of a few shopping trips, with one especially great experience with danna cruz. on the hunt for a few small gifts for friends and family, she took the time to listen to my needs, then suggested appropriate items, wrapped them up, and even called a couple of the other other local lv boutiques when they didn't have the style i wanted. not all lvs deliver an excellent experience - and to be honest, very few do it consistently - but this one is at the top of my list."
4-star,1,"when my mother in law comes into town we always have a good time and on this visit we spent the day shopping. since we both own a few lv we can appreciate the brand but not the hike in prices that have skyrocketed over the years. we asked the saleslady a few questions about specific pieces we owned and what the value is now-and honestly they've almost doubled. my mother in law was regretting not buying the bag she wanted a few years back. i was grateful i bought my doggy bag and other pieces way back when too. she looked at a few bags and the saleslady was very patient. nice place to browse and shop for that special gift if you're wallet is big enough! you can find shoes, luggage bags, sunglasses and accessories at this store. located on the second floor across from tiffany & co another favorite high-end store."
1-star,0,"salespersons lack customer service...very judgmental and snobbish. these workers believe they are somebody because of the nice suits they wear, when in fact they are just nobody (located at fashion show mall)"
2-star,0,"i'm only giving this store two stars because the sales associate that we had to approach was helpful and very patient. first off my girlfriend and i along with her two sisters walk into the empty store, not one out of the 4 associates, greeter/guard, and bald douche bag manager even bothered to acknowledge us. we then stood in the middle of the store for about 2 to 3 minutes trying to find the list of bags we wanted to purchase, everyone there continued to bullshit around (two sales associates were standing and talking not even 4 feet away from us). we had to finally approach a lady behind a counter for help, god knows how long it would have taken if we waited for someone to approach us. after we finished paying we were waiting for our purchase to get boxed and bagged up, the bald douche bag felt the need to make rounds around us thinking we were going to steal something. if that was the manager seriously shame on him and that sorry excuse for customer service, i've seriously had better service at fast food joints. then the cherry on top was after we were about to leave we briefly looked at a wallet case near the entrance and one of the two associates that were having the conversation earlier finally asked if we needed help after she notice the large box/bag we had. i don't normally bitch about customer service, but this store stereotyped the shit out of us. if you want a pleasant shopping experience i suggest you skip the fashion show location and go to the wynn or forum shops. i've never had a problem with either of those locations. end rant"
5-star,1,"where: located inside the fashion show mall. when: 10am-9pm, monday through saturday. 10am-8pm, sunday. why: to get your louis v fix on. what: firstly, i would like to state that this is one of the smaller louis vuitton stores in las vegas. there isn't a huge selection like there is inside the wynn and the forum shops, but it'll do. the advice i'd give is, if you know what you're looking for, call them in advance to check if the item you have is there. that's what i did, and when i showed up to pick it up, i was completely satisfied. as my mom and i walked inside the store, the doorman greeted us so kindly. one of the employees immediately asked us if we needed any help. i knew what i wanted, and he gladly helped me make my decision. he gave such wonderful choices and knew about each of the pieces i asked about. i love someone who knows their product! so, to end this in a good way... customer service was grade a, five stars, and a thumbs up!! =d"
3-star,0,"i thought maybe the lv in this mall would be a little more ""wow"", but it isn't. i'd have to give big props to the wynn which has the coolest lv boutique in vegas."
5-star,1,"lucky you! this location at miracle mile seems to be better stocked than the fashion mall location. the sale rack had by far much more selection. i found two tops that i had been eye spying online that i could try on in person and purchase just the right size. the sales people were helpful and gave their honest opinion on the exact, perfect fit for me. happy with my purchases and feel like i scored!"
3-star,0,"i like the brand itself a lot, but a couple of the sales people were really off putting. one made some age crack trying to be funny (it wasn't), and the other who cashed me out was about as apathetic as possible. definitely won't be back."
5-star,1,"great service, great clothes, reasonable prices. i'm a guy in my forties and my sales pro got me into a perfect set of jeans, upsold me a nice shirt but didn't overdo it. i will definitely be back."
5-star,1,"i have never really shopped at lucky brand but after this vegas experience, they have a loyal customer. the guy that worked their was so friendly and helpful. i would have bought ocean front property in vegas from him. he made great suggestions, helped find several styles of jeans that would work and very knowledgeable about each style (including how they will stretch out). they had some great deals! $40 off of jeans (still expensive, but now a much better deal) and 40% off of clearance. i felt like everything in the store was stylish and high quality, but you already knew that! :)"
5-star,1,"i love the every time i've walked in to a lucky store, they always guess the exact size and style of jeans that i'm wearing. this time i also bought a bunch of shirts. the staff offered advice and opinions and was very helpful through out."
5-star,1,"my dh is the most impossible person to buy jeans for in the entire world! whenever we find a pair that fits and he likes them, we buy at least 2 pairs. he has been in desperate need of jeans for a few months now, so when we saw the lucky store in the mall we decided to go in. the guy that helped us out was really nice and kept pulling different styles and sizes for him. we scored when he found a pair that he likes...and it was buy one get one 1/2 off!! you can't beat that!!"
5-star,1,"i will never buy another brand of jeans after finding lucky about 2 yrs ago. ive talked friends that would never dare spend that much on a pair of jeans into becoming true addicts like me. (some joke that i should be their spokes person) their tshirts are a bit expensive for my taste, but as soon as you put them on you can see why. their the softest most puuuurfect fitting tshirts ive found (even talked mom, the clearance rack queen into buying some). the most important thing that keeps me back is the service...i go to the fashion show a lot. lucky is the only store that always greats me with a 'honest' friendly hello.. a few of the guy remember me and have learned my taste so they're very quick to show me the new stuff that they just know ill love..and i will..cause i'm such a sucker in that store. ;)"
5-star,1,"ok so i love lucky brand. if you've never put your ass in lucky's then you would not know what i'm talking about. lucky's just feel good. like jeans that have already been broken in...but new. it's got that old rock and roll style with a little ibiza hippie in it. everything is just soft! i got into l lucky's years ago and from that point on i was hooked. 95% of my jeans are lucky. all my cargos are lucky. 80% t-shirts...lucky. i even have my own personal shopper at lucky. erin's the manager at this lucky and she's always been really good about helping me. brad is my personal lucky shopper at fashion show mall. he usually informs me of sales, and special lucky events. yea so if there's something i splurge on....it's lucky. this store is a little bigger than the one at fashion show. i kinda like the desert passage a little better. plus there's this lucky buddha in the front of the store. this lucky is more brightly lit than the one at fashion show. i'm starting to get sick of saying the word ""lucky"" but it's ok. because i love lucky brand. btw there's a lucky shirt that has pignose amps on it. you should buy it. because it's my uncle's company and if you don't know pignose. then you don't rock!"
5-star,1,i adore this location. the staff are extremely helpful and super friendly. same prices as everywhere else but the customer service is phenomenal. i will 100% return to this location.
5-star,1,"amazing service! i absolutely love this location. all of the employees are super friendly and helpful. they are patient and will keep bringing you styles until you find something great! i was in the store for about an hour after they officially closed and the staff were really cool with it. i kept apologizing and they said, ""don't worry! we're still here!"" i will definitely make this my go-to lulu store. note to head office: please bring back the groove pants with a bootcut or a similar style pant. those styles look the best on me. the skinny ones weren't too amazing on my curvy and petite frame but i bought it anyways... thank you! one of your loyal customers. :)"
5-star,1,"i like the concept of lululemon. they inspire you to go running, do yoga and look good doing them. i visit their website often to get motivation. i have been to their free yoga class once and i loved it. i have not regretted buying a thing from this store. i use my sweaters, shorts, sports bra and tank top that i purchased over the last 2 years regularly. they are still in good shape even after hundreds of washes. the staff is very helpful."
4-star,1,"this lululemon's location will always be special for me. i participated in their annual parkinson yoga thorn every year for the last 3 years. make sure you get those raffle tickets! the price is just so awesome: blue jays tickets, lulu's top, cook books..... and all for a good cause!! i led my first ever community class in this location. my first class in a store with mix level with over 30 yogis! that's memorable! the staffs always so kind and supportive and friendly. this lululemon is more than just another yoga clothing store for me!!"
4-star,1,"i go to this location quite often as it's very close to my regular yoga studio. the staff here is always very friendly, helpful & enthusiastic. i find the common sizes are gone fast here so you have to hurry & call if you want smth. they have no probs reserving an item for you as long as you're there by end of day. there's always a small markdown section everytime i go in."
1-star,0,disgusting service. i was in the store for almost 30 mins and not one person said anything to me. the associates were too busy talking about a trip to miami ! you're an outlet store ... could you be any lower on the food chain?
5-star,1,"i am so happy that i came across this place. and at the same time, so so sad that is in arizona and not in santa barbara. they are organized by size which is genius. they have eliminated the time consumed by pawing through a million different racks of clothes to find a damn size eight. three pairs of lulu's for what i would pay for two. yasss. so much joy filled my heart. this place is a gem & i will be visiting again on my next trip to az."
4-star,1,nice shop with great customer service. you'll enjoy the lower prices of the outlet. they do have a limited selection compared to their scottsdale location. their employees call you by first name and give you all the attention you want.
5-star,1,"the lululemon outlet is always a must for me during any trip to phoenix. in los angeles we don't have any lulu outlets and most of the lulu storefronts barely have a clearance rack, but this storefront is a dream. when you walk in, men's clothing is at the front to the right and women's clothing takes up all of the back and the right. you never know what to expect when you get here (i've had days that are both hit and miss), but that's the charm of this place. they usually have special deals that are bigger than others ($29 sweatpants, $39 jackets, etc.) as well as a store-wide deal (additional 15% off everything, extra 25% off all bottoms, etc.) which usually drive my focus. the staff in the dressing rooms is incredibly helpful in terms of giving you feedback if you're shopping alone or making sure you find that perfect outfit! just one word of warning - there are no returns for purchases at this location so make sure you really want something when you get it!"
4-star,1,i always have to stop by this store when i come in town. they change the deals everyday that is posted on the board right when you walk in. the employees that work here are always sooooooo sooooo nice. they are helpful and sweet. i wish most places would get this kind of customer service to make every shopping experience great. i have referred many friends to try this location out not only for the deals but for the experience you get when you come here. if i lived close by i would be here every week. fortunately for my bank account i live a few hours away
4-star,1,the prices aren't super discounted compared to surrounding stores but you can still get some good deals! they had super cute clothes unfortunately very few options for sizes 2-6 which i believe are the most common :/ and you can't just order them online in your size and get the same price. i did pick out 3 pairs of leggings and 2 sports bras and it came out to a little under $300 but still around $100 cheaper than retail!!!
5-star,1,"this store is well worth the drive from gilbert. while i love lulu, i haven't always been met with the same friendliness at all nearby locations. this one, however, is delightful. the prices are very reasonable and i look forward to many more day trips to glendale."
5-star,1,"when i saw that they had an outlet store for lululemon, i was so happy! i've heard so many wonderful things about this brand but when i saw the prices (online), it made me cry. my friends that have the clothing say it's totally worth it. so i wanted to get it out for myself. but with this being an outlet, the prices are lower than what i saw online. when i walked in, i was greeted with a price list. so the prices on the tags were higher than what they had on this list. so i seriously felt like this was a great deal! the store is organized by size and it seemed a little chaotic with all the people. the store is small so you definitely bump into people while looking for a size. i was able to find exactly what i was looking for, but there really wasn't too much of a variety. i could've easily spent more money at this store, but held back being this is my very first lululemon purchase. i wanted to see if it what i had purchased, lived up the representation. it has so far. the employees were very friendly. i recommend stopping at this store if you're in the area... or not in the area!"
4-star,1,nice store and friendly staff. i wish there were more items in my size though. it is nice to have another option instead of having to check the retail stores sale rack daily. i love their clothes to workout it in because they don't feel sweaty and they don't ride up or get stuck like other brands.
5-star,1,"this review is for the customer service. i was visiting from out of state and noticed they had a sale. even though the store was crowded, everything was organized and i was asked by every employee if i needed help. once back at my hotel that night i realized my diamond pendant necklace was missing from my neck. i was panicking because i had visited a gazillion places that day across the state and had no idea where i had lost it. i called this store and yes an amazing employee had found it on the fitting room floor and they had it. so thankful for their honesty and professionalism. will definitely be back here on my next visit to phoenix!"
2-star,0,"i stopped here on the way home from the zoo hoping for some bargains but truth be told, you'll do better price wise on the clearance racks at a regular retail lululemon store or on line in the ""we made too much"" section. for example, they had a white pacesetter running skirt for $49. i bought mine on clearance at the chandler mall for $39 and it's currently on sale on line for $34. they did have a large quantity of sales items, the whole store is sales items and the store is divided into sizes so that's handy but prices were more than i expected."
5-star,1,"i have come here about ten times now since i first discovered it, and i have yet to be disappointed. i got all of my christmas gifts for friends here and i don't think i have been to the actual lulu store since i found this place."
1-star,0,"i came here the first part of august and found some great bottoms and tops. store was very busy, tons of help and best of all they did a flash sale, 3 bottoms for $100!! today i came and it was horrible from beginning to end. to start, there was a football game but other than traffic i really didn't think parking would be an issue. they tried to charge me $10 to park which i flat out refused to pay, even after i was told it could go towards my purchase. i parked for free. upon entering the store i was greeted and told where the sale items were. i went to the racks where the pants were. not only were they very ugly (outlet store) they were all priced at $89 or more. seriously not much less than going to the normal stores and getting great merchandise. the help wasn't any better. in the back they were dancing and all the others were having private conversations. oh and did i mention that i was the only one in the store. it was pretty pitiful. i'm not real sure if i'll ever be back."
4-star,1,"a few weeks ago i googled ""lululemon outlets"" on a whim to see where the few chosen locations in the country were. i figured my best bet to catch one would be on a future road trip out to california or something. imagine my immediate heart attack when i saw lululemon westgate ""opening soon""...what! you better believe i hauled my cookies way out yonder to check out the location. there's not many things that prompt me to drive 40 minutes to glendale, but yes, the lulu outlet is definitely one of them. i love that it's organized by size. makes hunting down your styles super easy. i've read a few people on their facebook complaining about the selection of shorts, but i thought they easily made up for it in the pants section, at least in the 6 and 8 sections i fall into. employees were super friendly as usual. if anything, i'd say the store went a little overboard in stocking outerwear, but i'm sure they can't pick and choose what they receive from hq's ""we made too much."" not necessarily a huge need in the valley, but i can see how this would be an insane find for people visiting from colder climates. i walked out with a pair of full-length wunder unders and two tanks for about $60 less than i've paid for at a regular lulu. absolutely worth the trek! yay!"
4-star,1,this is one of the better locations in the area. i love that they offer high end designer clothing for discounted prices. not all marshalls' have super high end designer clothing offered. today i bought a derek lam dress for $150. they had herve lever for $400. they have a lot of the smaller design houses too - i'm impressed. what's not so impressive is their home goods section. it's lacking. stick to the clothes and the beauty section - they are generally pretty good at this store. i'll continue to shop this location!
4-star,1,"this isn't my closest marshalls but it will definitely do! i shopped around. looked at shoes, houseware and a few knick knacks. overall, the store was pretty organized. i did get a pair of kate spade sandals for $18 what what!! i got a few pillows and some things that i probably didn't need to spend money on. i didn't wait long to check out and the clerk was pretty friendly. overall, the experience was good!"
5-star,1,"i love this location. there are lots of homegoods options and a large selection of clothing. their intimates section appears to be double the size of most stores. the checkout line was full when i visited but they moved people through quickly and when the line was long, other staff came up front to open more registers. everyone i interacted with was friendly and helpful."
4-star,1,"it's hard not to leave without a careful of stuff, but it's definitely worth it. shoes, clothes, furniture, pet stuff, food, gifts, it's amazing! this is one of my favorite stores because it's easy to see everything and not as cluttered as other marshalls. while i love their english mugs (hard to find) and clothes, my favorite find is the carlsbad oblaten cookies. i know what you're thinking, just cookies? what? no you don't understand, these are my favorite cookies on earth and i cannot find them anywhere else. they are very expensive on qvc if you're lucky enough to catch them, but they're only $7.99 at marshalls. i check back constantly to snatch as many as i can find, but recently it's been very hard to find a box of them. i hope they order more for the holidays because i just don't know where else to get my precious cookies!"
5-star,1,clean and organized. a great treat to visit when i am on this side of town. i appreciate the friendliness of the staff especially the older lady that works in the dressing room.
4-star,1,love that i can find a good selection and some great name brands. i like to stop in just to see what they have from time to time
4-star,1,"what's in store for men today as of this morning, boss, brooks brothers, brunello cucinelli, corneliani, diesel, eton, gucci, marmot, ralph lauren (green, purple, and black labels), john varvatos, just cavali, theory, versace, vince, and z zegna were interspersed between dozens of lesser known labels and lots of 'christmas' sweaters. however, in comparison to other marshalls, the men's selection here is better, which makes shopping this location most interesting. while there are many racks containing a 1/2 dozen of the same sweater, polo shirt, or tie, occasionally, you'll find that unique and well made item separating itself from the fashion drones. prices for ""designer"" or better maker items can range from $60 to $600 for an italian made cashmere pullover. better maker winter coats have a range but seem to top off at $1300. in general, marshalls has a tendency to dress men casually from the waste up. this one is no exception. you won't find men's shoes, or quality men's trousers. however, van husen, hagaar, dockers and the like are plentiful if you desire nothing fancier. for better, a trip to your favorite department store, or clothier will serve you better. before you go dashing to the men's section, to have a look at all of the above mentioned labels, you should be aware of its limitations. 1) if you're the type of man who likes a 10 min or less shopping experience because by job, you're a man, and stabbing a thing, tossing it over your shoulder and taking it home is what you are born to do, this location is not for you. it's cramped in a claustrophobic way. the racks and tables are disheveled. it's poorly organized. the lighting is bad, and you're going to have to turn your inner hunter into a gatherer...leaving no t-shirt unturned. 2)that purple versace zip up could only be pulled off by a couple of guys with caribbean heritage, liberace, or sir elton john. there are dozens more designer items falling into that category. it appears marshalls buys overstock, but they also buy menswear for that special invitation to pee-wee's big adventure, or your own. overall, i'd recommend it for spare time browsing rather than for when you have a specific article in mind."
5-star,1,"i came to charlotte for a business trip and being the avid tj, marshalls, and home goods shopper that i am i had to see what the charlotte location had to offer. seriously, i have been to stores all acorss the country and this is hands down the best one i have ever been too!!! three racks of designer jeans joes, citizens, rag & bone, paige just to name a few all priced $59-$79. found a clover canyon jacket that i didn't buy and now deeply regretting it can't find it anywhere online cheaper or in stock! crying!!! i want to go back and i bet it is not there now anyway. high end pieces their still pricey but are deeply discounted. big home area as well, the whole store was fully stocked and everything was neatly organized. supposed to be back in charlotte in 2 weeks you can bet i will be back!"
2-star,0,"before you judge me on my two stars, hear me out!!! the store was semi-disorganized and it made me feel chlosterphobic. i was there in search of sandals at a decent price. and when i say decent i mean under or right at $20 bucks. the shoes were displayed neatly but the boxes underneath them?? all over the place. some of the shoes were put back in the wrong spot. frustrating. i hate having to hunt for red october and locate items in random places. needless to say i was over hunting for shoes under $20. i moved on to slippers. found some for under $10. score! that makes up for the shoe fiasco. moved on to jean shorts and was immediately turned off by the disorganized clothing racks. i took my $7 slippers to the counter and checked out. i was over it by this time. maybe i should give myself 1 star and not the store. i just hate going in here because it's never really organzied and i find myself wanting to clean up instead of shopping. i have issues."
3-star,0,"i love marshalls but this location was just to cramp! i guess marshalls has to have a quota of items in every store or something but this location was had no elbow room. i also didn't find as many things as usual at this location. even though i love these stores and this one is located next to a lot of other great shops, i won't be back just because i got sick of saying excuse me fifty times while squeezing through the spaces between display racks."
5-star,1,"one of my top two favorite marshall's in charlotte. - carries higher end line if clothing - has more selections to choose from - conveniently located with or neat shops in the area like bath/body, ulta, books-a-million, harris teeter, etc..."
4-star,1,"insane amount of shoes, and good size selection as well! as far as marshall's go, if i'm looking for anything other than clothing, i choose this one. yes, they do have a small contemporary selection and some decent higher end denim options, a little bcbg, a little michael kors... but it seems like everyone knows this already, and for me everything after that little bubble was just boring. but, the shoes? holy crap. their boot selection rivals a shoe warehouse's and they have a ton of shoes on clearance. the home goods, awesome. a surprisingly large collection of cook books, have even found a fiction book i was planning on buying as a gift off amazon. i was actually surprised how many gourmet food items they have, and the selection of really nice kitchen wares (even most of the line from the palm restaurant). if you need a green olive stuffed with anything other than a pimento - you can find it at this marshall's! tons of kids toys, children's clothing, and a good selection of electronics accessories (ear buds, head phones, etc) as you check out. not much help as far as while you're shopping, but the cashiers are usually super friendly. it's clean, its nicely set up, and if you didn't prepare yourself to spend an hour sifting through the racks, there is a well kept bathroom in the back left corner."
4-star,1,"this is a great marshall's -- with everything from super ladies shoes to soaps to housewares and great clothes, this store has an awesome selection of everything! when the holidays roll around, this is a great place to search for great gifts for everyone on your list."
5-star,1,"let me say that i consider myself somewhat of a marshalls/tj maxx connoisseur. if i spend more than two hours in a store my roommate has the uncanny ability to know that i must be shopping at marshall's. this is the best location i have found, period. the clothes are a bit higher end as nicole mentioned, but all in great condition and really you can find something cute with minimum digging. my last trip i ended up with an italian-made sweater dress for fifty dollars, and a cynthia rowley shawl for thirty! it is also a great place to stock up on inexpensive basics - two pairs of betsy johnson tights for $10, $4 camisoles, $16 knit scarves, yes please! tons of shoes for you collectors out there too! one of my favorite things about this store is that they carry a huge selection of higher-end beauty products. joico, wella, body shop, wildaid, nexus, clinique etc.. they also have fantastic deals on specialty food items, pots and pans (discounted calphalon), and other home-wares. plus easy parking, ulta and petsmart right next-door!"
5-star,1,i have never been a fan of marshall's or tj maxx until this one changed my mind. amazing merchandise. even carries niche fashion brands that are hard to find in the qc even at southpark. big fan.
4-star,1,"i love to shop, but even i can get a bit overwhelmed with the discount retailers and their racks and racks of unorganized clothing. but i do love a deal, so i always try a discount retailer at least once before crossing them off the list. i happen to live in the cotswold area and love this marshall's. it's clean, has a crazy ton of great shoes (my weakness), and is pretty well organized in terms of these type of stores. the clothing selection is always well stocked, and this is my first stop if i'm looking for great workout clothes on the cheap. i've purchased nike, adidas, under armour and puma gear here. i've noticed (but have yet to purchase), multiple top name designer clothing items as well. i've also picked up a great yoga mat, gifts for my friends kids and my nephew (great selection of hard cover books for much cheaper than retail prices), packets of cards for the notes i like to send, and even a duvet set and sheets for our spare bedroom. the kitchen section has a great selection of pots and pans, as well as other miscellaneous kitchen items that you didn't even know existed (which, of course, you immediately must have). there are always a ton of cashiers on hand, so even if the line looks long, it'll be a short wait. ultimately, for a last minute gift or just to peruse what's available, this marshall's is a great bet if you're on a budget."
4-star,1,"in the world of copious ""dress for less"" stores, i.e. ross, marshall's tj maxx, etc. this particular store and location is one of my faves. why oh why is this marshall's so spectacular? well, let me count the ways: -tons and tons of designer jeans. i'm a total jean fanatic so this can present a problem and a solution if you know what i mean. i've seen rock and republic, joe's, sevens, citizens, etc. they aren't super, super cheap but at least 50% off their original (insane) prices. -the most amazing shoe offerings i've ever seen at a marshall's. it's a vast collection and i've seen some swank-ay designers within here - i'm talking prada and d&g. for realz. -a pretty decent selection of workout gear and clothing. tons 'o under armour and some nike. there are also plenty of clothes and shoes for the dudes and the kiddos, just make sure you schedule enough time to look around! happy shopping, to all!"
5-star,1,"i love this marshalls!! clean, organized and a great selection of stuff... i go into marshall's or tj maxx to just look for different or unique things and usually always find it."
3-star,0,"selection in all sections of the store were sparse. i found a pair of shoes i liked but as i looked closer the heel wedges had dirt the shoe beds had dirt on them and a major metal embellishment was partially broken off the top part of the shoe which was glaring noticeable. they had been marked down in price but with all the mars the price was too high in my opinion. the shoes were cute so i put them in my cart. there weren't many items i was attracted to. after about an hour i did find a cute dress on sale for $9.99 - score! i took my items to check out. i reviewed the shoes with all it's issues with the cashier which to me were most likely unsellable and asked if they would reduce the price at all. the sales associate looked over the shoes and said she'd take off 10%. in my opinion that was beyond a ridiculous offer. i declined and did not buy the shoes. the place was clean. the sales associate i spoke with, asked questions and checked out with was very nice and polite. i don't know if i would go back there with the less than desirable selection. i understand one has to spend time and look through many items to possibly find something in these type of discount stores. i don't know if i want to take the time here. i prefer ross. unfortunately they don't have them around here. one last note. there was a teenage girl with her mom trying on shoes while i was looking at shoes. while mom was looking in another aisle i asked her what she thought about a pair of sneakers i was trying on she nodded yes and said her best friend had a pair. she took off the pair of heels she had on as her mom went to another aisle as i was taking off the sneakers i looked over and she had tried on another pair of heels, black bootie type with peep toe and tassle, so cute and looked great on her. i told her how cute they were and those were the ones! she went to show her mom and said she loved them but would have to change her whole outfit. ah the things we do for the cute, perfect have to have shoes"
2-star,0,will never return to this location wow really what a complete joke and of course no privacy. the bathrooms stalls had no doors in the men's bathroom. its real sad i hope it was not this way in the ladies bathroom. but something needs to be done. i am shocked management would not close the stall down or something. what is a handicap wheel chair person suppose to if he needs to go to the bathroom... i spendt 15 minutes walking around trying to find a manager or employee about this matter and not one employee was around that can help me. do not return to this store....
4-star,1,this place is a little gem. i took my grand daughter shopping for school clothes. she is 16 and was able to find a lot of styles she loved. i shopped as well but found they did not have as large a selection in my bigger size. prices were really reasonable and there was a lot to look at. i had only stopped there once before briefly but will definitely go back.
3-star,0,"i like marshalls because they sometimes have very good branded stuff for very low prices. this particular store is nice but not as organized as others i have been to in the past. i like their location and proximity to some of the grocery places i frequently visit. i could not find what i was looking for here and that might be just co incidence. now that i am thinking about it, i have never found anything interesting at this store during my many past visits. there has to be something good about this place that attracts me here every now and then."
4-star,1,"so, my dogs ate my sandles this morning anx i needed to wear my boots. i did look pretty silly in shorts and a pair of boots. so, i walked in and went straight for the sandles. found so many pairs that i wanted and ultimately settled on a pair of yoga slings. i'm obsessed with this brand. so much cheaper at marshals. i got two pairs. the store was packed but, very clean and the check out lines moved very quickly. i'll definitely go back."
4-star,1,"other than the fact that this marshalls is a little on the smaller side, the store is very nice and in typical fashion, aplomb with great discounts . love the clearance section and the fact that it is lever super crowded- like some of the other stores in the area."
5-star,1,my favorite place for clothes and goodies. best brands and best prices. they actually have an awesome beauty section with a lot of cool and unique items. tip: get the tjx card for coupons every time you shop.
4-star,1,"love marshalls!!!!! such affordable clothing and you can find everythig from abercrombe to polo, shoot i even found armani that got snapped up faster than the speed of light!!! if you are a bit of a cothes horse such as mself marshalls/tj maxx is the place!!!!!!"
4-star,1,"am i turning into a girl or what? i like to think my masculinity is intact, but after the following admission, i may have to re-evaluate: there are definitely worse ways than spending your lunch hour bumming around marshall's. the whole vibe of the place is an upscale big lots, but thankfully without the sketchy food items. there are pretty cool deals on clothing, but if you're a dude like me, you'll mainly check out the sales on electronic crap and (even though i'm 31) the toy section. they also have a great selection of random tchotchkes, so if you want a set of doberman-shaped salt-and-pepper shakers, you know where to go."
5-star,1,quick and done right. she took an inch off of the hem of my jeans and you can't tell they've been altered (which is what i wanted). the price was reasonable and they were done on the date promised. hours of operation are convenient.
1-star,0,"daughter took wedding gown to be cleaned and preserved. when we picked it up, it was just folded up and put in a box. so disappointed."
5-star,1,"my daughters alterations were perfect! prom dress fits like glove! so happy. i finally have found alterations business who take pride in their work, attention to detail is phenomenal. we will be back."
5-star,1,"if i could, i'd give this place a 10-star rating! i've had a number of things altered here! they have also altered (let out) a suit for my husband, & changed the hem on a formal for my daughter in college. the price is always very reasonable & i have never had to ask for speedy delivery; the work is always completed in such a short amount of time. the prices here are so good, that i have even brought shorts & jeans up to be hemmed! she can do anything! i needed my full length, lined london fog coat to be shortened due to moth damage. when i got my coat back, one would have never known it had been altered. this was a huge savings, as it kept me from having to buy a new coat! bravo!!!"
5-star,1,"i have used matthews alterations for several years now. i am always very pleased with the service. i have been sewing of over 40 years and could do my own alterations, but don't really have the time. the cost of getting them done here is very reasonable. my alterations are always done perfectly. the owner is an expert in what she does. she has suggested additional alterations to a few of my garments that have made them look custom made. she completes the work in just a few days. i highly recommend this alteration shop."
5-star,1,"laura is great with alterations! i have gotten jeans hemmed, a dress with boning taken in, and a silk tweed suit hemmed and taken in. everything she's ever taken in for me has fit perfectly. i'm getting married in a few weeks, and after getting frustrated with the limited availability, projected number of fittings, and projected cost at the bridal salon where i bought my dress, decided to go to laura. i live out of town, and she was very considerate of my limited availability. i think i called on a friday, and she told me to come in any time the next day. she pinned my dress up in about ten minutes, and told me to come back in two weeks. my dress is trumpet with lace overlay. she took in the sides, cut down the train, hemmed the bottom, and added a bustle--for half what it as supposed to cost at the bridal salon. also, she did a great job. the hemming involved removing lace overlay, cutting down the length of the dress, replacing the lace overlay, and hemming all the underlayers. for the bustles, she put in several ties and paid attention to making sure it worked with the flow of the dress. she also made sure the bustles fell so that they would not show the underlayers of the dress. people talk about going in for multiple fittings, but with laura it was one and done. it took a lot of stress off of me to not have to worry about it, and i felt a lot of pride at not getting suckered by the bridal shop with its high cost, three fittings, and appointments that have to be made weeks in advance. i would highly recommend laura to any bride!"
1-star,0,"we had the worst experience with this place! my husband's alterations were dropped off and paid on july 2013, additional alternations were needed, and therefore he left his suits to be picked up on a later date. first trip: my husband works abroad, therefore i went to pick up the alterations on august 2013, with a receipt marked paid. the lady (owner) stated the alternations were not paid and refused to relinquish my husband suits, even with the receipt marked paid. her theory: if the other two carbon receipts were not marked paid, the transaction did not occur. second trip: my husband was very adamant about the fact that he paid and he reassured me. i went back to the shop and asked if she could research her records plus the receipt was marked paid. she refused to relinquish the suits; she was very rude and basically ignored me. third trip: now, i am second-guessing my husband, because this is asinine. however my husband has a great memory and he deals with numbers all day therefore i attempted to visit the shop again. she still refused to relinquish the suits. i asked again if she could ""please"" check her financial records, check the register...anything... i just want to pick up my husband suits. still no suits...my husband spent some time checking our bank statements and there was a payment of $114.00 made on july 5, 2013 with a reference number from matthews alterations. my husband immediately called the owner, she told him, the police had his suits. i called the lady and stated we had proof we paid and i can swing by and bring our statement...she immediately cut me off and said she was going to call the police and that his suits were at the police station. she also mentioned we didn't want to pay for the suits we just wanted a free service. after the phone call, i had a police officer call me and asked if i could meet him at the shop. i arrive at the shop and there were two squad cars. i showed the police proof of payment as well as well as the owner. she then tried to say my bank statement wasn't real, wanted to copy my bank statement (which is illegal) and just because the word ""paid"" was not written on her calendar marked july 5th the payment was not real. the police officer had to reassure her the bank statement was legit. long story longer...the look of total humiliation on her face was indeed priceless. at each attempt, my husband and i were never disrespectful, and kept every visit professional. she was very rude, unprofessional, voided my existence, and lied about the suits being at the police station. her bookkeeping is antiquated and suspicious and the shop is filthy! this could have been resolved in a timely manner, saving me gas, my time, and wasted tax dollars for calling matthews police department if she just would have provided me with customer service 101 by researching her financials. she needs to be audited by the irs!"
5-star,1,"why does this place not have enough reviews?? i just have to rave a little bit about the service and great work this place does for alterations. i went on a whim on blanka's review below... bought a super expensive wedding gown, so i was a little hesitant taking it to a local (non-bridal) place for alterations for my wedding gown. laura couldn't have done any better...i had her do a bustle, bust adjustment, hemming, and she did a great job at a very reasonable price. it probably would have cost me a lot more if i took it to a bridal boutique for alterations. don't hesitate to try matthews alterations & cleaners :-) :-)"
5-star,1,"i would like to first make note of my five star rating. i am not easily pleased as i truly believe and feel that businesses have to do what they are there to do which is please the customer (as long as the customer is not an ignorant individual trying to give them a hard time, i commend those who are still good with these people as well. now to the review: i was the matron of honor in a friend's wedding on march 9, 2013 in dallas, tx and my husband and i are new to charlotte, nc so we have to start all over to find a cleaners, tailor, doctors, etc.. (you get the point). my dress was ""custom"" from a boutique in dallas, tx where they made the dress according to your measurements which mine are very unnormal 36-26-42. the dress was $275 with shipping and when it arrived it smothered me (they sent a size 16 and i have never worn a 16 in my life). i went to seven - yes seven tailors in and around charlotte and was told that the dress had to be taken apart and put back together in order to fit me because they needed to take about 16 inches from the dress from different areas in order for the dress to fit my original coca cola bottle figure and the cost would range from $225-$300 which would put this horrible dress in the price range of $500 - $600. my last and final stop was to matthews alterations & cleaners (my husband suggested we try them because we see the place every time we go to costco). i didn't express to them the price i had been given at the seven other alteration shops i just tried it on and spoke on the horror the dress is causing. laura tran was so funny, nice and understanding. she laughed with me when i put the dress on and it fell to the floor when i stop holding it up. she put pins everywhere and told me to come back next week which i did and tried it on again, it had to be worked on again and i came back the third time and you would have never thought it was the same dress it was absolutely perfect and after all that work i didn't care how much it cost and overall it only cost me $60 i could not believe it. i gave her a $40 tip because i just couldn't believe that she took my dress apart and put it back together so perfectly and humbly and was so nice to me and my family in the process. this is my family new alteration shop definitely!!!!"
5-star,1,"great service on alterations! very good with their dry clean service also. services are at fair price, i've been going to this shop for several years now and have referred a lot of my friends here!"

5-star,1,"i am writing this review based on customer service. maria zaldana helped me in the process of selecting a beautiful ring. i must say, she exhibited top customer service and professionalism. i believe in my heart she was honest and gave me a fair deal on my ring........mtf maria and the ring are a winner ! thanks maria !!"
4-star,1,"i went in today to get rid of a few things i had in the back of my closet. upon entering i was greeted by all the staff there. steve was the rep that help me with my transaction. he was very personable, knowledgeable and professional. he walked me through all the steps, and advised me how much i would be getting. if you want to be treated fairly make your way down there. if i have anything else i want to get rid of, i will bring it to steve."
1-star,0,"i purchased a coach purse here after hearing great things about max pawn, hearing them on the radio and a lot of other things. they did give me the yelp discount. i went to la and the coach store the next week. at that store i was informed the purse was a fake. this surprised me greatly, i really liked the purse. so i had to drive the 45 minutes from my home in henderson to come up there. yes they did refund my money, but not my time nor an apology from them. i was shocked and upset, they basically said it is a so what someone got one over on them."
1-star,0,"do not trust anything that they say, any advertisements that they put out. they lie and they will not honor their word! watch out for this place. they act nice and then they lie to you!"
5-star,1,max pawn is very unique pawnshop it's nothing like your normal average pawnshop they go over and beyond to find you anything you can imagine.dawn at max pawn will literally find you anything you can want from the watch you have always wanted but didn't think you could afford to the purse your wife always wanted .they have a great layaway program . and if your ever short on cash they will give you a loan on almost anything .michal will always greet you with a smile as all of his staff will.
5-star,1,i have been too a few shops in the valley.this shop by far offers the best amount for items you are trying to sell. very good customer service overall great experience.
5-star,1,"friendliest staff ever. variety of merchandise is amazing. got a small loan and they waived the interest for the first 30 days. far from where i live, but i'll definitely be back."
1-star,0,"wanted to sell a few items without hassling with ebay so i decided to give this place a chance. walked in and had my items appraised by an older, odd looking guy. i brought in a certina italian divers watch and this he began ""appraising"" it. first, this person had no idea what he was doing, he said the watch is not working because the seconds hand would skip(as anyone who knows anything about fine watches knows, this is just a sign that the battery is low) but this guy had no clue and just said the watch is ""broken"". next item, a longines dolce vita men's watch, which sells on ebay for 600-800 dollars(pre owned). he looks at it and offers me 80 dollars. that's when i knew this place was a waste of time. this ""appraiser"" not only looked slow but also was clueless and slimey. this is not a legitimate, honest business. seedy and dishonest is all i have to say."
5-star,1,i was just their today. james and maria are excellent . they help me with my rmerchandise. i bought micheal kors purse and 2mk watch. .love it and i will be back . i look them up on line and check them out . .love the place.. they gave the best offer. highly recommended . i'm happy . i'll buy more and will ck on -line since they are really so nice and excellent merchandise .must go. thanks again liliag
1-star,0,"heymichael mack, its business, i just wan ti be fair, with this happened, i feel i i lost about $200, if you give me refund, you dont have to be sorry,"
5-star,1,"i just moved here from california and wanted to get rid of some items. steve helped me out without any issues. i had my grandfathers handgun that had been sitting in a box for i don't know how long. understandably, the firearm was too damaged for them to buy and resell. but, there was another man there who was interested in taking it off my hands to restore it for his own personal enjoyment, and that made me feel good. although i don't know anything about guns, since it was my grandfathers it was kind of sentimental to me. i don't like to keep things laying around, especially a gun that i will never use.. so i'm happy that it went to someone who can get something out of it. thank you steve and max pawn for making the experience good! i wil def be back!"
1-star,0,i came to get a price for my lv wallet but they pass on it because they said something about the serial number too small they mentioned that if i have the receipt for it they could probably match the numbers and since i know the receipt of that wallet and another purse are actually in pawn with them i ask them to go and get it for me but i guess they just don't feel like goin back and get it i don't know if is because is saturday and they just don't want to give that xtra help.they said that i needed it to pick up the purse in order to get location of it... what a bssh***. thank you to the redhead and curly spanic girl managers on duty that day. ( oh by the way the black lady that was helping me question why i don't take the wallet to the pawnshop i work?) like really!! maybe because sometimes i'm lucky and find good help with maxpawn!!
5-star,1,"i have never had such a wonderful experience buying purse for my wife. ydo was a tremendous help and is much appreciated. ydo, you are reason enough to visit the store again. thanks a bunch!"
5-star,1,i love this place tanya and phill are the best they always get me the best deals and always let me know when they have the best shoes as well!
5-star,1,went into max pawn looking for a few things and was greeted right away by jay who was very helpful and friendly. i'll definitely shop here again!
5-star,1,"very trusted seller. i just purchased a lv bag on tradsey website, and i'm happy with my purchased. well describe and easy to communicate with. will do business with max pawn again. highly recommended!!!!!"
5-star,1,"i looooooooove this place! simply the best shopping in all of las vegas!! i have never received customer service like this before. the quality is top notch! i buy designer bags from all over the world, once i discovered this place/ it all stopped. carmen, james, steve and michael (the whole staff) is the most caring and considerate to your buying needs."
5-star,1,"this was one of the most wonderful shopping experiences i had! the first thing i noticed what the top quality products displayed all throughout the shop. there were a variety of designer brands and valuable merchandise visible in display cases and all over the walls, from chanel and louis vuitton bags to autographed photos of john lennon and elvis presley to playstation and nintendo wii. i wasn't quite sure what i wanted to get when i initially came in but so many things caught my attention right away. i'm not one who likes to spend a long time shopping but i could've stayed till closing. the amount of care put into max pawn is apparent and the customer service matches the care put into the store and the many customers it attracts. all the store associates had positive attitudes and were eager to help. ivan answered any questions i had, handled my purchases (a certified, framed genuine animated cel of the disney movie dumbo from the early 1940s and rayban glasses with a case), and wrapped them safe and securely for my car ride back home to l.a. michael mack was front and center and greeted his customers personally; he takes pride in his shop and strives to make all his customers happy. the whole staff reflects this attitude as well which leaves a collective positive vibe. and of course, the deals were unbelievable! good luck trying to find better deals on designer brands than max pawn. everything is certified to be authentic and is top quality. literally everybody was happy with what they were purchasing to the point where people were screaming with joy. one woman actually danced out of the store! i'm very pleased with my purchases (i couldn't help myself, i had to purchase more than one thing!) and would definitely come back! see you guys next time when i go to vegas again!"
5-star,1,"great experience with max pawn. i went in to sell some jewelry. they had a machine that figures out the metal content, and they weigh and quote a price right in front of you. very efficient and upfront. i also found the staff friendly, and felt no pressure to sell. the price was right, however, so i did sell and would come to them again. thanks to jerry, who was wonderful!"
5-star,1,"phillip is wonderful. very professional and helpful. i brought in a lot of unwanted items and he gave me fair price for each one. i even brought in a 10 year old ""vintage"" gucci purse that belongs in the garbage but phillip still took the time to appraise it and was very polite in the decline. the owner is a great help too. you can text him pictures of items and he gets back to you asap on ballpark price. no run around, no low balling, and beautiful items for sale. i won't ever pay full price for chanel or louis vuitton again, they have a huge inventory of luxury items in perfect condition. thanks for the help phillip, pleasure doing business with you."
1-star,0,"i tried selling a couple of my louis vuitton pieces here and have gotten low balled each time. to the point of walking out offended. i understand that they need to make a profit but offering me pennies for a purse that cost thousands; in which, they are also selling for thousands, is ridiculous. if you're looking to sell a designer purse, i believe you're better off selling it to an online consignment shop. save your gas and your time."
5-star,1,if you were looking for lv chanel or gucci come stop by and check it out. this place very clean and staff was very nice and helpful. i sell my lv wallet here. maria gave me a great prices. im definitely be back again not for sell but for shopping lol. if you wanna buy any luxury purses or handbag (lv chanel gucci or even hermes) this place is good before you go buy full price in the strip. it not brand new but it good deal no fake and clean
5-star,1,max pawn is great!!!..i love their collection of purses and great prices!!!...laura perez was very helpful and knowledgable!!!...will definitely shop here again!!
5-star,1,came in here this afternoon to sell a nixon 51-30 watch and beats headphones. got a very fair price and our transaction was handled quickly and professionally by ray. i would recommend this place to anyone i know. also had a great selection of luxury items. the shop is brand new and very clean. great experience all around.
5-star,1,i have been here a few times and i love their jewelry and high end accessories collection. they're very classy and know how to pick what they can sell. they really work with you when it comes to their layaway and pricing. all of the employees have real great personalities. have i mentioned they have layaways on hermes birkins???
5-star,1,this place is great! steve gave us excellent service.. i didn't know this little gem existed with all the high end good quality bags etc. thanks guys!
5-star,1,"i have just purchased several great handbags from max pawn. the gentleman handling my transaction was steve. this man understands great personal customer service. every part of my transaction was smooth, and easy. since i live in los angeles, i was extra surprised at how attentive steve was to my sale. my handbags were at my door within days, wrapped with care. the purses are great! it was extra nice to speak to a nice person who knew his product. thanks max pawn!"
1-star,0,"my husband is a long time client of mephisto shoes but this store displayed the type of service that discourages a customer from buying shoes. when trying to compare styles, the very rude sales associate asked my husband not to remove shoes from the shelf because it was easier for her to keep track of the shoes. also, when my husband tried on a pair, he was accused of creasing the shoe. my husband is very patient and literally had to advocate for himself to get a pair of shoes with very little help from this particular salesperson. i had to leave the store because she disgusted me. worst service i've ever encountered."
1-star,0,"i agree with angela n, this store lacks decent customer service. the couple (male and female) seem to only like serving caucasian customer, if you are not one of them, forget about getting any service, i browsed patiently while they serve caucasian customers but even after they finished with them, the couple did not bother asking me whether i needed help. they could see that i was in the store trying shoes on, in the end i had to go up to the female sales person but just like the treatment angela received, i also got the same treatment, this is so uncalled for, have they not heard of customer service ? i noticed that they are exceptionally nice to anyone who is caucasian and especially men. they obviously don't want business from other customers even though non-caucasian customers have money to pay too."
5-star,1,this is a fantastic store! i'm on my feet all day and travelling a lot for work so a friend of mine in montreal reccomended i try mephisto's. i bought their version of the boat shoe and i wear it to death! it's amazing for travel and the leather molded to my foot so it's a perfect fit. the customer service is also really good in this store. they know exactly what they are talking about and they even told me how to wear the shoe in. it also came with a warantee which i haven't had to use yet but its good to know that its available!
1-star,0,"i love mephisto brand a lot: i buy mephisto shoes every time i travel to europe. mephisto shoes are elegant, comfortable, and long lasting. i have shoes that are 4-5 years old and they are still in a very good condition. and i live in canada where the amount of salt on street can kill your shoes in a week. unfortunately, this store falls short on two levels: first, the styles are quite limited. second, even if you find the style you like, there is a 99% chance that they will not have your size. especially, if you wear the most common size 8. as a result, i end up buying mephisto shoes on ebay or elsewhere. very disappointing."
4-star,1,open sundays and offers a high level of customer service if you shop during the week they are expensive but very well made and will last a long time
5-star,1,"each time my wife or i visit mephisto in rosedale we really enjoy the selection and experience in general. we've found the staff the be very helpful and accommodating. the shoes have, over time, greatly helped alleviate my wife's plantar fasciitis. they're also the only shoes i trust when i know i'm going to be walking a significant distance in the city."
2-star,0,"how does metropark inventory work? when we came in, we saw a sign that announced that the store was closing for good in two days. is it then reasonable for one to expect really, really cheap prices? perhaps if this was a ""normal"" store. i saw a cute dress that i really wanted up until i saw the $70 tag. pass!"
1-star,0,out of all the metro park stores ive been including the ones in vegas this was probably the worse one ive been too. the workers looked miserable to be there and yeah thats all
5-star,1,this is my new favorite clothing store! the prices are a little steep but the fashion is unique and fits my very picky taste! the staff is helpful and there are always a good amount of sale items! now if there was only one in sacramento!
5-star,1,"i can't believe no one has reviewed this place....i had the best shopping experience here and spent more on one shopping trip than i ever had in my life--but that's a good thing. as i window-shopped at the miracle mile, i spotted metropark (which i'd never been in before) and thought i'd continue to window-shop. james asked me if i needed help and what style i like...he started a room for me and gave me clothes to try on. i normally wouldn't have picked out most of the pieces he gave me, like the true religion jeans, and the frankie b. cut-offs, but i loved 99% of his suggestions and did not end up buying half of my picks. what i'm trying to say is i don't know how to dress, but james knows what's best for me!"
4-star,1,"one star for having the most random yet super cute goodies that did not break my pocketbook (and of course, lots of other ones that would have, for me to just moon over...) one star for rockin' the boombastic 'icanthearyou' music that encourages you to continue quickly piling things into your arms since you are unable to carry on any sort of conversation with the gal pal who accompanied you into the store. one star for the cute punked out little sales chick who...while she did not think i was a size small, definitely agreed i was a medium...and was super helpful about not pointing out that i was probably 10 years too old to be shopping in there. one star for the sale rack, where i managed to find not one, but two super cute tops... one of which i have already worn and gotten rave reviews from the coworkers on. gotta love the sales. before this visit i'd only heard about metropark in mags accompanied by bright photos of crazy ass looking jeans....or in random convos i'd catch snatches of. now i have seen those funky rhinestone covered jeans in person and i just gotta say...who wears those???? btw this place is in the miracle mile mall. which is ... not a mile...but certainly fun to shop in."
5-star,1,"this place is like walking back in time. kind of expertise and service of days past. massive selection of hats for all styles and sizes. what i was really interested in was a repair. ray was able to stretch my hat to size and fix the band in ten minutes time. these guys are true craftsman, glad to see these types of tradesmen still exist. note - their storefront is a bit hard to find, it's actually wrapped around to the side of the building. well worth the trip. will def be back."
5-star,1,"i have been going to mike the hatter since the 1980's when they were in downtown cleveland. going to the store is a pleasure in itself. fair prices, great selection of quality merchandise, and six stars out of five for the customer service!"
5-star,1,i was in cleveland on vacation and found this place by accident and marlon (mike) answered the phone when i called and gave me directions and took excellent care of me-i left a very happy customer with my hat that i wanted and great prices-marlon will get you exactly what you want-diamond
1-star,0,"worst experience ever! i've been investing in and wearing top of the line dress hats for 30 years. so my wife ordered a hat from here as a christmas gift for me and the nightmare began! the hat came slightly bent out of shape but the packaging was intact so i called on tuesday the 22nd and spoke to one of the guys and he proceeded to tell me that the hat was ""good"" when they shipped it and became argumentative. he was rude and arrogant like it's impossible for them to make a mistake so i was done with him. i asked to speak with a manager and spoke to marlon. he assured me that he is a hat connoisseur and they're the best in the midwest. i told him that his employee was disrespectful and the hat was bent and too small. he apologized and assured me that he would get a new one, stretch it to my size, expedite shipping on friday the 26th and refund the return shipping cost as soon as we emailed him the receipt. we shipped the hat the same day and emailed him the receipt and tracking #. i called them repeatedly for tracking number for new hat and confirmation of refund but got the run around, ""leave us a call back#"" no call. i called again, ""the girl that does the numbers us not in, i'll text her and call you back"" no call. after i called them yet again they finally gave me a tracking# but for a package already delivered somewhere in ohio, i'm in california. i called back on monday the 28th, they gave me the right tracking# and said they received the return. fishy, i'll get to that. i finally get the new ""stretched"" hat and it has the bend in the exact same spot! coincidence? the hat still did not fit because it has a flexible wire band internally (to adjust the brim) around the entire hat that doesn't stretch as it doesn't allow the felt material to stretch. he knew that all along because i called yet again and told him it still doesn't fit and he said ""yeah the wire band doesn't stretch much."" it doesn't stretch at all. shady! my wife investigated the ship dates and found that they shipped the second hat on tuesday the 29th a day after they received the return when he promised me he would ship it as soon as we emailed him confirmation of return. liar! needless to say that it's taken over 2 weeks for them to process the return shipping reimbursement and they just processed it today for an amount less than the invoice states. jeez! what an experience. these guys have no integrity and no class. waste of time. i usually shop online at hats plus in chicago, excellent service! marlon the manager tried to trick me with the same hat i sent back. i'm sending the faulty, defective, not stretched hat back and we'll see how long it'll take for them to refund our money"
5-star,1,"great customer service. went in, got shown the exact hat style i was looking for, and left as a very satisfied customer with a cool new hat."
5-star,1,"the manager, james, helped me tremendously. i have a xxl hat size so it's hard to get anything cool but i left mike the hatter's with 2 great hats. james rolled the brim on one more for me and steamed another one a bit larger for a perfect fit. huge selection, good prices, and great customer service."
5-star,1,"where to begin?! i was looking for a distressed top hat. i found 2 online but couldn't decide which to order and both were small for me. so i began my online search for a company that could possibly stretch either hat. it was then that i found ""mike the hatter"". i called with 101 questions, everything from the amount of stretching they could do on a hat, how much it would cost, the turn around time, the shipping cost and even their opinion on which hat they thought was the best find! can you believe it? he said sure send me the 2 pictures and i'll give you my opinion! talk about customer service! marlon (mike) was the most pleasant person to work with. i live in san diego but if i ever was in the area i would definitely drop in to meet the guy! i can't begin to say enough about my experience!"
5-star,1,"outstanding work. my fedora was structurally sound but very, very dirty. i thought it maybe could get clean enough so that a person with mediocre vision wouldn't notice the stains in artificial light. they got the hat completely clean, so that it actually looks new (even in sunlight). took about two weeks or so, including time on its way to and fro. not cheap, but an excellent price/value ratio imho."
5-star,1,i worked with james on having him clean my favorite hat. james was very helpful and responsive . my hat came back better than ever and even smelled nice as well . i will be using there service again the future.
4-star,1,"ive had my tweed flat cap for almost four years now and over that time it had built up a substantial amount of grime and smoke damage so i figured it was way over due for a cleaning. these guys did good, the cap looks practically new and had no signs of any shrinkage. the shop probably has one of the better hat selections around and the prices arnt bad. if youre looking for a different hat id say check them out, just call to find out if they are still in downtown cleveland as they are about to move."
5-star,1,great stylist. michelle is the best. she always takes an amazing amount of time. i've been coming here for a year. great salon.
5-star,1,it was my first time at mosaic. salon looked clean and welcoming. my friend recommended crystal ghassedi and i absolutely do not regret trying her out. she provides not only excellent service but also builds personal relationship with her clients. safe to say i'm completely satisfied with her services and definitely will be back!!
5-star,1,"came to mosaic salon to get highlights done and was serviced by tam dao. he did an amazing job, was very understanding and knowledgeable as to what i wanted and helped me decide when i was in doubt. i'm so happy with the results!"
5-star,1,"got my hair done last friday for my baby shower and it came out better than i anticipated! i have been dying my hair black for over 5 years and have had the worst trouble changing the color! i've tried ombré twice and the places i went just damaged my hair and left me cutting so much of my hair as well! i did a balayage and it looks great! defiantly will need one more session to really get the color i want but overall i'm very please my hair is still long and healthy couldn't of asked for a better job! desaray did my hair and she's lovely! very good price the place is wonderful when you walk in all the girls are very sweet too! just a very welcoming, clean & beautiful environment! i will be back very soon!!"
5-star,1,ciera did a better job on my hair than anyone else ever has. she actually listened to me! my number one fear is walking out and my hair looking totally different two weeks later. ciera literally texted me to check in and make sure i was still happy with my results. and i am!!!! for the first time my hair is colored evenly and exactly the tones i wanted and it's been about a month with no fading :) such a sweet heart. so glad i found her!!!!! she really cares!
5-star,1,"ciera u are my queen seriously my hair looked like a year old mop and now i have this stunning art on my head thanks to miss ciera. the salon is awesome, very elegant. ciera is the sweetest and kept every minute of the 7 hours i spent with her entertaining. also fair pricing."
5-star,1,"i love my new haircut. i followed beth raskin on ig (@weubly) for a long time before making an appointment for just a cut. i have several problem-hair issues including that i am in the process of growing out severe damage/breakage. she was very patient and knowledgeable when discussing my options. her assistant, michelle, is also very nice and gave me a good massage/wash. i have not felt this good about my hair in a long time. thanks so much, beth and michelle!"
5-star,1,"tam dao is amazing! i got my hair done feb 18th w tam at this salon and i couldn't be more happier w my results! i have a girlfriend that has been going to him for a few years now and i've always loved her hair and i myself have been wanting to go lighter. so i finally did and let me tell you, it was everything i expected it to be! (in a good way) he really delivered the results i wanted, i've never gone lighter so i was so nervous yet excited and he's really made me fall in love with my hair! he tells you exactly what he's doing before he does it and i love that. i recommended him! i would go back if i decide to go lighter :)"
5-star,1,"i was looking for a new salon and i was lucky enough to be scheduled with cori. she listened to what i wanted for my hair. going to a new salon is nerve racking bc even though your hair will grow back you still don't want to walk around with a messed up hair do for months. recently i just had 5 inches chopped off and colored and highlighted - she did an amazing job!! people are still telling me what a great job she did a month and a half later! love the salon it is always and clean and welcoming, i have never had a problem scheduling an appointment with cori - im a spur of the momement type person when it comes to wanting my hair done and she has always been able to squeeze me in."
1-star,0,"it's not about how clean or how salon looks. it's about customer service something that is priceless. yet i'm very unhappy with kirsten whom scheduled an appointment with and did not follow through yet she must learn that you don't just set an appt with a client then you wash your hands and say i can't do your hair because you have extensions. totally rude! she never made the effort to really work with me. she knew from the beginning i had extentions, yet she just brushed me under the carpet and didn't apply professional and customer service. the fact that she thought that i was going to take this lightly and not complain . you are defenitely not a professional yet unclassy, and uncustomer service. don't trust her she doesn't follow through. she is not credible!"
5-star,1,awesome salon! very clean and has an adorable little boutique in the front of the shop. love my stylist here! everyone here is super friendly and talented- you won't be disappointed!
5-star,1,"trina is my stylist, and i've been going to her for three years. they say that the good stylists always group together. i've always had a great cut/highlight, with great results. my style's ranged from a bob to long, and its always gorgeous out of the salon. she keeps in mind that i'm low-mainentance, and cuts around my laziness."
1-star,0,"for as much as i love shopping at my sister's stores this one has to be the worst, many of the employees here are less than friendly and have little to no customer service skills. don't even think about asking the ladies at the intake counter about any of the items pending pricing. the best they can do is repeatedly comment on what they don't know. no offers to take a number just again and again we don't know. how many times do they need to repeat. when i asked ""is that the best she could do, couldn't you offer to take my number and call"". she returned ""i was getting to that. ""realy, i could hardly tell. i guess i did't present myself as someone worth giving service to. my last visit wasn't the first time i experience poor unfriendly service at this location and from the same people. honestly they act in a manner that is unacceptable. i will not tolerate being treated in this manner."
1-star,0,"i used to really like these stores but lately i have been really disappointed. if you take stuff into sell they tell me it must be no older than 5 years old and worth more than $50 however, the store is like 90% stuff that is definitely older than 5 years old!!! i then took in a table that i had only had for a year and they put such a low price on it that it wasn't even worth my trouble to take it over here. the same goes for the clothing stores, they act like your stuff is dirt and deny it but then you see stuff all over the store that is much cheaper brands than what you were trying to consign. they are really shady. if you want to take in gucci that you paid $500 for and are okay in getting $50 for it, this is the place for you."
5-star,1,"the best consignment store in the valley! the staff is so friendly and helpful. i had to laugh at the reviewer who called the manager, tom a ""crab""- he is anything but that! given the amount of merchandise that moves through this store on a daily basis i think he does an amazing job. as anywhere, i find that if you are a nice person...people are nice back!!"
2-star,0,"the manager of this store, tom, is a crab. it is easy to see that he does not enjoy his job. the other employees that work at n. scottsdale store are all so nice, but i will not shop or consign here again."
5-star,1,"i love, love, love this place. i am a huge fan. they have amazing finds, great prices and their customer service is five star. christine is so nice, a true pleasure to deal with. i know i will be making many more purchases here. this store is a gem. sooo glad i found them. i am totally addicted to their website also, a small teaser of all they have to offer. ask for christime, and happy shopping!"
1-star,0,"extremely disappointed and would not recommend consigning fairly new and nice furniture items.. i brought in 3 pieces of furniture that were purchased within a 2 year time period and were still in the store catalogs. i gave them the receipts and they had priced them less than 1/2 of what they were purchased for and that was okay, but what disturbed me was, they were marked down within 2 weeks of being in the store and i was told that they had a lot of interest and it was priced to high. the two desirable pieces sold as soon as they were marked down and the 3rd piece which was less desirable was never marked down ???. i still can't figure that one out. when i questioned the man on the floor, his response was we need to price that down too. very arrogant attitude and i learned my lesson the hard way. there are many consignment stores out there and they wait 60 days before they mark down an item and you split the purchase 50/50. if it's a nice item, i'd go else where.."
5-star,1,"my favorite consignment store, hands down. it does get a little overstuffed in here, but i find the pricing and selection to be the be best. i stop in once a week or so, and frequently make purchases. one of my friends scored an amazing mid-century dining set here. pricing is generally realistic--i'm parsimonious to put it nicely, and i still buy here! they have sorted out a problem that arose a while back with some consigned carpets that reeked of animal urine. someone must do a sniff test now before accepting. good idea! the staff is nice. i like the assortment of accessories. it's apparent that a lot of thought and research goes into arriving at prices that are fair to consignors but appeal to shoppers. inventory turns over fast. good store."
5-star,1,"it's amazing the crap people will buy. one person's trash is another person's treasure? i believe so. i sold over $1,000 of my crap at this store. no kidding...and it went fast! my sisters attic is clearly my gold mine, why is everyone looking in the superstitions? this one is prolly a bit smaller than others, but the stuff moves. garage sale? who needs the headache..."
1-star,0,"this place annoys me. the employees are rude. they don't move out of the way to let you shop. they just continue restocking and cleaning the racks. they make you wait if you're just cashing $$ out on your account. no one was in the store, roseanne greeted me and i told her i was cashing out, she asked me to wait while she finished what she was doing. that's fine, but i waited like 5 mins at the counter while she just reattached tags to merchandise. i thought she was a bit rude honestly. i don't like shopping here. deals aren't even good. you can shop at outlet stores, and buy the same stuff brand new for better prices than this used over priced stuff."
1-star,0,customer service was less than acceptable last time i visited this store. i have been bringing clothes here for years to sell and currently have items here for sale. i thought id check what my balance was as i just visited trader joe's next door but the woman behind the counter seemed annoyed i was asking her to check my account. she asked if i knew what was on my account. um no that's why i'm asking and informed me i could do it online now. she was condescending and rude throughout the entire interaction. i'll be taking my clothes elsewhere to sell in the future.
5-star,1,if you love thrift shopping but don't have the time to dig for treasure go here. i have never once left unhappy with the selection!!! even fluctuating between a size 2 and a 10 i've always found clothes that just make me feel so beautiful. and honestly it's the same price for most things as savers! love love love this store!!!
5-star,1,"i have been shopping at this consignment boutique since it opened. it has everything from chanel to lululemon and everything in between. great selection of clothing and accessories, all at a fraction of retail. i love this concept because you find things you don't find anywhere else, items that have been purchased all over the us and abroad. i don't live in az anymore but love this boutique so much that i come back to phoenix just to shop. on my most recent visit i received customer service that exceeded my already high expectations. thank you alexis for storing my luggage. i shopped til i dropped. i'll be back. :)"
1-star,0,"awful selling louis vuitton as real when fake. also, saw manager mean to employees. now, employees are leaving, maybe you need to let management go"
1-star,0,"i was just in there looking for a dress and had three in hand when i went to the dressing room. there three works around the area. all ignored me, but all were attending one lady. i don't care who she was or how much she was spending, it was rude to disregarding someone else. i put the dress back and walked out of the store."
5-star,1,"the 20th street location is by far my favorite of all my sister's closet stores. the store itself has a great selection and boutique-like charm, but what i feel truly sets this location apart is the staff. on multiple occasions i have been assisted by the most courteous and genuine salesperson, a woman i later learned was the store manager, alexis. alexis and her staff clearly have a great deal of retail experience, for they know the nuances of how to anticipate when a client needs assistance and when to allow them to shop freely. this location also has a great selection of pret-a-porter as well as some of the smaller niche brands, and all incredibly organized on shopable racks. i will say that i have never consigned with the company (because my own sister shops my closet!) but i have felt appreciated and treated very well as a customer. i look forward to each and every visit!"
5-star,1,"this is a small, tucked away location near by nordstrom rack and snooze! it has a little less inventory than the one on scottsdale are but way more helpful employees! leah was kind enough to help me when the other store had overcharged me. she didn't have to do this but she went out of her way to make it right for me so that i didn't have to go back to the other store. this location had amazing brands and prices. i got parker, frame, iro, dvf, tory burch, lululemon and so much more. even though this store has less inventory, i left with way more stuff! thanks again ladies for helping me upgrade my closet and handle the issue from the other store!"
1-star,0,"please do yourself a favor and do not buy or consign with this merchant. these sisters are out to get you and your mighty dollar. their consignment fees are absurd. their pricing is so unrealistic and unfair across the board. i have sold and bought with them for a number of years until i woke up and realized that i was being ripped off. you can sell your items on ebay with ease and more money in your pocket. the staff is snotty, no matter what location you go to. like they're doing you a favor. they are only nice to you when you're buying from them. when you're there to get money out of your account. they are cold and abrupt (all locations equally across the board). very sneaky and underhanded business. do not go! you will be disappointed."
3-star,0,"for a consignment store it was not as exciting as i thought it would be. especially with a nordstrom rack right there to try to have competitive pricing. store was clean and organized but not as high quality or classy as i had read online it to be. brands were here and there but the quality was a mix of nwt and past gently used. two or three girls were working and not one of them said a single word to me or any other customers that i saw. i may take another look when i am back in town, and may not."
4-star,1,"i been coming to my sisters closet for the longest time! you get pretty good deals especially for the name brands like ann taylor, loft and banana republic. i did notice that the prices for the shirts have gone up. you use to be able to find shirts from $9-$10 and now a 95% of their shirts are $12.95. but it still has a nice clothing selection."
5-star,1,"i was surprised to see reviews from disappointed customers but it seems like some of them were related to their experience consigning clothes here rather than buying clothes here. what's bad for the consigner is good for me!! (low prices) i'm a l-xl and scored here with a dress, sweater and 2 pairs of shoes for $60. i wasn't sure about the dress but when i got it on it was flattering. you have to pick through everything and try on everything that you think might work and you end up finding just a few things that do... but that's why consignment store shopping is fun! and i thought this was a solid consignment store. i don't see an option to add a photo of my haul to this review but i'll add it in the photos for this location."
5-star,1,"one of my favorites places to shop and find unique clothing to add to my wardrobe...love, love, love shopping at my sister's closet!"
2-star,0,i have been consigning for more than 2 decades and most recently here and my experience has not been the best. from items being dropped off never making it on my account to items being priced at pennies to the dollar is unacceptable. i have to add how rude the manager is i don't know her name but i just tried to cash out the remainder of my account and was told they are closed and the door shut on my face. well bitch i know this but maybe if i was able to cash out on the men's side i would not have to even have contact with your rude ass. i will be visiting the store tomorrow just to give her an ear full... very inconvenient and definitely not how you treat shoppers nor consigners.
2-star,0,"their advertising is very misleading. when a ""half-off all sweaters"" lands in your inbox, one gets to the store and notes the exceptions are not only designer labels, somewhat understandable, but one has to read every tiny label to determine if a top is labeled a ""sweater"". i choose three ""sweaters"" and none qualified. at my age, i think i know what a sweater is! i am not returning ever again. (thank you for apologizing but the sweaters i selected fell into none of the categories you mentioned) this is a typical bait & switch advertising ploy---actually, it probably could be reported."
2-star,0,"a long term consignor, i didn't really keep track of the items i brought in, or the individual amount received for them. i donate many things to charity, but take the more expensive things here. well, i took a necklace, honora pale green, freshwater pearls in their leather pouch into msc. i paid $185 for them and had never worn them. i was paid $7.50 for the pearls!! it is my opinion, when there is an item one expects to sell for at least $85+, they should let you know, before giving them away for peanuts. i was not happy, although an employee called me after my inquiry as to what happened to the pearls. i think with designer clothes, one is better off sending them to the real real. they pay 70% and shipping. from now on i will donate all other items to charity and take the donation receipt, rather than feel as if i had been ""taken"". the staff is friendly for the most part, but many do not know quality when they see it, and reject things that would sell and are valuable.,the store is well organized, and i'm sure if you buy anything, you'll get a great deal-especially if you bought my pearls."
2-star,0,"i had a very similar experience to allison g. (review written on 9/16/2014). i went in to collect my money at my sister's closet at t&c today. i approached the sales gal standing at the register and explained to her what i was there to do. i was told to go to another register in a rather apathetic and dismissive demeanor. prior to today, approx. 56 days ago, i took in 8 items to sell and 7 of them sold. they were decent labels (bcbg dresses, coach purse, elie tahari skirt, cache leather skirt, italian suede blazer, banana republic skirt, etc.) and what i received in return in cash was $55. i asked jenny (sales person) if i could take home my 1 remaining item and they wanted to charge me $5.00 to do so (and that charge will be going up soon according to jenny and the sign she brusquely pointed to). it was because it was an item they had priced under $25. ""it's in the contract"" jenny so gruffly explained. so when taking your clothes for consignment i highly suggest that you stay current on your contract so you know exactly what kind of exchange you will experience from them. apparently they make changes to your contract whenever they see fit and do not notify you of the changes other than the signs they post in-store. be cautious and informed before doing business here. i've had my account there for years and i've never felt so dismissed by the sales persons (esp. jenny), so uninformed, and frankly, ripped off. bottom-line: doing business with my sisters closet feels bad. i will not be taking my items to be sold there to receive very little in return and to be treated so poorly for being a client of theirs. i'd rather donate my clothes to a good cause, get a tax write-off that i believe is a better financial decision and, more importantly, feel good about doing it."
4-star,1,"hey now... i stopped by my sister's closet on my way out of last chance, as it is just literally a block or two away. they have some cute things in here, i scored a pair of pilcro shorts for 10.00 as well as some saucony running shoes for $12.00, not bad! this store is really small, and they have an odd mix of mall brand clothing all the way to higher end stuff. i saw a pair of size 9 tory burch miller sandals (brown brand new) for around $50.00, too bad they weren't my size or else i woulda snatched those bad boys up. overall i think their selection is kinda small, i easily went through all the racks in 30 mins, if you have some time to kill you could get lucky and end up finding one or two things you really like."
4-star,1,super fun place to shop for high quality clothing and accessories at bargain prices. they have a large selection especially good for work clothes lots of suits and dresses. good selection of evening clothes as we'll. beautiful jewelry too. other locations in town a fun day to bit them all.
4-star,1,"the gals buying are always super friendly and go over why some items weren't selected. i appreciate that. the manager is also quite friendly! selling clothes maybe because the area has more professional business women but i do well with certain items here. i bring my ann taylor and whbm, along with banana republic and other decent work attire brands. buying clothes i've found some great jeans in small sizes (24-25) here! r&r for $35. yay!!"
4-star,1,"the ladies here are always so friendly and i often find designer items with the original hang tags on them (typically for less than 25% of the original price). i can't imagine what there is not to like! scottsdale lacks a great designer discount store (so long, loehmans), and this place really fills that role. plus, the women who work here seem to really like clothes and to know a great deal on a consignment item when they see it. i have never had anything but a positive experience here. from vintage watches to chanel suits to little cotton t-shirts, you are bound to find something fun and stylish here. (chanel and st. john are not my thing, but there is plenty of that stuff, at outrageously low prices, if that is what you're looking for.) do know that every trip to this store is something of a treasure hunt. they sell formal wear, career wear, outerwear, handbags, accessories, everyday clothing and jewelry, but it's best not to go in looking for something specific. you can expect to find on-trend items in an array of sizes...and at a fraction of the price you'd pay for them elsewhere."
3-star,0,"a-ok, seems to be a fair description. i've found a few items by chance, but for the most part, i'm not that impressed with what this location carries. i can't imagine why someone would buy a used tiffany necklace with someone else's initials on it, but ok... the best part of this location is that if you hit and miss, at least you have trader joes and nordstrom rack backroom in the same plaza so that the trip isn't wasted."
1-star,0,"smaller sizes...not much for the plus or large crowd. also, the staff is almost incredulously rude everytime i'm in here! i know people love it here, but it's like a very expensive goodwill. the clothes and accessories are way overpriced for what you're getting! save yourself some money and go down to the goodwill at 16th st and indian school. also, if you have clothes to sell, don't get your hopes up. gawd knows i've tried to figure out what they are looking for...when they did take a couple of my smaller size 12 sundresses to consign, they ended up giving them away to a thrift store for dogs (i shit you not) and didn't even bother to call me. i guess that's not their policy...if you consign here and they don't sell your stuff in whatever time frame they think they should, don't expect to ever get it back."
4-star,1,"while i can't say i've ever actually purchased anything for myself, i keep coming back to my sister's closet. it's probably more the thrill of the hunt for that perfect (shirt/pants/jacket/etc) that keeps me interested. maybe its just me, but they usually don't have much in my size. they do have plenty of med - large sizes and 35 - 40 waist pants. fyi msc - i wear a 38s jacket, size s collared shirts, a 30ish waist with 29inch inseam, and size 7 1/2 - 8 shoe; just in case you were wondering. ;) my wife seems to have some luck though. she's found a few designer shirts, a couple pairs of 7 jeans, and even some cool coach purses. i think this is definitely a better place for the female shopper. best of luck to all you shoppers; and who knows, maybe you'll bump into me in there not buying something. :("
4-star,1,"""name brand clothing without the name brand price tag"" although being male, my sister's seems to be a big hit among the women in my family. i am related to shopaholics and bargain hunters and though it seems that these may be part of a genetic predisposition to the asian gene on both sides of the family, you would think that i spend my weekends on this expensive past time. i don't. but i do enjoy finding my bargain name brands here which are plenty at well suited (male counterpart to my sister's closet). by coming here, i not only save on $$, but save on time spent shopping all over malls and waiting for sales desired clothing. they do have spectacular sales about twice a year on the consigned articles up to another 70% off (usually in late january and august). this is to make room for new seasonal items. while others may cringe at the thought of wearing consigned clothing, it is their loss due to the amazing savings. i cannot speak on the consignment system as i have not brought in any of my clothing, but i can attest to the selection to buy which are great, clean, and organized; providing opportunity for us to wear name brand clothing without the name brand price. if you think this was useful, cool, or funny, please check below."
2-star,0,"i love love love consignment stores...and walking in this store, the smell was great... however... i have to say i am disappointed with my sister's closet. i had heard such great things, so i was really excited to go. they did have some amazing designer purses, including a $3400 jimmy chu purse that was huge and gorgeous for $1899. the designer section clothing was hung on nice wooden hangers with their logo (nice touch). however....... the items i saw around the store, and my friend with me agreed, seemed like more than 40% really were more appropriate for a thrift store, and a lot of the items were really dirty (and still had high prices). you could see food stains on a dooney bag.. a coach wristlet, black, had white food smeared all over it... still highly priced for as dirty as it is. the thing is... even if it is a brand.. sometimes your store reputation is worth more than the 10 bucks you'll make by selling something dirty. just my .02. i saw sensors put though jeans pockets, wallets (in the leather!) and other questionable placements. when i asked about it.. the sales person just said, well maybe there is someone new who does not put it in the right place. that damages items people are buying, and they may not realize the big holes placed by those sensors. i loved there ""on the web"" tags. i've never seen that before, but they are really pretty and catch your eye if you want to take a closer look. i prefer consignment stores to identify the sizes on the hanger by color coding or some such to make it easier to find my sizes. i get bored really fast trying to find my size.. as a consumer, i would have spent more time looking had i been able to really scan the racks easier for size. the shoes are nicely organized.... and clearly labeled. they were not over crowded so it was easy to see the shoes. there are some positives.. i purchased a le sportsac tiny bag for 9.99, it was new so i do feel it was a good deal. but really be careful what you buy.. the prices for the purses seemed high for used resale and their obvious usage stains."
3-star,0,"i never had a sister...but i remember while i was still very young being able to rummage through my moms closet... i remember this cool blue velvety/terry cloth track suit she had that i really liked....ahh the '80s...but then i hit the 4th grade.... the 2 times i have been in here the only things i found of interest were some of the shoes and the handbags and purses. as for the clothes, they really don't carry anything in plus sizes. or at least not for plus size under 50 years old and even then the selection is slim. for those under a size 10 you may be able to find a few more things. i find the prices to be reasonable (although i have yet to buy anything.) it's a clothing consignment store so you have folks bringing in their stuff for evaluation. they seem to like chicos, and there are racks of chicos stuff. so if that is your thing you may be able to put together an outfit or 3. or you may be able to sell your stuff to them. but they do have other high end designer brands here, without much looking. while it's not for me, i do feel it is worthy of checking out."
4-star,1,found some great deals! they had shirts with additional discounts getting them down to about $3 and the clothes all seemed in very good condition. bought bcbg blouses and a cute summer dress that i used right away to wear to mill ave. with friends. only a slight wait for a fitting room and the lighting isn't all that great but the prices are good. staff is friendly too. will be going back soon.
5-star,1,"this is the best one yet (out of all of the my sister's closets). i've found so many yummy things here. cashmere sweaters, designer jeans (sevens, ag and people's republic), coach sandals, a prada moon bag and some juicy couture dresses - and those are just the highlights. they're very picky what they accept when you consign, but that's what makes them a good consignment shop and their prices are really pretty good. i always stop here after last chance. it completes my shopping day and a good deal makes me happy. forget prozac, what we need are prada bags for $200 (it was a super sale day - and i'm not on prozac, just being facetious)."
4-star,1,"oh yeah, do i love my sister's closet!!! some of my favorite duds were found here. now let's get this straight: like any consignment store, it's hit or miss--you may find a fabulous st. john's suit here one day and dreck the next. but for those who are into cheap duds that look like you found them at saks or nordstrom [and not nordstrom's last chance!!!] and for those who are patient enough to keep coming back--and back--and back again, you can find something here. just like any other thrift store, though it seems like we real-sized women get short shrift. but maybe that's because they're not into cool threads like i am...but i have still found some great stuff here, so keep coming. and coming back. and i may start consigning myself, so all you fashionistas out there who think that size 2 means that a girl's just not getting enough to eat should come here and pick up all my old designer duds that i've grown tired of."
5-star,1,"i enjoyed my experience at nycsole. we didn't receive the name of the girl who helped us but she was very sweet and helpful. shoes were 50% off so my boyfriend got two and i also got two. which were a total of $100 a lot of sizes were gone, but the girl was patient to help us find the shoes we wanted in our sizes. she also explained to me the shoes were final sale but who would even want to return such a good deal. i'm a local so i will definitely be returning soon. :)"
1-star,0,"terrible manager owner, extremely rude...great shows ....very nice lady helping us . even she was very scared of the manager/owner...horrible attitude and only took cash ! i guess cause it cost him to use credit cards...there were no signs that said cash only but at the end he only wasted cash . he really was a mean man...do not shop there"
1-star,0,"this will be my first yelp review: i visited the las vegas store and was pleasantly greeted and helped by a wonderful human being who gave me her feedback (unfortunately i do not remember the sales associate's name). 5 stars for her in store service. i was told if these shoes do not fit (i was surprising my girlfriend) that i would be able to ship these shoes back and return them with free shipping (i live in los angeles), to which i agreed. the shoes did not fit, so now the return process begins (i should have known better)... i contact the david z website, i am told i can return the merchandise and i was also told i will need to pay the shipping cost, which i find completely unacceptable for the following reasons: 1. i was told by in-store personnel i would be able to return free of charge before 30 days 2. the david z web site states the following: a. once we have reviewed and approved your case we will send you a pre-paid shipping label. b. you can return your purchase for up to 30 days from the purchase date. c. product(s) must be in the condition you received them and in the original box and/ or packaging. d. return shipping is 100% free e. if you are not completely satisfied with your purchase you can return your order for free within 30days of your purchase date (returns must be unworn, in the state you received them, and in the original packaging). f. you will be provided with a pre-paid ups or similar domestic label to return the purchase to us.* i attempted to contact the corporate representatives via email and via phone to further discuss this matter, to which i have heard no response back in either form of communication. pro-tip - ignoring a customer doesn't really solve the problem...go figure it only upsets them more? interesting concept. i later found the exact same shoes at nordstrom for 40% off. i would highly recommend individuals stay away from this ill managed company that fluffs impressive claims but do not follow through. competition is fierce and customer service is everything. i'd much rather do business with a larger competitor, than support a smaller business, when this smaller business has really nothing to offer other than uncompetitive pricing, false advertisement and poor corporate level customer service. thanks for playing david z nyc..."
1-star,0,"the shoes we bought broke within minutes of wearing. we tried to return them the same day and were told the manager would come and discuss the issue with us in about an hour. after two and a half hours of waiting the manager called the attendant and said we were not to get an exchange or refund under any terms because the shoes were worn too much. despite returning within hours and not even having walked to dinner in them, the shoes lacked durability and the store refused to even meet us half way."
1-star,0,"shoes are overpriced, even for the strip. the workers were helpful, but i took an issue with the fat manager in the store. he was very unwelcoming and rude. i don't know if he was having a bad day or not, but it's no excuse and now i'll never go back"
5-star,1,"i had been lusting over a particular pair of shoes for months and finally decided it was time to splurge and get them. i originally went to another store that i knew carried the shoes, but left when i could not get any service from the employees... carlos was the employee that helped me at david z nyc. i wasn't sure what size i needed, carlos got out three different shoes for me to try on, including the store sample. once i figured out which size fit best, carlos rang me up and what do you know, the shoes were on sale! i think i have a new favorite shoe store!!"
5-star,1,"this is another one of those must stop by places whenever i go to vegas. at first glance it may appear as though the store appeals to the younger crowd but once you get inside the store, you realize they appeal to everyone. the service is great and not pushy at all. i love the fact that when i bring shoes home from this place, i always get raves from others about it!"
1-star,0,"wow felt like i was invisible in there. didn't even get a hello. they said hello to customer that came in after me, didn't even ask if i had any questions. it looked like there was plenty of employees that could have helped me, not like they were super busy or anything. i was actually interested in a fairway wood and the vapor pro irons but it looked they didn't care that i was in there. well looks like they lost a potential customer cause i love nike."
2-star,0,"while vacationing, i wandered in and found a pair of golf shoes that i like. not carrying my desired color, the employee offered to order them online and ship directly to me. they arrived a couple weeks later and didn't fit correctly. one of the shoes had a ridge that i could feel under the foot. they were clearly asymmetric in their fit. i called the store and was told by a different employee that i'd have to pay to ship them back to the store. since they're not affiliated with nike and are the only nike golf store in the country, i had no other options. so even though they were defective, i'd have to pay to remedy the situation. that's bull."
1-star,0,"terrible service. first, i am staying at mandalay bay. in the room there is a booklet of offers. one of them is for a free swing analysis and 20% off at nikegolf. the first time i went into the store with my wife the sales clerk was alone. i inquired about the golf analysis and wide shoes. he said he was alone in the store and couldn't go to the back room or do the golf analysis and asked me to come back later. my wife stopped in later while she was shopping (visit 2) and found out they do have wide shoes. i was able to go back the next day (visit 3) and was told again that the sales clerk was alone and i could come back in 45 minutes. i returned again (visit 4). finally, there were two people in the store and they could help me. so now i've shown a lot of interest in shopping at this store and one of the clerks was there each time so knew the interest. so now i inquired about wide golf shoes and the swing analysis. i was then told they no longer do the free analysis and they didn't know why the advertisement was in the rooms. the clerk then said they did have some wide shoes, but was vary reluctant to help. she finally brought me one pair of wide shoes, and said there might have more in the back. while i was trying on the first pair of shoes i was expecting her to get more shoes to try on. nope, she didn't. it became vary clear that they didn't have any interest in helping me find the right shoes. after i came in four times to talk to them you'd think they would bend over backwards because i would probably buy from them."
1-star,0,"my review isn't so much about the store and what their selection is like its more about the service i received at the store, my husband and i are in town for a large kia convention and i forgot to pack him some casual socks. so while he was at his event at the mandalay bay i went in to get him a pair of $7.50 socks. the cashier was helping a customer and i waited and waited as they decided what golf balls they wanted. the lady spent about $100 in products she paid with a visa and left. i went to pay for the socks a total of $8.11. i had to use my husbands card because i had lost mine well he asks me for id i explained that it was my husbands card because i lost mine he wouldn't take it, i asked to charge it to my room he wouldn't do it either cause i wasn't on the reservation, finally i just paid with another card and left. mind you we have the same last name i had the room key and the envelope for my room key, i left pretty upset because why wasn't the customer in front of me who spent a bit more than i did asked for id and i was? just because its a woman's name on the card doesn't mean it's hers! i am all for security and checking id and i would've been totally fine if he would've just asked her for her id. customers should all be treated the same if you're going to ask one customer for id you should ask them all!"
3-star,0,for all things nike this store is pretty nice. it's a bit pricey but the fact you can get club fitted here makes it nice. if you have chips in your pocket make a stop to get your tiger on.
3-star,0,"i love golf....i have been playing for a while now but tiger woods i definitely am not... and my handicap leaves something to be desired but i love playing the game nonetheless. i was recently invited to play in a small friendly competition and gladly accepted. so i figured that i needed to dust off and take inventory of all my golfing gear because i haven't played in a while and needed to be prepared....soon after, i realized that my putter was missing, my bag was ragged and needed some help, and i was in desperate need of some new threads to show off on the course with as well. so i came here.... i love nike products and think they are of great quality but what i didn't realize is that i was going to need to give the blood of my future first born and sign my soul away just get a putter. man....the prices were ridiculous!! so overpriced.....and to think i actually wanted to buy a new shirt and bag on top of the new putter that would have cost me more than next month's rent....crazy!! but needless to say the store was beautiful. selection of all things golf is any golfers dream but i'd rather spend my money at sports chalet at a cheaper price for my golf supplies any day."
4-star,1,"i love nordstrom, but nordstrom southpark is a bit of a ""swing and a miss"". four stars feels generous, but three stars seems too harsh; too bad you can't give halves. their shoe selection is out of this world fabulous, but the clothing selection leaves a lot to be desired - it is minimal. i also felt as though the customer service was a bit lacking from the typical nordstrom experience. the store is on the smaller side with the majority of the ground floor being taken up by cosmetics. all of the women's clothing is upstairs. they have all of your nordstrom ""departments"" (point of view, encore, bp., dresses, active wear, collectors, etc.); however, each one has only a very small selection... the largest selection of styles was probably in dresses. i would like to give a special nod to the ebar. the baristas were friendly and quick, the area was clean, and my latte tasted great."
4-star,1,"i love shopping at nordstrom... the customer service and policies are just a notch above other retailers. this store is much like others beautiful, clean, and a simple floor plan with directives at the base of each escalator. anytime i have needed help at this location it's been a good experience. namely, i was searching for some jewelry for my wedding rehearsal dinner and day-of. the woman behind the counter was so extremely patient and kind as i tried on earring after earring. she also gave me great advice. i love each piece i bought. most recently, i went in looking for kids ray bans - unfortunately they don't carry them. but the women who helped me ran a search on the computer first and tried to help me find something that would have fit better, if not the same. i will always be a nordstrom shopper!"
1-star,0,where is the 3rd floor of southpark nordstrom? i have never gone to a nordstrom the house no product available to buy nothing in the few immediately designers that this norstrom's in charlotte carries are awful there's nothing colorful every thing is gray black navy blue and burgundy even when it was summertime those were the only colors that this norstrom would carry please build a third floor onto this norstrom so the people can actually have designers to shop
2-star,0,"let me just say i love nordstrom however my recent visit to the nordstrom lancome makeup counter was extremely subpar. i was approached by a young lady who referred a young man to me...someone who apparently knew about lancome. finally after waiting 5+ minutes for him to stop talking to a fellow coworker he came over to help me with my purchase. i was in need of a gift for my mother's birthday. i knew i wanted some lancome makeup/foundation but was unsure of which one i wanted or their benefits. he showed little concern. i told him to use my skin color as reference so he proceeded to dab my face with a product. not once did he tell me the benefits of the product, what he was using, the color... zilch. he just wanted to get me a product and send me on my way. hindsight i should have left the counter from the start. i'll think twice before i go back to the makeup counter at nordstrom. i should have, could have, my bad... my fault i wasn't a bit more assertive."
5-star,1,"always very helpful staff. phill, in the men's department, knows his profession well and remembers me when i come in. my wife had not shopped there prior to today. she found helpful staff that aided in the purchase of a barbour jacket."
5-star,1,love this store and their customer service! this is the place i like to go back again and again! think of shopping- hands down the first choice. good job for the team south park nordstrom
3-star,0,"hit or miss service. the service at this nordstrom can be hit or miss. some times they are really helpful with me and my girlfriend. sometimes i'm allowed in the changing room to see what she has tried on. but several times i have been told to wait outside the changing room and once even to wait away from the changing room in the chairs 30 feet away. really nordstrom. they do not say men or women or child changing rooms.... if you have a problem with me there, put up some signage so i can't make a case as to why i want to stand there."
5-star,1,"i love nordstrom, i use to avoid this department store because i thought they would be too pricey for me but they always have great sales, selection, and services. today i used a makeup stylist to get my makeup done for my birthday. stylist are free but they suggest you buy an item. terri craft was amazing and before i was even done so many people were complementing me. she was so personable and fun to work with. i will definitely be back to get my makeup but done in the future !"
5-star,1,"nordstrom is the best department store out there. excellent selection and great customer service. they have a stellar return policy, one of the best in the industry. their semi-annual sales are great too."
1-star,0,i am extremely disappointed with the service today at nordstrom... the service is what usually brings me in but today it was disappointing... i will give them another chance because of the great service they usually provide. the purse my wife opened this morning for christmas turned out to be a returned purse... had candy wrappers and hair inside it... returned it and the management felt bothered by us bringing it back in....
5-star,1,"nordstrom is my favorite department store, hands down. the one at south park is just the right size, so it feels like you're shopping in a simultaneously large and cozy store. it's luxurious but doesn't feel uptight. the selection of clothing is beautiful and high-quality. every department is very well-maintained. nordstrom prides itself on delivering great service, and it certainly is fantastic here. try to find jennifer in the shoe department, because she is just excellent. she is what all sales associates should be. my size wasn't in stock, so she placed an order and had it shipped to my house free of charge. also, the coffee at the entrance on the first floor is top-notch. stop and get some to sip on while you shop. unlike most other department stores, nordstrom just feels serene. shopping can be exhausting and stressful, but nordstrom somehow manages to make it a different, positive experience."
2-star,0,"this place is ridiculously expensive. also, the staff are a little rude. i needed help finding some things and the lady i asked looked at me like i just didn't belong there, and then walked away before she even finished answering my question. i don't think i'll be back, it's just not worth the money or the hassle."
5-star,1,i love nordstom. i like most that it is not a super crowded department store. the sales staff are very personable and not pushy. i love that you can order online (for free shipping) and return to the store. i usually stop here first before going to the other little stores.
2-star,0,worst customer service at the jewelry/watch counter i've ever experienced. girl was absolutely no help. she wanted to direct me to a kiosk in the mall to fix my mk watch. but she didn't even know the name or where the this kiosk was located. i bought my watch from this store specifically because i was told their customer service was superior when it came to their merchandise and so i would not have to get anything repaired or replaced at a rinky-dink kiosk in the mall. i will not be returning.
5-star,1,"i was here to return a dress i ordered online. i ordered a size too small... tear. the dress was too tight... one to many pieces of pizza and i needed a size bigger! i went in to the topshop section and the girl at the counter, lindsay, was awesome! she called around to other stores and found my size. they are shipping the larger (bummer) size straight to my house! super easy and painless! thanks lindsay! i love nordstrom!"
4-star,1,"i have been on the hunt for knee high black riding boots since august. i have bought and returned 2 pairs already and was checking out the nordstrom website when i decided to just head to the store during my lunch break. i have to say the customer service was really excellent! i was helped by shane and we talked for a few minutes about what i was looking for and once he got an idea for the style i wanted he went in search of all the boots he could find in my size. he came back with a good mix of high and low priced boots and i didn't feel like he was going to pressure me to go for a more expensive pair. he sat there and took out each pair and put them back in the box when i was done, made polite small talk. such a contrast from when i went to another department store and they basically threw the box at me and ran away! i found a great pair of boots and i am very happy with the experience. i think overall i always am when i got to nordstrom, its just not my everyday shopping destination, its usually more for shoes, bags that type of thing."
4-star,1,"for all things luxury, nordstrom's is the place to shop! i was looking for a kate spade iphone case & saw online that nordstrom's was having a huge ""fashion brands anniversary sale."" and thankfully everything was marked off to like 50% off. nordstrom's is gorgeous inside, neatly organized & clean. salespeople are extremely friendly & not pushy. i really like that! naturally, regular prices here are expensive, but if you have ""that kind of money"", then by all means, spend away! like every other major retailer, they have sales quite frequently, so maybe that item you're spying will go on sale soon enough."
5-star,1,"jenny, manager on duty at the nordstrom southpark store displayed exemplary customer service on saturday july 6,2012. i will always shop at nordstrom due to the customer service. it is over the top!!!!!"
4-star,1,"i love shopping! and this store makes it a lot more fun! they have a huge variety of items and some of the most helpful and friendly associates i've ever been around. it's like they pride themselves on having superior customer service. no matter the department, everyone is willing to help you find whatever you need. great shopping experience! i will be back!"
4-star,1,"customer service! someone still has it this day in age! after waiting for several minutes for someone to help me over at dillard's, i simply gave up, walked into nordstrom, and purchased the same pair of shoes in no time flat! to the employee who helped me: hats off to you good sir!"
5-star,1,it is the absolute best shopping experience available. wouldn't it be great if all retailers aspired to this level of customer service!!!!
5-star,1,"nordstroms offers such an elevated shopping experience that it's a wonder we even bother with the other department stores in south park mall. regardless of what you're looking, they have exactly what you need for that specific event. the salespeople are super helpful and have a great eye for finding your style. and despite the high-level offerings, it's not as outlandishly expensive as your needless markup comparison; they also offer semi-annual sales, and their website offers great markdowns. but the thing i absolutely love the most is their return policy. order online and return to the store, return something far past other stores' 90 day cutoff, whatever, and they'll take it back, no questions asked. how far does that go? i just returned a pair of shoes that i bought 4 years ago and had never worn - 5 minutes later, i had my return receipt and the dollars were credited to my card. i can't think of another store that offers that level of customer service. thank you for going above and beyond, nordstroms!"
2-star,0,"i've wandered the isles of nordstrom many a time and besides the shoe selection - it's eh. if i want some shoes, i'm going straight here. but if i'm looking for a cute dress or blouse, i'll go here dead last. of the many, many times i've been to nordstrom i have never once been helped, which has ultimately stopped me from buying anything time after time. i've found a few items i've considered and then realized i don't love them, i just want to buy them because i can't figure out why i've never bought anything here (except shoes) when this is my type of place. on my last trip i realized, i've never bought anything at nordstrom because of the lack of service. i wander around hopelessly looking for something very specific, and wanting to drop some serious cash, and not a single sales shark even sniffs in my direction. immediately, i'm turned off. i'll go to marshall's where i expect bad service and the things i would have bought at nordstrom are half price."
5-star,1,"can i get trina turk online for cheaper? can i get bobbi brown online, tax free? can i scour ebay and buy 2 pairs of slightly used jimmy choos for the price of one at nordie's? absolutely. but when i do shop retail, this is my poison of choice. nordstrom's philosophy is to provide great customer service. i should say it's oustanding, either at the retail store, or rack location. tip: make friends with your sales associate if you click with him/her. it's invaluable. when you get a good one, he or she will cater to your every need and give you the heads up on upcoming sales. for example, at the nordstrom in kansas, my sa not only called me when a jacket or pair of jeans i had been eying was about to go on sale-- she would private shop with me, and pull items in my size she thought i'd like so the shopping experience would take less time, and be more efficient. here at southpark, one of the sa's, kesh even text messages me handbags she thinks i'd like, and gave me the heads up weeks in advance of what would be on sale. if you're trying on anything, the sa's are great about attending to you, calling in a tailor if alterations are necessary...you feel like a million bucks, even if you're buying a $25 t-shirt. i never feel pressured to buy anything (although there is a woman in lingerie who needs to work on the finesse...and a young man in the bp shoes department who blatantly targeted me in the designer handbags section where he knew nothing about the designer, to try and sell me a $1k bag. not classy, but i'll chalk it up to inexperience and arrogance.) so there's rarely any buyer's remorse. the return policy is also beyond anything i've ever experienced. i once bought a white belt i thought would go with a blue dress, and when i got home, it didn't go well at all. one year later, i felt guilty, and didn't want to seem like i was abusing the policy, but i was able to return the belt, no questions asked. there is a book called retail hell, a first-hand account of being a sa at nordstrom, where people would try and return handbags that were clearly scuffed and used... and one woman had an open tampon inside the bag...and still was able to return it! this i do not approve of, and wish the return policy wouldn't be abused like this. oh, and charge sends. if you don't see something in store you've seen online, the sa's will search the entire nordie's national network and locate the item for you and have it shipped right to your door. this is beyond helpful and has saved me multiple times. tip: when you shop the annual anniversary sale, where fall styles go on sale before they're in season, either go early on a weekday, or shop late in the day. ladies are like predators during this time, and will shop frantically for these deals. don't be alarmed. if the size you want isn't there, get it charge sent. tip 2: if you shop here a lot...getting a nordstrom debit is a great value. (i hate store credit cards, since it's another bill to worry about. with debit, it just comes out of your bank account like a regular debit card.) you'll get points for every purchase, and nordstrom note gc's every so often...plus if you reach a certain level, free alterations (whoo hoo!) and beauty bonuses. (in the past 6 months i've gotten cards sent to me for free 3 piece mini mascaras, and 3 lipglosses from big beauty brands.) ok, i'm going to stop yammering now...but just in case my review didn't get my point across clearlyl...i love me some nordstrom!"
5-star,1,"ah, nordstrom, both the light and the bane of my existence. you take all my money and leave me with fashionable clothes, shoes, accessories and cosmetics. this is my favorite department store in all of the land. merchandise is quality and can be pricey, but the nordstrom semi-annual and anniversary sales are paramount, people. with everything from designer jeans to athletic gear on deep discount, these are most definitely the times to go. service is some of the best in the retail industry and their return policy is second to none. me likey. this particular nordstrom is well-placed in the high end wing of southpark mall. parking is typically a snap - entering off of fairview is my preferred parking deck and walk yourself right in to the second floor. one last little nugget of info for all you shoppers out there: if you see something online that you cannot purchase in store, order it from the store - shipping is free. yes. free. walk yourself up to a retail counter and ask one of the nice ladies or gentlemen to place an online order for you. done and done. i've even called this in before...save money on quality mech. thanks, nordies!"
4-star,1,"i am rarely a department store shopper by any stretch of the imagination, and now that i mention it, i am not much of a shopper of any kind. it has also been years since i have been to a nordstrom. probably since i lived in seattle and their logo was the one of the all lowercase, computerized font. i think they dropped that in the early nineties (though i actually left seattle long before that happened). so it has been a while. regardless, this nordstrom is actually quite nice. even the logo. the staff is friendly and helpful, and even if you do not have your receipt, they are more than happy to take your return and make sure that you get something you like in exchange - generally at a slightly higher price, of course."
5-star,1,"nordstrom is high end yet within reach. though it comes across as ritzy, there are plenty of sales and affordable items. the shoe department always has a great selection. the upstairs cafe and downstairs e-bar always have great food!"
5-star,1,"the cafe upstairs (on the belk side of the store) has great food (and drinks). the customer service is terrific; i wanted to buy a pair of shoes on sale but my size was out of stock, a pair at home appeared via ups, with no shipping cost, just a few days later. the clothes are great and pretty stylish. you'll be well-dressed, well-fed and made to feel good when you shop here. unlike neiman marcus, you don't have to jump through hoops and be treated as if the store is doing you a favor to let you shop there."
4-star,1,"now 5 stars specifically for blair at the bobbi brown counter - because she was just awesome! super nice to both me and my friend and totally helped us out. granted, she ended up making a huge sale, since my friend was specifically there to get some makeup from bobbi brown, but that's besides the point. because we could have easily walked away if she got ugly. we didn't really peruse the rest of the store though, sorry. this is why i'm giving it a 4 instead of a 5, since the 5 would really only be for blair, and not really for the whole store."
4-star,1,"i'm from california and i was so happy to see that south park had a nordies!! i always catch their sales and find the cutest shoes there!! mostly, i go for the makeup counters!! :) i always go to mac, of course, but today i stopped by bobbi brown. i had to kill the rest of a giftcard (b/c it was burning a whole in my wallet) and i wanted to purchase some new makeup. and that's when i met blair...i don't know her last name but she was phenomenal!! all the folks at the nordies makeup counters are always super friendly and never too invasive, but blair was excellent!! she helped me remember what bobbi cosmetics i had tried at another store and she was very helpful teaching me how to apply everything! she even gave me, and my friend, samples of some other products to try!! please visit nordies! the best time to shop is during their sales, but every now and then, they have makeup events where certain brands (like mac or bobbi brown) send their artists in to help teach you how to use the products and whatnot (if you are into makeup)!! i also enjoy the pianists they have who play while you're shopping!!"
5-star,1,great clothing store. i found everything i need. the customer service are great there. i shop there for every major event.
5-star,1,top of the line!!! second to none! quality materials. exceptional customer service....nyoni is always willing to above and beyond to satisfy his customers.
5-star,1,nyoni couture is definitely the best kept secrets in the southeast! world-class quality and exceptional modern styling that fits you impeccably! truly bespoke!
5-star,1,"i called nyoni and shared with him that i wanted two suits for my husband for christmas. within two days the suits were delivered to my house. this was days before christmas and nyoni said to get back to him after my husband tries the suits. well christmas morning he did and loved them. my husband wanted another color than what i got and i called nyoni again and of course he answered. he sent the other color right away even before i returned the original. he has top quality suits, the service is 10, he is response and looks to ensure his customer is completely satisfied. i am so impressed by the service and quality that i have requested a custom made tux because i've always wanted one. i will post a picture once he makes it for me. ladies if you love your man in a suit, buy one of nyoni's suits for him. you will love how he looks. men, do yourselves and favor and add one of these suits to your collection. trust me!! nyoni couture thank you for making my husband look even hotter. :)"
5-star,1,nyoni is very professional and takes his time with each of his clients. truly fashionable guy and will have you looking your best for every occasion. go see him.
5-star,1,"top quality custom suits, personalized attention, and top notch customer service is why i rave about nyoni couture. i live in maryland but after tons of research and referrals from friends and strangers alike, my husband and i had to come visit nyoni couture. we came and nyoni was so patient with my husband, he practically dressed him and he loved it. the suits are tailored to perfection and my husband receives soo many compliments anytime he wears any of nyoni's suits. from being wedding guests to business dinners, my husband stands out. thanks nyoni you will be our only stop for custom suits. thanks so much!! people take my word, check this place out. you won't be disappointed."
1-star,0,"i truly hope that if the manager of this store ever finds herself in a situation where she can avoid some unnecessary embarrassment by simply being able to access a restroom that someone will make an exception for her unlike she did for my young daughter today. it's a restroom and she is a small child that, yes, in the midst of being excited about a pair of new shoes waited a bit too long to say she needed a restroom but seriously, it's a public store you could have taken the opportunity to be helpful and do the right thing. your logic that she couldn't use it cause then you would have to allow everyone else to use it as well was absurd .. the store was empty! plus, in the time you took to explain the ridiculous reason she couldn't use it to me she could have been done and out of your hair and you might have felt good for helping a child who needed it."
5-star,1,"we've been here a few times but i think that we made one purchase up to this point. it's a good size store, rectangle-shaped- it goes pretty deep. it's always clean. the regular selection of shoes are always well-stocked. i just noticed that this store also has handbags (blinders, shoes), located at the front and back. immediate greetings upon entering. there were other customers shopping. today the promotion was ""buy one pair, get the second pair at 50% off."" i always go straight to the clearance section in the back, but i checked both size 6 and 6.5 to be sure (different brands are different sizes). i saw so many pairs of shoes and boots that i really liked- boc, bob's by skechers, crocs, earth, sofft, & many others. i had decided on two pairs when i learned that the promotion also applied to the clearance shoes. i was trying to focus on sandals that would offer support, something for work and vacation, but didn't look like ""old lady"" styles (life is too short for cheap shoes that hurt your feet. - me). i almost got seduced by the lowest-priced ones ($19.99 & $14.99), but i gotta go with which ones were the best and the ones i loved. i opted for two boc pairs of sandals. (i can always go back for the boots, haha.) checkout was pretty good. nice clerk. return policy is good. must have receipt."
4-star,1,"shoe type for all occasions all ages. prices are a little high, but better to buy two pair for the price of one. was able to find dress shoes by one of my favorite designers nina, casual slip ons from steve madden, and vans sneakers. help from staff was available but unnecessary since the shoe sizes are made available on the racks. they also sell designer bags, socks, jewelry, shoe cleaning products, and hats! my new go to store for shoes!"
2-star,0,"after trader joes stepped out and right at the corner of my eye to the left i see ""shoes""! then lol dragged my hubby in there and unfortunately what i was looking for is it of season. next time and petty much like a famous footwear. nice selections and ok!"
4-star,1,"i can sum up this store in one word: selection. of course, you're not going to find any carrie bradshaw worthy shoes here, but you can find a wide range of decently priced boots, sandals, wedges, heels and sneakers for nearly every occasion. that said, i find the store to be a bit hit-or-miss. i love that they generally have sales going on (buy 1, get 1 half-off, for example) but sometimes i have a hard time finding even one pair that i like, much less two. i usually head straight back to check out their sale section, and i have snagged a few good pairs from there. a pair of steve madden flats, some adorable cork and hemp strappy summer wedges and a pair of bear claw, fur-lined boots during the winter months. i don't think i've ever paid more than $30 a pair. it's a clean store with friendly sales associates and plenty of stock, they just might not have what you're looking for the day you happen to walk in but that doesn't mean that in a couple they still won't! my advice? keep checking in. eventually, you will find the perfect pair...of something!"
1-star,0,"i'm going to change the name of this store to: yes, we have no 8 to 9's today! i guess in a way it is my fault. who knew that the asian tourists clobber this store so hard. who knew that these sizes were the ones they wear? who knew that it was kind of a joke to see all the 12's and 13's mocking me (and i didn't see one basketball player in the store)? as for the better styles, they have even less of a choice of sizes!"
1-star,0,"we went here about a week or so ago for the first time because we heard about their bogo sale & the hubby wanted some new work out shoes. we walked in about 5 of us. my husband was trying on a pair of shoes when i noticed a sales associate standing behind us, maybe just a few feet away dead on staring. her & another associate who kept walking by i'm assuming thought we were trying to steal shoes. first of all, i used to work retail & i know how it goes. never have i ever disrespected customers like how we were disrespected. 1. we were not stealing, & 2. if you suspect a customer of stealing which you can be wrong like in our instance; you go up to them and act like you're helping them so that they know you're watching them instead of making innocent customers feel uncomfortable. this idiot employee was so unprofessional. we ended up purchasing 2 pairs of shoes & that was definitely our first and last time at this store."
1-star,0,"walked in tried on some boots. was never greeted, never helped. actually a sales associate walked right pass me to ask another lady if she needed help. after the woman said no, the sales associate again walked directly pass me, like right in my face. idk i think the associates here are racially biased. the don't seem to be interested helping the minority customers. this experience put a bad taste in my mouth and i will not return."
1-star,0,walked in looking for 6 inch all black heels with an ankle strap. wandered around the store for half an hour with no assistance offered. walked out. wasn't greeted at all although there were reps walking all around the store. won't be returning.
2-star,0,"i thought this was saks related. no such luck. it's just a big shoe store with isles and isles of shoes... yet very few wides so nothing for me. the salesperson was helpful but didn't seem to know the stock that well. my standard question when faced with limited sizes is ""what brands run wide?"". no one seemed to know that."
5-star,1,"oh my.... off broadway may have stolen my heart... (i'm sorry for cheating on you, dsw). conveniently located in downtown summerlin, i finally had a chance to mosey over there on my lunch break. oh boy.. shoe nirvana! i think dsw may have a bigger selection, but off broadway is having a sale on their boots, so my eyes lit up like a kid in a candy store. the standout about off broadway, however, was the customer service. maybe it is because they weren't busy, or they are a new store, but the staff was so helpful and kind. i was greeted when i walked in, they explained where things were, let me alone for awhile to browse, came to see if i needed any help, checked sizes in the system when i couldn't find something i wanted, explained the shipping options.. it was pretty darn remarkable. the boots i got were great (and on sale), and the clerk who rang me up was similarly friendly and polite. it's probably a bad thing that they are close to my job...because like arnold says, ""i'll be back!"""
1-star,0,"be careful ordering online with this company. you may think you are ordering a certain color shoe as a photo may demonstrate. only it may not be accurate. unlike amazon. com, this company will not let you cancel the order shortly after the order is placed and you will be stuck with the shipping fee."
2-star,0,"i have to admit when it comes to shoe stores, i am totally biased. since i work for a major online shoe retailer, i feel like i am a huge cheater whenever i go to a brick and mortar shoe store! every once in awhile i will venture in to see how a particular brand fits or looks, but i never buy. off broadway is fairly small and doesn't have much variety. the prices are high and even their clearance section wasn't a very good bargain. on the other hand, the staff was very friendly! if you don't like to buy your footwear online, i suppose it's just as good as any other brick & mortar shoe store out there. i feel guilty even reviewing another shoe retailer!"
4-star,1,"i discovered off broadway shoes in l.a. and have visited it whenever i was there. i was thrilled to find them at downtown summerlin! but i'm still nursing my wounds over not finding the navy blue cowboy boot in my size a year ago in l.a., and they sure haven't made an appearance at this new outpost. they have a great selection of shoes and boots in all price ranges. i don't think it's as extensive as dsw, though. still, it's wonderful to have a big shoe store closer to where i live. they have a fairly generous return policy, 60 days i think. and if you're a guy who wears a very small size shoe, they even have some au courant styles available. i didn't buy anything for myself on this visit, but did manage to find two pairs for my husband, who can never find anything in his size. not that he ever thinks he needs shoes, but i know better. nice addition to downtown summerlin, across the parking lot from trader joe, which means i'll be checking their stock often."
5-star,1,"oh old navy, we have a serious love/hate relationship. i love you because of your cute clothes and deals, but i hate the credit card bills, haha! i would say that i do about 50% of my shopping for both my husband and i here. and i know when we start having children, they'll be in the mix as well! if you're like me and frequent old navy, i highly suggest getting their credit card. you seriously save so much money! i love old navy for the basics - solid dresses, t-shirts, shorts, pants - you know, things that you can layer with a fun sweater or scarf. they're always following the trends, i.e. off the shoulder tops and dresses right now. i know that i'll see you soon, old navy! this store is always well stocked and friendly!"
5-star,1,the best customer service i have ever received at this location. they went out of their way to make sure i knew which jeans were on sale so i could be getting the deal i came into the store for. they also refunded my transaction because i decided to apply for the old navy credit card after i checked out to give me the discount for joining!
1-star,0,"geidi is incredibly rude. was just in looking for my size in pants and bending down looking through the sizes. there was a rack of hanging jeans directly next to me. as she stood there talking loudly to another coworker about something not related to her job apparently she ran out of patience with me bending over looking. so instead of waiting to put back go back jeans, she squeezes in the tiny 2 foot space and smacks me in the head with jeans as she tried to smash them back into the rack. like how rude are you? you couldn't wait 20 seconds for me to stand up and move so you just try to squeeze between me and another rack? nice customer service you snot."
1-star,0,employees are super rude especially the tall blonde hair chick. i walk in little past 9 and there is 20 people still in the store but she wants to yell at me that they are closed. never go there again
5-star,1,"perhaps it's because it's a thursday and it isn't very crowded, but this old navy is really well maintained! everything on the tables is folded and sorted...not typical of a clothing retailer these days. added bonus: we were greeted several times throughout the store...not just when we entered. all-in-all, probably the best old navy i've been in...though, the true test would be to come during peak shopping time."
1-star,0,"i am boycotting this old navy, and old navy in general after a recent visit to this store. i was shocked at their customer service or lack-there-of."
2-star,0,"decent selection, but the selling process is so so slow. no busy parents have time to wait hours to sell a few items. the staff are not good at giving a reasonable time estimate. the store is messy and the staff are not very professional. it kind of doesn't end up being worth it if you want to sell items. and some of the items for sale are over priced if you consider the prices you can get brand new items for if you shop sales."
1-star,0,"do not recommend simply because the staff is beyond rude. i dropped a bucket of clothes off at 1045 with the estimated wait time being an hour. i returned around 12:15 and my things still were not ready which was totally fine. however the woman at the front didn't even acknowledge o was standing there. she didn't even turn around to look at me. finally she said ""last name"" still without having looked at me. i told her my name and she couldn't find my bin. i located it and she told me it would need about ten more min. i went back to my car and gave them a good 15 min before returning. when i did the same thing happened. no acknowledgement. i told her my last name again. the woman acted like she had never seen me although this was our third encounter in a matter of 2 1/2 hours. she then said ten more min and with explanation walked off. when i entered the final time they threw my bin on the floor and told me how much they could offer all the while being rude. the place smells horrible and the staff is so increasingly unpleasant."
1-star,0,"been here a few times and have found some good deals. however, every time i go the staff is incredibly unprofessional. their first goal is definitely not customer service. have consigned twice with them, and the second time when i returned to pick up the remainder of my clothes, i found they had given them to someone else. there were a couple of phone calls made but never resolved. and they never even cared for it to be resolved. ok if you want to buy some clothes here, but never consign here!"
3-star,0,"this shop is a great resource for all families. they have great deals and a lot of toys in excellent condition, as well as clothes. i bought most of my little one's pajamas at this store. pjs are something that can be so expensive new, the footie ones run about $3-4 here. as other reviewers stated, the clothes are organized by colors for some ungodly reason, so it will take some time to find the size you need. as others have mentioned, the customer service is not top notch here. employees are often having inappropriate personal conversions on the sales floor. they haven't necessarily been rude to me, but not friendly or extremely helpful. one day i purchased a pair of shoes for my son at the store. when i purchased them, the elastic was broken, i returned them without a problem. the next time i went in i spotted the broken shoes back in the shoe bucket. so, that's what kind of service professionals you're dealing with here. one final piece of advice, check the amazon price on toys before you leave the store. there was one instance that i saw a bouncy chair for sale in the store and it was the same price with free shipping on amazon."
4-star,1,"i've been here quite a few times and never had a problem here, though i don't go for the customer service- it's not nordstrom's. i will agree they don't offer much for clothing and other various items you might be selling them but then again they need to sell it as well. heck, i bought a like new bumbo seat for $10 and a play bouncer for $35. go ahead and spend $40 for your bumbo and $180 for your play bouncer....seriously. the older kids clothes- like 3 and up- aren't terribly great but i've found a few things, especially shoes, at good prices. and i've been to that shop in the park road shopping center- can you say full price? no, my child doesn't wear ralph lauren- so if you want that go pay full price somewhere else. they have good finds, but just like the goodwill, you're not going to find the same thing each time. oh, i'd also like to ad i bought a like new pack n play there for $30. you can't beat that- really."
1-star,0,after visiting once upon a child 2 years ago and having horrible service i decided to give it another try. i had some great stuff to sell and needed winter things for my children. i walked in 5 girls stood behind the counter not one offered to help. when i finally spoke the girl that came to help let me know she didn't want to. i nearly had to beg for a pen. she told me it would be 30 minutes. i shopped around literally bumping into the workers who were chatting all over the store. the same girl asked me more than 10 times in the almost 2 hrs i waited if i wanted to checkout. i explained 3 times i was still waiting and several people had came after me and now left. the girl resonded they were really busy. ummm...you are talking and one out of 5 is going through the buy bins and she stops to talk to everyone of the other workers every 2 minutes. they were slow and rude and constantly wispered and gave nasty looks. when they paid for my stuff the girl pretty much threw my money down. i laid everything i was going to buy down. i will never return!
1-star,0,"no matter how often i'm there, the staff is horribly rude - not just to me but to every customer. if i ever find another place to take children's items, i will not return. there is no excuse for the ugly attitude and behavior to everyone."
1-star,0,"nothing overly nice, about the same as a yard sale, but pricier. they only give you a third of what they plan to sell it for. so don't plan on making any money selling to them. staff is rude & snotty with ""comments"". while my sister has had very good luck with the store in her state, the pineville and matthews locations, i would not go into again. especially pineville. they have always have an excuse why they can't ""accept"" something. i swear i think they read off a list under the counter. why are they in business? maybe they don't want to buy top end stuff and would rather have a junky store. try some of the other locations in charlotte before this one."
1-star,0,"being someone who has a little toddler sister and a mother who loves buying new clothes for her i was super excited when i learned about stores like once upon a child or kidtokid; who take gently used baby clothes and give you cash! from the beginning my mother told me not to expect a lot of money from these stores. that i'd be lucky if i made 20 dollars even with a bag full of nice clothes. so on my first trip to kidtokid on park road i didn't expect much. i was aiming for maybe $15 dollars. i brought a shopping bag worth of stuff that i had washed, dried and even ironed the night before. but on my first trip to kidtokid i made $22 dollars! i was so excited i decided to keep doing this every couple of months when my sister would grow out of her clothes. my next trip to kidtokid i made $20 dollars. and on my third trip i made $15. a couple of months later i decided to give once upon a child a try. i had read on other websites that they are horrible and have rude employees and don't give you crap for your clothes. but like i said before i don't have very high expectations when i try to sell my used baby clothes or baby equipment. so i decided to make a trip to once upon a child one afternoon with huge bag worth of baby clothes. i arrived at once upon a child at around 12:00pm. i immediately noticed that the store is dark and dated. when i finally got the attention of one of the ladies in the front they told me how it works and everything and said my clothes would be reviewed and done by 1:30pm. i've never had to wait longer than 45 minutes at kidtokid, but i decided to waste time at carolina place mall. i got back to once upon a child around 1:45pm to figure out that my clothes still hadn't even been reviewed yet. they weren't even in the process of reviewing my clothes. so i ended up walking around the store for another 45 minutes! that didn't even bother me to much until i got to the front and the lady told me they only took one of my items. that the clothes were adorable but they were a tad bit wrinkled so to throw them in the dryer again and then bring them back. she literally had the nerve of taking one of my clothing items and gave me $2.15! like i said before i never have high expectations when i try to sell these clothes but two dollars and fifteen cents is insulting. there should be a minimum amount that they give you of at least $5.00. so i could of at least walked out of that freakin' store with enough to buy a frappuccino. it was an awful experience. the ladies weren't rude but they weren't that friendly either. and that i had to wait that long amount of time weren't friendly either. and to literally take one of my clothing items and give me two dollars was terrible. i wasted my gas and my time. i'm going to keep giving my business to kidtokid on park road. the girls that work there are usually friendly. the store is pretty and has way way better clothes then once upon a child. and i've never had to wait longer than 45 minutes. don't sell your clothes at once upon a child, go to kidtokid!"
3-star,0,"one of 2 locations in the charlotte area if you're looking for inexpensive slightly used kids clothing, toys, shoes, strollers, or pretty much anything baby....this is your place! they also purchase your used baby equipment, clothes, etc if it's in good condition. check them out, sometimes you can find pretty good steals if your timing is right."
5-star,1,"i bought a bike from oxygen bike company two years ago (great experience dealing with chris, the manager). i recently had a fall after dodging someone who fell off their skateboard. my bike handle bent inwards. i brought it in to see if it could be fixed. jeremy fixed it right up (handle bar wasn't broken), and checked to make sure everything else was running fine. great chatting with jeremy and jacob (nice to see chris there too). great people working here. p.s. shawn was also great over e-mail exchanges."
5-star,1,"i honestly don't know what i would do without this awesome local bike shop, i have been in there at least 10 times this winter alone to get both of my bicycles serviced. winter biking is rough on all the bike parts but it is so incredibly rewarding and fun. thanks to oxygen's staff, no type of weather stops me from getting onto my bicycle and loving it."
5-star,1,"excellent service and nothing better than free tune ups for life. i came here around february to purchase a road bike as i wanted to get into road cycling for exercise. chris helped me out and was extremely knowledgable in picking out a bike that fit my needs and my budget. he also took the time and patience to explain things to me (as i was completely new to road bikes) and answer all my questions. we probably spent over an hour going through different bikes and adjusting it to my needs. i really appreciated that help. since then i've dropped by the shop to pick up some additional gear and once to ask about an issue i was with the bike. they showed me what the problem was, what caused it, and fixed it immediately. their service is what keeps me coming back. as mentioned above, when you buy a bike from the shop you get free tune ups for the life of the bike - which is obviously a great bonus. if you at all feel intimidated about the bike culture, don't be. just visit oxygen and they'll guide you through everything and eventually you'll be riding away extremely pleased with your decision."
5-star,1,"in september of 2014, at a blowout sale on cne grounds i bought my first bike i had purchased in 14 years. i remember meeting one of the guys from oxygen there. he was extremely professional, friendly, approachable and knowledgeable. my three interactions i've had with all the folks at oxygen have been positive. they give me free tune ups for life with the purchase of the bike. in the spring of 2015 they fixed a cable on my bike for free, and today (sept 2015) i had an informative feedback interaction with one of the mechanics while dropping my bike off for the yearly tune up. good guys, with good knowledge in a small shop, but worth the time checking them out and doing business with them. they're just too far away from where i live :)"
5-star,1,"a friend gave me a folding bike that he hadn't used in a very long time. i went to oxygen bike co. because it was local and the yelp reviews were good. i came in expecting that the bike needed a complete tune up. chris pumped up the tires, tested it out and assured me it was in fine condition. he made adjustments on the bike so that it would fit me. it's been years since i've been on a bike. chris was fantastic in helping select a new lock, helmet and even installed my new water bottle cage on the spot. i noticed that staff helping other customers while i was there were also friendly. glad this is my local bike shop. great customer service."
5-star,1,my wife and i just got a child seat for the front of my bike. these guys were awesome! they explained the different options to me and focused especially on safety (which i appreciate as a father). great customer service! we'll be back!
4-star,1,"this place is really great! i finally came for a tune up (haven't had one since i purchased my bike). they were right on time in terms of estimating when it would be done. i would've preferred it to be a bit sooner, but it's a lifetime of tune ups if you purchase your bike at their shop. lifetime of tune ups! how amazing is that? i'm sure they have plenty of bikes in the queue no matter what. friendly bunch of guys who work here."
4-star,1,my husband bought a good quality used bike here and was very happy with his experience. i thought the customer service was the friendliest i've seen in a bike shop. items looked reasonably priced too.
2-star,0,"it's a nice new shop and i met the owner who was friendly. the service level was pretty low however. i called and asked if they had pedals and shoes in my size and was assured that unless i was a size 15, the had me covered. also that it would only take 15 minutes to install and i would be on my way. delighted, i arrived at the shop 15 mins later to discover they didn't have anything close to my size (8,9,10) or even equivalent in women's sizes. the friendly shop keep and owner (shawn/sean) explained that they will order and have my size the next two businesses days and would phone me - a week later no call so i phoned - spoke to the owner once again who didn't remember anything and said shoes wouldn't be coming in for another week *maybe*. oh well, guess they are still working on the kinks and customer service."
1-star,0,"sorry to say this location is closed. despite their facebook, website, etc. i went yesterday (closed) and today (still closed). i called the north las vegas shop and was called a liar by the idiot working there. he said there was a clear sign in the window. noooooo.....if there was, i wouldn't have returned to find it closed again! bye, pharmacy."
5-star,1,"5 stars. this skate shop has some of the friendliest, knowledgeable, no-ego guys around. my daughter loves skateboarding and each time we go here they are super cool to her, talk to her about what she's looking for, always helping her find just the right equipment, deck size, etc. she went for their prez day sale a couple weeks ago and they were sold out of the regular pharmacy boards so they gave her a better board at the sale price. i went today to surprise my daughter with new wheels, trucks, bearings, etc., for a deck she'd bought there a couple months ago. the guy working (whose name i spaced now) was super friendly, helpful and accommodating. he pulled out a couple different colored wheels to see which would look better, found some new, standard trucks they'd just gotten in to save me a few dollars, and helped my pick out a new pink protec skate helmet for her. he offered ideas of skate parks we might not know about and a place across town that does skate camps. he also threw in a handful of skate stickers for her board, which i know she'll be super stoked about. i was pretty impressed by his affable demeanor and willingness to answer all my 146,684 (give or take) questions. would def recommend pharmacy skateboard shop and i'm sure will be returning again sooner than later if my daughter has anything to do with it."
5-star,1,"i'm sponsoring a needy local child for christmas who asked for a skateboard. i have no experience skateboarding, so i wasn't sure what to expect when i went to pharmacy. i explained my situation to bernard, who proceeded to find exactly what i needed. bernard was very helpful, friendly, and efficient. good listener and problem solver -- model employee! walked out with a skateboard ideal for my child's age and experience (beginner), as well as safety equipment. thanks pharmacy -- you are going to make a kid very happy this christmas!"
1-star,0,"they seem nice but after purchasing a set of skate bearings, i try to return them and find out they don't take returns.they have lost my future business."
5-star,1,"they made me an awesome complete. great customer service and very informative about trucks, wheels, and bearings. the pharmacy board shop is great for skaters and for new skaters. definitely coming back."
5-star,1,foreman was awesome. very helpful to put together boards for my 2 kids. well definitely come back again and highly recommended.
5-star,1,"this place is awesome, and always helpful! great place to go for skaters and safe to send people here for gifts if you are a skater. you'll love whatever youll get and theres always people there to answer your question or do whatever they can to. faithful pharmacy shopper!(:"
4-star,1,the guy was very helpful and friendly. it was our sons first real board and he made it fun for him. the ten percent off for checking in helped a lot. i forgot how expensive these things are!
5-star,1,bernard(the boardrista) was super helpful and was happy to answer all of my questions with no hesitation. the shop itself was well equip and inviting with great deals and prices. the shop was busy but all of my needs were met. great place and people.
1-star,0,"great board deals, but the staff is super all over the place. i walked in behind a family, the older kid was getting a board, the mom was paying for it and the little brother was swinging his whatever toy around. one cashier was helping the kid get his board while the other guy behind the counter, bernard with the curly long hair, just stood there folding shirts and wouldn't acknowledge me at all, he just kept folding shirts and looking past me and over my head and past me again and then he even proceeded to ask somebody else who came in after me if he needed to open the sunglasses case for them...i kept looking at him hoping he would ask if i needed help, but he kept ignoring me, and it felt super intentional...i know he knew that i needed help because after the mom finished paying she saw that i was waiting and kindly moved over so i could be helped, but unfortunately her son was still talking to the cashier (about dunkin donuts no less) so i walked up to the counter hoping to be helped by bernard, but he still continued to look past me as if i wasn't even there. in fact he never looked at me at all and i had to wait while they all chit-chatted with the family ahead of me (since they all apparently know each other). at this point i was really beginning to feel uncomfortable because i knew i was being ignored. it gets even better though! some kid who was skating came in and started showing the bernard guy some tricks that he'd just filmed and if you couldn't guess, he continued to ignore me as i stood at the counter in his face. all i needed was a size 8 board and some grip, two minutes tops is what it would've taken to help me and i'm not one walk into a store and demand to be helped and waited on, but i do expect to be acknowledged...especially when i'm standing directly across the counter from you. i know i could've simply asked for help, but i felt so unwelcome that i didn't feel comfortable enough to. i ended up leaving with the worst board shop experience ever. it was an easy going and laid back atmosphere, but at the same time not really because it just felt super snobby. it's like, how are you gonna be too stuck up to help the only other person in line (especially when you guys are all just chatting away...that's just rude and unprofessional) and let alone not even greet or acknowledge other customers? it just makes me wanna take my business back to zumies. everyone says support local, support small shops, but whenever i go to smaller local shops like this i'm all but ignored by the employees who act just as stuck up as the girls at pacsun and abercrombie and fitch aka they act like they're above you and too good to help you, whereas at zumies they're actually genuinely nice to you and they actually want to help you find what you need. the blond guy who rang me up was really nice and helpful, but that was the only good experience i had there today. i shouldn't have to wait forever to be acknowledged or helped. please just let your employees know that a little kindness and just even greeting a customer goes such a long way...as does ignoring them. even if they're not yet trained to work a register or ring someone up, they could at least acknowledge customers and ask them if they need any help. it's retail for crying out loud! nobody wants to walk into your shop at the end of a long and stressful workday just to be ignored and treated like an inconvenience. customers are more important to your business than shirts that need folding. you get 1 star because of your monthly deal on boards, but i'm still not sure if i'll be back as it's hard to keep shopping at an establishment where you're treated so horribly."
5-star,1,the employee bernard was super helpful answering all my very basic beginner questions. i felt welcome & was grateful for his very patient manner. i learned a lot about what style of skateboard i prefer.
5-star,1,just came in here to build a deck that i had lying around for a while. both times i have been the staff have been super friendly and helpful. it's also nice to be able to visit a local shop that knows what they're talking about it instead of one of the big mall brands.
5-star,1,"love the pharmacy. it's a small shop so all product lines soft- and hardgoods are tightly selected. these guys don't sell products they wouldn't use themselves. long on competence, knowledge, friendliness. reasonable prices. my vote for best board shop in the valley."
4-star,1,"support local business! now that i've said that, support local business! i almost always try to shop for clothes at local places like this, yes i'm still 14-years-old. pharmacy boardshop has a decent selection of name brand shirts, hoodies, and shoes. they also sell their own brand of t-shirts called, ""pharmacy"" and by the way, the shirts are super soft. like any good skate shop, they have a large selection of skateboards; everything from short decks, long boards, and even a few 80's style pool carving boards which have been making a come back lately. i know some people can get intimated when walking into places like this, but the guys in here are very friendly and eager to help out newbies to the skate community. this place might be a little more pricey than wally-world or other large box stores, but isn't it nice to know you're not feeding the beast?"
5-star,1,"initially came here for the the girl/chocolate ""pretty sweet"" tour signing. realized the location wasn't that bad, i came back to shop for the first time. i returned to take advantage of their $20 board deal (every 20th of the month!). was immediately greeted when i came into the shop. explained what i was looking for, and they hooked it up right away. they also pointed out other sales, including the area for buy one get one free shoes. crazy good selection, staff is cool, and the prices are great!"
5-star,1,i've been going to pharmacy for over a decade and i love this shop. by far the best variety of skate hardgoods and shoes in las vegas. i wouldn't go anywhere else for all of my skate/apperal needs. very knowledgeable customer service too.
5-star,1,"i have to say for a board shop i was given some great customer service. we were instantly greeted when we walked into the store. just for checking in we got a 10% coupon. my boys knew what they wanted already which is abnormal for them. we had already been to the store a few days prior anyway, the kids picked their stuff, there was so much to choose from. they are competitive price wise as well as assortment wise. if my boys need any diamond, huff or hundreds brand accessories, clothes, socks etc i know where i am going to bring them. the hours work with our schedule and the location is prime. the parking lot is a little small but there is always a parking spot. thanks for always having everything we need in your little location. my boys can't wait to go back again!!"
2-star,0,"the place is located in the huge walmart& sams club plaza, directly in front of walmart. pretty easy to find. and its a huge place so parking is never really hard to find. came to this place planning to buy some janoskis (shoes), right when i walked in, someone greeted me and asked me if i needed any help. good start. i ended up finding two pairs in the sale section, one of the workers was really surprised i found a certain pair. i wanted to buy the shoes cash so i said i'll be back. came back 15 minutes later only to find the worker saying i couldn't buy one of the shoes anymore. wtf? apparently one of the shoes wasn't suppose to be on sale? it felt super shady and messed up. i couldn't tell if that was really the reason, or he just wanted to buy if for himself. really bad first impression, don't get me wrong the place has really good merchandise but it was just really really shady on how i couldn't buy the shoes. when 15 minutes earlier i could have bought the shoes without any hassle. i ended up going to suite160 and buying another pair of shoes there. really harsh review but its what it deserves for my visit. this place has some cool things though, i'll be sure to visit again and update."
5-star,1,"what a cool shop with friendly workers. my boyfriend was looking for some shoes before he left town and we pulled up to the store at 8:01. they close at 8:00, but they didn't care and were so nice to let us in and peruse their shop after closing. there is very little women's selection here--just a few pairs of toms--but if you have a sk8terboi in your life and need a good gift, here is a relatively small business option. (i say relative because it is, indeed, a franchise, but only has two or three other locations, vs. pac sun or tilly's or whatever that have thousands.) recommended!"
5-star,1,awesome place! whenever we walk into pharmacy we are greeted and told of what's new and what's on sale. the workers are so friendly every single time we come in. other places sell the same brands but don't offer service unless you look like a millionaire. it's great to go to a shop in vegas where the staff is humble and not so money hungry. definitely a store to check out!
4-star,1,"as far as small local skate shops go, pharmacy is really all we have. they have some cool stuff on the discount rack all the time, but some of their stuff is pricy like the hoodies, shoes, and some jackets. they have a great deal on their blank decks though...every month on the 20th...the blanks are 20.00 bucks, you can't beat that. i like the service also. donnie always takes care of me, but he works at the one off eastern. he knows the gear, culture, and on my birthday he hooked me up with a shirt. i always buy stuff from them."
3-star,0,"relatively new to las vegas, not new to the rest of the west coast, the pharmacy has a wide variety of sporting brands, my favorite being rvca because they suppport young, up and coming artists. they also have a pretty good flux of apparel and goods going on sale. its a cool little shop where you just wanna go and shoot the shit with the employees, who are all skaters themselves, all day long. * off the strip, non-casino"
1-star,0,"worst store ever! super rude costumer service. will never go back there. lady at the counter, think it was the owner was very rude. asked her if she could help me in finding a size 2 in a style. after rolling her eyes and aggressively grabbing some keys, said yes, let me check. total attitude. after that, i just left."
5-star,1,"holy cow! why has it taken us a year to discover this place? if it hadn't been for the rain today, my husband and i may never had set foot into this shop--- it would have been our loss! men's and women's clothing that you won't find in the chain stores, some fabulous accessory lines, and the cutest onesies i've ever seen! if you are looking for something to wear that won't be on every other person in tour office, this is the place to go. price point vary, which is another thing we loved. she has several lines of the most adorable dresses i've seen in a long time. i can't wait to go back!"
5-star,1,"the simple sign and tucked away location has kept this place a secret from me. while strolling around town square, without any place in mind, i came across this shop. i thought my love of frills was excessive, but this shop puts my wildest imaginations to shame. some shirts looked like they grabbed a hot glue gun and went crazy with rhinestones. avoiding the sparkles for men, they had plenty more simple, yet special designs. the prices are steep, but they are no more than full price banana republic or express. also you are guaranteed that you will not see everyone running around in the same or similar looking items. they also carry an even amount of sizes that spans the spectrum. sometimes, boutiques lean more towards the model demographic, but there were a good supply of s to xxl."
5-star,1,"more of this please. vegas has few independent boutiques for finding a unique accessory, charming gift or special little t-shirt, but you can find all three and more here! i stumbled across this shopping find while wandering around town square. it is a bit out of the way (next to pete's piano bar), but just a glance out of the corner of my eye was all it took for me to want to take a closer look. they were featuring some creative, colorful tees designed by a la artist. there were a couple vegas-themed ones that i had to see up close. in addition to having some cute clothing pieces, there are a slew of trinkets, doo dads, and other fab delights, just the things you would love to give your best pal (or keep for yourself!) i even spied some one-of-a-kind watches. there is a men's section too. the vibe is a little bit street culture with a dash of feminine sass. definitely the type of indie spot i would love to see more of!"
5-star,1,"i have stumbled upon greatness in this boutique that belongs on melrose or on the moon instead of town square. i am hooked! the clothes are stylish and reasonably priced considering they are so fashion forward and so well made. phenom has something to make everyone look good. hats from la., t-shirts with funny slogans and beautiful women on them jeans button down tops going out clothes jewelry belts bags scarfs colorful watches and a million other things i can't remember. oh, my favorite is a little change purse made out of a freakin cassette tape! how cool is that? i want everything in this damn store! when my friend and i lose thirty pounds i promised both of us fatties a shopping spree here. vegas yelpers, this store is where it's at so if you want to dress to impress or just want to look good get your arse down to phenom before i buy the whole place!"
5-star,1,"what a fun store! it's so nice to find something unique after all these chains. the merchandise fits really well, and i'm betting that i won't see these clothes on anyone else around here. this is a great place to shop..."
4-star,1,"pink buffalo you are adorable. this is a little boutique in the shopping center where holley's cuppa is. it's right on cimarron and blue diamond behind the bank hiding. after grabbing some fro yo at poppy's i came in to check out their clothes since i had seen good reviews on yelp. i wasn't disappointed. this shop has some really cute items. they have dresses, tops, skirts, shorts, jewelry, and some purses as well. they have about 10 rack of clothes divided by color and they even have a rack for plus size. my only issue is they are so tiny so they only have a few of each item. it's hard to find something in an extra large. i've gonna back since and tried on some dresses with my friend. she was looking for a dress for the wedding and couldn't find her size. the lady was trying so hard to help us. she probably grabbed every dress in the place for us but still not luck. why not 5 stars? well, the weirdest thing was another lady just chilling in the corner with her shoes off. she wasn't very inviting. also i still haven't bought anything. i'm gonna keep trying."
5-star,1,"great neighborhood botique that has super cute clothing and accessories at affordable prices! i bought a super cute little cami and wallet when i was in last that i get compliments on all the time. good variety of clothes and sizes, the shop is nicely decorated, easy to shop in and items easy to find. definitely will be back, loved it all!!"

1-star,0,walked in and couldn't even get a hello. the lady behind the counter was to busy on her ipad to notice me. walked around the store for a minute and then left. wouldn't buy anything from her if i did see something i liked. she ruined it.

5-star,1,"super cute shop! a must go for those in need of cute clothes and accessories who are trying to shop local. the prices are very affordable. the tops i got were around $20 and the cute ring was $7. interestingly enough, they really do have something for everyone. my 62 year old other got some cute stuff along with my friend's 9 year old daughter. they even have plus sizes. cute items for all!"
4-star,1,"went to pink buffalo for the opening and loved what i found!! such a cute store with so much to choose from! so many different sizes, i'm a bigger girl so selection sometimes is minimal for me. this was a pleasant surprise. i will definitely go back next time i need something to wear for sure! great staff too! love the place!! thanks!"

5-star,1,"i was in town visiting family so i wanted to make sure i checked it this spot out while i was near. i heard about pound for pound shoes online in a few of my sneakers groups and heard nothing but good things. i stopped by early afternoon and was greeted as soon as walked in the store. i met brendan the owner, he was a super nice dude and very knowledgable of shoes. overall i spent a little over an hour and left the store with 4 pairs of kicks at a very reasonable price. i have and will refer friends here. i found out they have a location in la and am traveling there in very soon and am going to have to plan to make a stop to see what else i can pick for my shoe collection. keep up the good work guys, till next time."
5-star,1,"*review for online store only* this was my first actual purchase of jordan's and i was very skeptical not only ordering online but about the authenticity as well. we all know that some people online will price rape you for the popular jordans and i was definitely not interested in paying over $500 so seeing that i found my shoes for a decent value, i was impressed. i was not sure as to what size i would be because i am a true 8.5 in women's sneakers so i emailed the store and they responsed promptly and gave me assurance that they guarantee their products. they also were clear and correct about what size would be best for me. i went ahead and ordered my low concords and they arrived today with 2 day shipping in immaculate condition. i will continue to purchase again. thank you pound for pound."
1-star,0,"i have sold a couple of shoes on consignment with pound for pound without a hitch. so i decided to bring in a bit mor following trip to the store as it is far from avondale. so i brought in 6 pairs they sold 2 which i went to pick up my check for i call 2 weeks later none of the others sold per brandon. a week later i called and 2 more pairs sold and over the phone brandon clearly stated you can come in and pickup your check for both pairs. i get there and he tells me they paid me out for one of the other pairs and so he can only pay me for one of the shoes. this is a bold face lie i never received payment for one of the pairs. me working at a bank know the procedures about how to get this looked at quickly. instead he says my cpa will review my activity and i will call you in a week when i know for sure we did or didn't pay you. it's as simple as logging into online banking and if you paid the check amount and my name should be on the check with 20% deducted very simple math. he gets offended and says i'll let you know in a week that's all j can do. so because of his short comings as an owner, manager and business man i'm left to wonder about my shoes and money. solely because they don't have a good system in place. i advise all shoe lovers beware they are not equipped to handle business and definitely not my shoes anymore. needless to say i will never trust brandon or pound for pound with my sneaks again."
5-star,1,"the best az has to offer when it comes to sneakers. weather new or used they gotchu covered! new releases or previous release you've missed out on. prices are decent and market value. this isn't tour local footlocker so if you're looking for older,limited,hype,exclusives this is the place to go. staff is friendly and will explain the shoes or talk sneakers if that's what you want. store has a dope set up and is separated by sizes so you can strictly look at the shoes in your size range. highly recommend it if it's what you're looking for."
5-star,1,"all that pipe in there just gets me excited...and by pipe, i mean the amazing pipe racks that the shoes are displayed on. some people have issues with money and the pricing of this place but hey its consignment, look it up in the dictionary. no one forces you to sell your shoes there or buy. this group has been always friendly to me and they also work with the community."
5-star,1,"top notch shoe boutique. if you're into limited sneakers look no further. great selection, friendly helping staff and descent prices. best shoe spot i've been to in az hands down."
5-star,1,killer kicks. sum sexy thangs i never seen b4. chingas of lebron samples and other rare shits. owner bnapes is courtois kind and helfpul and has many pretty tattoos. this shop is a must for sneaker hedz and they just opened a store in la #p4pknockoutpunch
1-star,0,"shoe lovers beware. these guys will act all friendly and act as if they want to help with the sneaker community. but that's not the case. the skinny i met these guys a few years ago at several different shoe shows (dxc heated sole) i thought we had built a relationship that was friendly. i purchased (2 shoes) and i sold a few pairs of shoes through them which they charge 20% no problem they sold my shoes and said they would have someone call me to pick up a check well after a few weeks i noticed my shoes had sold but no call i waited another week before i decided to call, they lied and said they just sold the day before and i was going to get a call soon. i went to pick up check i noticed my other shoes had sold as well but they didn't tell me either i let it go as i got my money but felt like they were not telling people as they didn't have enough money to cover checks,they have no policy in place for holding a check and they seemed to get upset when i asked about it. i would call in to ask if they can relist my shoes on their instagram page brandon seemed to have an issue with and said he would have someone look into it but nothing was done. god forbid you go in there and ask about prices being so high they will give you this attitude about prices being set by customers when in fact they recommend pricing as they want to get as much as they can. there is always 2-3 staff hanging out in there and makes it awkward when ur the only shopper and they are just standing there looking at you. please be careful of the services they offer, they let me know that they can do a legit check on a shoe for me (make sure they aren't fakes or variants) i thought that was great as there is a lot of fake shoes out here. i finally worked out a deal for a very limited an expensive shoe that i needed to get a legit check so i had the guy meet me there, we go in and it checks out and as i'm closing the deal, brandon offered him more money that i was able to give. no apology no nothing just a s@$t eating smile like he won the lottery. he also was boastful online about it as to throw it more in my face. real questionable business ethics, i won't do business with this store again."
5-star,1,always what i get from privity boutique! so easy online if i can't get down to the store too. spoiler alert. . .lots of christmas gifts purchased here!
1-star,0,all of the clothes are either juniors or petite sizes - beware. i am normally between a 6 and an 8 and i couldn't even get my arms in a shirt that was xl. she does not tell you this up front and does not offer refunds - only exchanges for other tiny clothes. do not shop here unless you actually are petite. or in junior high school.
1-star,0,"just a heads up, the item i received was not like the photo. i ordered a size large because i wanted a looser fit, but the dress was tight and the sleeves were really short and tight. a medium is typically loose on me, so i was shocked. the model must have been just 100 lbs., which would be valuable information for anyone shopping on this site. the worst thing is that i paid for shipping and now i have to pay for return shipping. i asked the owner why i had to pay for return shipping since the dress was misrepresented on the web site...she did not even respond to me. i will never shop at this site again and will do everything i can to get the word out on social media about what happened. not responding is just rude...and it's just bad business."
5-star,1,the owner is amazing and sweet. i spent a fortune here and i wanted to keep buying more. what started out as an online order (i didn't know they were in az) ended up being my new favorite store! i'm so happy i sum led across their pinterest posts. i'm hooked and have told all my friends!
1-star,0,i purchased a dozen or so different jewelry and clothing items from this store for my wife for christmas. like a lot of husbands it was last minute (dec 23rd). i knew very well that my wife would probably need to exchange some items for different sizes or styles but made the mistake of not asking specifically about their return/exchange policy. it's now january 5th and my wife goes in to make the exchanges and is told she can not because there policy is 7 days. they never told me this or mentioned it at all. i was glad to have supported a local small business but now i'm just thoroughly disappointed. unless you are there trying on the items i would stay far away from this store and if you are buying a gift don't even think about it.
1-star,0,"don't buy here if there's a chance you will need to return or exchange something. to start off, my 13 year old daughter and her grandmother (my mother) came into this store sunday, november 19th. the store was getting close to closing, but they were allowed to shop and purchase their items. my daughter asked if she could try her items on, but she was told the fitting room was closed, and she would need to check out. the next day, she tried on her items, and one pair of pants she purchased did not fit properly. i told her to put the pants back in the bag, with the receipt and we will exchange them. they literally sat in my closet the entire time. we came in last night(within the normal 14 day exchange policy) and the store did not carry the next size up pants, so she chose other items to purchase. when we were ready to exchange the pants (and purchase additional items), we were asked where the tag was that came on the pants. there were multiple other manufacture tags on the pants, i did not notice the tag with the sku number was missing. my daughter said she did not remove any tags on her own, and she was unsure where the tag was either. the cashier went to speak to her manager (i assume) sammy. sammy came up to the register, did not even greet us and speak kindly of their policies about missing tags, she abruptly blurted out ""how can i exchange these pants without the tag?!"" i explained we did not remove any tags. could it have possibly fell off or maybe the pants were sold to her without the tag? who knows. i told her the exact same pants are on the wall, if she could please just use that tag to scan and do the exchange. (as i said earlier, all other tags were still on the pants, this was the only missing tag). sammy started rudely saying, ""what is all this white stuff on here?"" then she started lint rolling the pants with tape. the pants were black with white lint. they were in perfect condition! she looked at the pants up and down over and over, as if trying to find a reason to tell me she couldn't do the exchange. she said she can do the exchange this one time. the cashier gave us all purchased items in a bag, without a receipt. i asked for the receipt, then she printed it, with final sale on it even for the new items we had just purchased. i asked why does this say final sale? sammy told me because i returned an item without a tag. i asked what about the 3 other items i just bought? she told me it's all final sale because the pants i returned have pet hair and a stain. i told her that was impossible and to show me the stain. she was not able to point out the stain, but pointed out the wrinkle on the pants that sits behind the knee saying it was worn. i told her it was not worn, if it was, why would all the other tags still be on the pants? i said she tried it on, so its not our fault if the pants have a small wrinkle, that to me is insane to even point that out! she said it was her store policy and i could not get a normal receipt for the new items. i took her name and told her i was contacting corporate. this is terrible customer service and being accused of being dishonest. they will never get my business again."
1-star,0,don't ever work here. they will talk about you behind your back and be very rude towards you. i was told to come in to get my last check and all i got were dirty looks and my check. manager didn't even walk out to hand me my check. they will fire you for no absolute reason!!!
1-star,0,i always hit this store when i'm at the mall but the girls that work here are always so so rude! even when i smile at them i get nothing but a rude a** smirk. it has happened on multiple occasions not just once wish they would really think through who they hire!
1-star,0,"this is mainly for the service/employees- im giving them 1 star. i shop here a good amount of times & everytime i'm in the girls are so rude, don't even acknowledge you and always act annoyed. i've been seeing this as a trend so thought it would be good to post a review about it. coming out of the dressing room, my friend and i were talking to the girl and she didn't say 1 word back to us, she ignored us and gave us a blank, nasty stare like we were some animals and she wanted nothing to do with us. then we go to cashier to check out and we were looking at nail polish and she told us not to touch it? mind you, we are 24 years old not 15 we are actually shopping. now, i act smart back to them since everytime i go in they are rude. it happens every time. maybe the owner should give them a little chat on how to treat paying customers."
1-star,0,very disappointed with the employees at this location. after shopping for almost an hour i went to the dressing room only to be told that the store was closed. none of the employees bothered to announce that they would be closing soon or even mentioned it when i asked them for help. total waste of my time and terrible customer service.
1-star,0,"this store has an awful exchange policy, i had my receipt and tag piece was on the clothing, price must if fallen off, would not even exchange it! i will never shop there again ! policy is horrible!"
2-star,0,"i love this store and everything about it the clothes are so cute and very very cheap for the quality which is amazing. i usually have a great experience here but this time i had bought something little and the cashier asked if i wanted a bag and i said yes and she cashed me out, then she put my item on the counter with an unopened bag on top of it and just walked away.. she knew i wanted a bag because she put one on the counter but she had an attitude because i wanted such a small item in a bag because i like putting my other bags in one to keep track better. over all she was rude and didn't have the greatest customer service"
4-star,1,"dd went back-to-school shopping in here. it's a large store with a lot of merchandise, but they do a pretty good job of keeping things spaced out and uncluttered. there were many fashionable items for the low (think forever 21). if you're shopping here make sure you are certain about your purchase. some of their sale items have a no return policy; other's you have to return within a week or so. and there is no cash back here. when i was checking out, the employee asked if i shopped for myself too. girl... this is definitely a teen-to-20-something store; don't let them fool you into believing anything else. this store is located on the top floor, on the side of the mall that the thirsty lion is on (but up one floor)."
5-star,1,"sylvester was very helpful in helping my son find the right tux for his homecoming dance. the prices are very reasonable and i especially appreciate the deal he gave me on the shoes. also, i returned the tux a day late and was forgiven a late fee. i would definitely recommend this store for tuxedo rental."
5-star,1,i just wanted to thank readytux. the price alone let us get the other things we needed..and your staff made the fitting painless for us. thank you soo much.
5-star,1,amazing services. matched the tux to the dress perfectly. we could not of been happier. thank yall so much!!! married 11/9/15 sylvester and brendon yall are awesome sauce
5-star,1,"ready tux is a great little shop with quote friendly service. the owner sylvester helped me personally, and ordered me the perfect jacket for my wedding. he then surprised it by having it tailored and ready to go in no time at all. i'd recommend checking it out"
1-star,0,the guy was really fast at selling the product and did not even explain how the measurements would fit. all he wanted was fast cash. i'm an unsatisfied customer and will never shop at ready tux ever again. bottom line do not shop there.
1-star,0,"i am so relieved this business finally has it's own yelp. i tried looking for it last year and found nothing. i myself did not rent from here, but there was a wedding in our family and my dad and 2 other uncles decided to rent their tuxes from here. initially i heard the terrible experience my uncle first had and i didn't really think anything of it until it was my dad's turn. so my dad went in for his initial fitting and the gentleman who helped him out told him it will be ready on friday to try for a second fitting, unfortunately my dad was too busy to come in and hoped 1 fitting should be sufficient. contrary to belief it was not! the day of the wedding my dad puts on the pants and they are way too short. the pants were above his ankle. i initially thought this was unacceptable especially the fact the prices here are pretty standard for the tux rental industry and the fact they are located at the boulevard mall. i was so upset i myself returned the tux after because i wanted to speak to the gentleman and potentially get a refund. well immediately walking i saw the sign at the cash register, no refunds. but i sure did try to get a word with the employee who assisted my dad and uncle and he sure was stiff as a brick. i even gave him a spiel on fitting people properly because i worked in retail for 4 years, so i definitely know a thing or two about that. all he could say to me was if he had come in the day before, it could have been fixed. uhh no, this should only take 1 try not 2! basically do not come here!"
4-star,1,"my go-to grocery store. always has great deals, fresh produce, and is never crowded. i buy most of my meats here because they have fantastic club packs. my only complaint so far is that during my last visit i was more or less bullied into signing up for a pc mastercard. i told the staff member 6 or 7 times that no, i did not want to sign up, but i finally caved when he said he would follow me and fill it out as i shopped. staff needs to step down on the persuasiveness as it became very uncomfortable for me."
4-star,1,"this is the closest store to marriot couryard and riadissan. it is great that it opens late until 11 pm. i would say they are similar to a walmart. for a traveler if you forgot any necessities from home, this is a good place to go and not that far from these 2 hotels in calgary nor the airport. it is super convenient as there are no other grocery stores near the hotels."
4-star,1,get groceries every week. there is a good life fitness here too. now they let you order your groceries online and pick them up.
1-star,0,you stand in electronics for a half hour i finnaly find an employee ask to get a game she says and employee took the key home so you can't get your game i'm like wtf the manager doesn't have a fucking key like this store is bullshit all the staff don't know anything i have to show customers where shit is and i don't even. work their
2-star,0,"my expectations are always so low when i go into superstore and this visit was no exception. here is a quick summation of what to expect. me in aisle 5 (baking) scanning the shelves for vegetable shortening. *sigh* none to be found. *idea* runs to aisle 4 (oils) still nothing. *sees a worker, first one in 20 mins* runs to her... me: hi there, do you know what aisle has vegetable shortening? worker: aisle 5 me: checked, wasn't there. worker: aisle 4 me: i checked there too. worker: *embarrassed* oh, sorry, i don't know what vegetable shortening is. *scurries away* me: *shocked emoji-face* if you like reading the small print on documents, this is the place for you! under closer speculation, about 80% of the price tags have ""when you buy in groups of 2"" or other some other catch. the reason i still go to superstore is usually under duress of my household."
4-star,1,"this place was a great find. they have a huge produce section. my only gripe was not everything was that easy to find, but i could find most everything if i did some searching."
4-star,1,"why didn't anyone write a review yet for this ? were you all waiting for me :p . i see a lot crowd visiting this canadian store including me. anyway glad to be the first to review it. it is at a very convenient location which is near by to calgary transit and has ample of parking space. i visit this place very often for my groceries. they have different sections and one for asian too. so i could get many of the necessary goods(indian groceries) which are not available at other places for such a low price. even they have pretty many options in rice. always the prices are much lower when compared to anyother store either in downtown or surrounding area. vegetables are fresh except on few days.( usually they refill during fridays). they have lot of varities in snacks,bread,cakes,seafood,chicken. we get here chinese okra, bottle gaurd, indian karela, eggplant, indian okra and many other distinct varieties in all sections which makes it unique from other stores. never to worry about the price as it is always the best price on any good. some suggestions: 1. rice- nessa brand is good and cheaper to. comes to $9 for 5kg which has a good quality than other brands. go on weekdays if you want to get one. this is a very fast moving one. 2. you get coconut water here in cans. 3. carry your own bags as they charge you for the bags they give you to carry the purchased goods. sorry for throwing light mostly on asian goods because i got to try only those. good that, it leaves some points for others to review on :)."

5-star,1,"omg! i searched all over for a wig like the one i had purchased over a year ago and ruined by cutting it myself. i have bought wigs at the swap meet for over $200 (lowest price available there anymore!) and just did not want to spend that much again. walked into this store (my husband remembered where it was), found the exact wig to replace mine (well, well under $200!) and ms. equilla spent over 1/2 hour carefully trimming and shaping my wig. the store is clean and professional looking; the staff is warm, friendly, and talented; and i will go back often and tell my friends. i think finding this location again was my holiday miracle!"
1-star,0,"i went here to get a wig for a costume but the prices were too high. i was shocked at how much they charge but if they can get away with that, good for them."
5-star,1,"last year i was looking for a wig for my halloween costume. thinking i'd only wear it once, i didn't want to spend a lot of money. however, i couldn't find anything that would work at the costume stores (i was going as ginger from gilligan's island). someone recommended reese's wigs so i grudgingly went there, expecting to spend a lot of money. when i got there and started talking to the salesperson about what i needed i was pleasantly surprised. she was very pleasant and accommodating, showing me some options that were much more affordable than i expected. sure, it was more than i had originally expected to spend, but it fit well, didn't itch the crap out of me, and looked great! oh, and guess what? i pulled the wig out of the box a year later, brushed it out (have you ever tried to brush those cheap costume wigs? ugh!!) and it looks brand new! i am now wearing it a second time for this year's halloween party. i'm sure i'll get quite a few more wearings out of it. if i ever need another wig again, reese's wigs will be the first place i go!"
1-star,0,bought a wig and was not told while buying that they do not accept returns. 30 minutes after my purchase i found a wig down the street i liked. they would not allow me to return the wig even though i just purchased it 30 minutes ago.
5-star,1,"a month and a half ago my 74 year old mother's scalp was severely burned by a negligent hairstylist. every week that passed by, more and more of her hair fell out. her confidence disappeared and she was emotionally wrecked. finally mom made the decision to get a wig. a friend of hers recommended reese's. both mom and i were a little nervous about walking into a wig shop, but the second we opened the door of reese's we were greeted by equilla west and the discomfort disappeared. equilla guided us through the process of selecting a a wig that matched my moms style and price. she even helped mom with fitting and trimming the wig to mom's desired length. while looking around the shop, i had the pleasure of speaking with reese dossa (the owner) and his mom, sherin dossa. they were as equally as kind and made sure we were 100% satisfied with the process, product and they took the time to explain the the take-home care instructions. i can't say enough good things about this business and our experience. i feel like i want to stop by just to say hi if i was in the neighborhood (they are that welcoming and kind!) if you are contemplating trying out a wig, please go to reese's first. you won't need to go anywhere else. they have everything. you don't have to worry about anything at all. my mother is a different person now that she's wearing her wig. she has her confidence back and she looks beautiful. thank you to everyone at reese's for such a great experience and for the wonderfully supportive atmosphere. i will never forget how much you helped my mom. love, michelle"
5-star,1,"my experience at reese""s wigs couldn't have been any better! the experience was great, they took care of me and showed me amazing personalized care and hospitality. the staff helped me choose the perfect wig for me, they also made sure the adjustments were perfect, they also showed me to snap in the wig. my wig is truly amazing. it is better than i could have ever imagined. after chemotherapy my hair has been growing at slow pace which took away from my self esteem and image, but after reese's made this wig for me it's hard to hide the smile on my face. i love my wig thank you guys so much for doing such an amazing job and treating me like a queen."
5-star,1,"i was in town for the day and have been wanting to purchase a wig for some time. i stopped in reese's and was greeted by rochelle. even though i'm pretty sure she just started working there, she was wonderful. so warm and friendly and very helpful. i tried on about 3 or 4 wigs and ended up purchasing the first wig i tried on. it was a bit more than i had planned on spending but after ordering wigs online and having to return them because i didn't like the fit or the quality it was well worth it. i loved the personal attention and the service from rochelle. all in all it was a great experience."
5-star,1,"if you've ever thought of buying a wig you have to go here! sharin & equilla were awesome!!! when my sister & i walked in were immediately greeted with a friendly hello & were given the opportunity to look around without any high pressure. we had so much fun trying on different styles & didn't feel like we were annoying the staff. we had been to serge's wigs prior to coming to reese's & it was not a fun experience. besides the fact their prices were much both my sister & i brought two wigs. it takes awhile to find the right ones but with the professional help & many, many wigs later we were very happy with our choices. so...once again i must say go to reese's if you are in the market for a wig. they make it a fun experience!"
5-star,1,took my grandma here to get her a new wig for xmas....quality product and amazing service..the ladies were so nice and helpful
4-star,1,"diana is awesome! i went in for a ponytail to spruce up an outfit, but she found me a great wig for about the same price. and some great glow in the dark lashes. coming back again next trip for a new look. heck, i might come every trip!"
1-star,0,"i wouldn't suggest this business to someone who's had a decent experience with other places. when i came in, i was welcomed to the store. however, that's as far as it went with a positive experience. everywhere throughout the store i was followed by an aggressive employee who did not leave much distance, and i suspect followed me due to prejudice. that is a harsh thing to say, but i rarely ever get (obviously) followed by an employee in much smaller stores. i wasn't even dressed ""suspiciously"" and explained to her in advance i was interested in looking to gauge any potential future purchases due to a previous purchase not panning out well (due to my time range). when i asked her about a specific question about fiber types she deflected the question, saying ""well, we have many types of wig fibers here"". i expect more knowledgeable information coming from someone who's trying to sell me an expensive wig. i also expect more professional behavior to come from someone in such a shop. it made me feel very uncomfortable and turned me off from purchasing in the future. i couldn't personally complain about prices- storefronts are always more expensive than online purchases. that is a given. however, the wigs are a bit shiny for the price range, and did not have as much hair. i imagine they would work well for someone who does not want to go out of their way to find a wig or who wishes to get what they expect. but for those who are willing to take more of a chance, online wig purchasing from a reliable source is a better experience. cosworx is a local wig seller in las vegas, mainly for cosplay or lolita fashion. although they don't have a storefront, i would recommend their products ahead of this shop, or almost any shop for that matter."
5-star,1,"i have never wanted or needed a wig in my entire life.....until earlier this year. i have also never gone shopping for a wig, so i had no idea what to expect. i remembered seeing this place, driving down sahara one day. my mother and i decided to stop by and were immediately greeted by two employees when we walked in. we ended up spending over an hour at the store! lisa helped us the entire time. she was very friendly, patient, and made good suggestions. i definitely learned a lot about wigs! after trying on a bunch of them, i finally found the one that i liked and could live with. unfortunately, they did not have the color i wanted in stock, so they had to order it. no problem though, as i did not need it right away. it took about a week to come in. the only drawback was the prices. expect to spend at least $200 on a synthetic wig. human hair ones can be in the $700 + range. they also offer styling services, where they wash and re-shape your wig. i took advantage of this, and although it cost me $33, i know that if i tried to wash it myself, i would have screwed it up somehow. very convenient and it took about 3 days. when i picked it up, it looked brand new! i would definitely recommend reese's! wig shopping is not easy and it just takes time to find that right one. the employees here will help you with everything and i was happy with my purchase!"
4-star,1,prices are fair and the quality is way much more nicer than any gap i've ever seen. the women's perfume roots is one of my favorites but is getting hard to find in the states unfortunately. please dont ever discontinue the zip up sweatshirts! i practically live in those during fall.
1-star,0,had an item placed on hold on a friday evening. received a call that night at 9:30 pm while at dinner basically telling me they sold the item to another customer as ordered by the manager. will never do business with this company.
2-star,0,"45 $ for a crappy backpack is pricey in my humblest opinion...not that the gap is any better. yes, the staff is very friendly and courteous, the store is neatly organized and so forth but the clothes and bags are overpriced and for those who love the quebec style (not exactly similar to european, unless you have never been to europe) all they have to do is wear the same pair of jeans and the same jacket for 4 months without any washing...add a scarf, plastic over-sized sunglases and voilà...that`s the quebec, or so-called european look....so chic...."
1-star,0,"if you've ever wondered why canadians dress so badly, the answer is simple: roots. roots clothing is much like the way americans perceive canadians: boring and inoffensive. thankfully, here in quebec, people are more stylish and dress far better than their anglo canadian counterparts and you don't see many people in montreal (besides mcgill students) wearing roots clothing. in fact, roots may be reason enough to argue for quebec separation if only to keep out the ugly sweatpants and stultifyingly generic preppy wear."
5-star,1,"i think roots is much better than the gap - better quality (their stuff will last for ages), and a bit more sports focused in general. the prices aren't too bad, especially if you hit their sales or their outlet locations. i've always appreciated roots because they don't use outlandish colors, even when they're ""in season"" - which is good for me because i like to blend in. but they're not too bland - just nice lookin' stuff."
5-star,1,"this place is ""the best"". we walked in the last minute to attend my sons prom last night. sami stepped in and, let me say this""she is the best at what she does!"". her customer service is superb, a bubbly personality and we are going to make this happen attitude. the price of the tux was well worth it. thank you sami and rose."
5-star,1,"this is an excellent tuxedo shop that takes care of its customers, they really go out of their way to make sure you will have the best experience. i really appreciate their knowledge and their expertise and i highly recommend this place to anyone who is looking to get fitted for a tux."
5-star,1,"stopped in at rose tuxedo on a friday evening needing a tuxedo for saturday night. angelo met me at the door, was enthusiastic and ready to help. the customer service was top notch! angelo, laid out all the options, had me measured and out the door within 20 minutes. the next morning my tuxedo was ready for pickup at the indian school location. angelo offered to have it available for pick up at the 35th ave location, but it worked out better for me to pick it up at the indian school location. the tux fit perfectly, i was very pleased with the style and the fit. i'll be a repeat customer and would recommend rose tuxedo to anybody whether they need a tuxedo in a hurry or are planning for an event in advance."
3-star,0,we had some issues with our suits but after speaking with the manager he made it better and addressed the problems we had.
5-star,1,"rose tuxedo has some of the most designer tuxedos i could find in phoenix and the surrounding cities. i searched for months and months, and finally saw their web site online and i was sold. i had 10 groomsman, who all agree and love the tuxedo rental prices and the employees were awesome! try them i think you will be happy."
5-star,1,great place needed to rent some suits for my groomsmen and the lady was very helpful. this is a great place if you need to rent suits or tuxedos.
4-star,1,"i spoke with the owner, angelo, today. he said he did not hear of my son's bad experience back in may 2013 & he had not seen my yelp review until recently. he seemed sincerely apologetic for our bad experience at rose tuxedo and was willing to fix things. i think anyone that is willing to go out of his way to fix their mistake & make things right, like this owner is doing, definitely deserves to keep our business. thank you for your understanding & for making it right, angelo!"
5-star,1,we were very happy with the service we recently recieved at rose tuxedo. the staff was very friendly and treated us like kings. they had a great selection and their prices beat everyone else. we will definitely go back to rose tuxedo in the future and recommend it to our friends.
5-star,1,"i attended a recent wedding in phoenix and was one of the groomsman. i came in from out of town on the friday and stopped by rose tux to try on and pick up my tux. angelo, the owner, and his staff were great. they made sure everything fit properly and the prices were great. much better than what i was charged for one in houston."
1-star,0,"dear sams, i've been a long time costco customer but recently i decided to switch over to you because you are conveniently located. i've heard good things from friends who shop with your company which made me consider getting a membership in the first place. i wish i could say that i see what they were talking about but unfortunately my experiences have not been great. my problem is not so much the service but the products, specifically the food court. i've been to this location on 3 separate occasions and all 3 times i have recieved food of extremely burned quality. and i do mean poor quality. the food has been burned and it has been old. this has been the case with the chicken sandwich, hot dogs and the pizza. on the first 2 visits i didn't want to make a big deal, however after experiencing this for a third time straight...this can't be a coincidence and i can't be the only one with this issue. i can't imagine that every sam's club has the same issue so i would encourage you to review your food service standards and even inspect the equipment used to try to correct this issue."
2-star,0,they raised the price of gas like 15 cent raise same as a regular gas station at a store . we pay a member ship should be less . because of texas. i think that its gouging. just because it just happened 15 cent raise is bad .
5-star,1,"shopping for a large family can be expensive and often you don't get much to show for it! not the case here! you ... well i usually spend at least 100 bucks here each trip and can eat off most of the items for about 2 weeks or longer if canned goods or pastas! also, i must say they have a great bread selection i can get a pack of 12 pitas for about 4 bucks! you usually get 4 for 4 at smaller stores! the romaine lettuce comes in 6 packs those last about 2 weeks and cost just 4 bucks also! sams is full of great deals and i really encourage you to invest in a card if you have a large family, throw parties, or even have growing kids!"
1-star,0,"i came to pick up some water.... got charged for more... got sent to member services for the difference... 1 cashier to about 10 persons... been in line for 20 minutes... on the positive side, the time it took me to write this, i'm one person closer"
2-star,0,"welcome to your neighborhood bulk warehouse store, where you can buy almost anything from business supplies, to grocery items, clothing, and household equipment. not to mention a pharmacy, photo shop, and a auto service center as well. the layout of this sam's is/are all the same. they all carry the same merchandise, some more than others. the only drawback to this one compared to the others? the lack of available cashiers. it seems like each time i go here, there are only 3 or for cashiers working the registers, any time of day. the workers at the food court need a crash course in guest interaction. she was not very friendly, and gave a lot of people before me attitude. i'm sorry if you were having a bad day miss, but no one deserves that kind of customer service! overall, i would have to say that when you shop here, the service could be a hit or miss!"
4-star,1,"this sams is the one on craig rd. this is the one that's closest to where i live, and it's convenient for me to go to. this place is ok, but the one thing that i don't like is the fact that they don't have sushi like so many of the other sam's clubs do. it would be nice if they were to offer that option, because i'm pretty sure i'm not the only one that's not for sushi there before. i thought all sam's clubs we're consistent, i guess not. so whenever i can, i take a trip to the one on south rainbow, buy what i need and pick up some sushi while i'm there as they do offer that option. so just know that you will not be able to find sushi here if you want to pick some up while you're shopping at sam's club on craig road."
1-star,0,"i was shopping for families for the school i work at to help out for christmas. i had a huge cart of breakfast items to donate to our families and as i went to check out i got my total and began to pull out the cash that had been donated to our school. the cashier saw i had a large amount of $1's (which i know is annoying...i didn't even want to pay with it but it's what i had). the cashier proceeded to say, ""are you serious?"" i told her yes. she rolled her eyes and huffed and puffed through the whole transaction. at the end she raised both arms and loudly told the other customers in line ""this is not my fault"" and pointed at me. this was unprofessional and embarrassing for me. i called the manager at this location and am awaiting a phone call. hoping they make this right especially during the holiday season. i felt like i couldn't even help my families without being treated poorly because she didn't want to count out ones."
1-star,0,"if you call this store to check the availability of an item, they will keep you on hold for 20 mins or more until you decide to hang up because you have been waiting for so long."
1-star,0,"i come here almost every week it's clean and most of the time the employees are helpful. i just baffles me when you ask loud and clearly for something and they just balantly ignore you. i'll be willing to drive the extra miles to costco to receive better customer service. i've been in customer service since i was a teenager and believe in excellent customer service. you're a professional act like it. it's not like my request was much, all i wanted was a box. rude."
2-star,0,gasoline is consistently more expensive than at costco on decatur or the sam's club in centennial shopping center. this store is also never as clean as the other two stores and the lines are always long since the clerks have to completely empty your basket (yes even the heavy water packs) because i guess they don't trust their customers? prices for electronics are consistently cheaper at other stores as are most items where there is little savings realized by purchasing in bulk. know your price as this is a walmart owned operation and in many cases while the product is the same price as costco the value is less - even down to the width of the toilet paper.
4-star,1,"i buy bulk so i shop at sams club. lines can get long in the afternoon but shouldn't take too much of your time. i like that they gave boxes for customers to use, i know because it saves cost to use bags. large frozen section. some meats are marked down from original price which helps some people who are on a budget. especially some items are organic pretty cool for some people who like non gmo, pesticide free, vegan, and gluten free."
5-star,1,i come to this location for the super friendly and helpful pharmacy staff. i switched over from a regular drugstore that was hard to fill rx in a timely manner to a place that can have my rx ready in 20 mins or less!!! kim and mariana are the best!!
1-star,0,"ive been a customer since 07. cancelled my membership a few times due to the lack of customer service, but since costco is a little further from home i keep coming back... just recently my mother renewed the membership. so i go on to pick up my copy. first thing the guy is having a full conversation with some girl and just asked me ""how can i help"" in a very script way. second he proceeds to tell me that my mom would have to come with me to get my card. why if i'm just changing card?? then he is oh well anyways i cant even fund you in the system you need to purchase a new membership. very rude unprofessional service."
4-star,1,i'm a member of both sam's and costco. i get gas at this sam's every couple of weeks and visit the store once or twice a month. i've had very good expereinces with the staff the last several times shopping here. i also attended there pre black friday event where you could upgrade your phone for an inexpensive price.). i was very happy with how organized everything was with the process. they made appointments for everyone and also had a complimentry snack cart for the early birds who were waiting outside in the cold to get it. i also eat at the snack bar and the place is almost always a madhouse. the snack bar staff works incredibly hard to serve everyone. overall i feel the staff here does a pretty good job. i think the merchandise as a whole at costco is better but have no problem shopping here.
3-star,0,"we went to sam's club tonight and had an ok experience. understandably, it felt like we were shopping in a warehouse, but it would have been a little more enjoyable if the clerks at least acted like they cared. a smile and a friendly attitude costs nothing and goes a long way to winning over customers."
4-star,1,"great place for bulk grocery shopping since i live close by. they have a variety of shopping needs for your everyday life from frozen food, snacks, house items, clothes, movies, toys, vegetables, fruits, etc. i've had no problem getting in & out of this place. my only gripe is the long lines during the busy times. i wish they would open up more registers when the lines are long! other than that i would recommend this place for anyone thinking of signing up for a membership. i also enjoy their gas & carwash too."
2-star,0,"never really had an urge to go here. it was by coincidence that my aunt was in town for a birthday for one of my nephews. i just happen to not be doing anything on a saturday so i ended up driving her here. my aunt has a sam's club that is only about 10 minutes away from her house up in renton, wa. she also has a costco membership but that place was more like a half hour drive. im telling you guys right now why she got a sam's club membership is because of two things. convenience and the fact that sam's club carries a little bit more different products. originally i was gonna wait in the car for my aunt but i was curious so i tagged along. plus i wouldnt want her to push around what i would assume a really full cart around the store. as the cart was virtually starting to overflow i wondered if she was the only one handling this birthday party. from my observance, there are a lot of similarities to costco. the building size is virtually the same along with the set up of aisles classified by category. even the food court was similar. when it was all said and done, we ended up getting another cart because the first cart was spilling over already. total bill was about 370 dollars. in my opinion, the difference between these guys and costco is that sam's club has a bit more product choices but costco has better prices. even the sam's club gas was about the same as any gas station down the street. it was at 2.99 a gallon while costco was at 2.55. membership is about the same price. 100 bucks for the executive and about 50 bucks for the basic. in closing, i prefer costco. dont get me wrong, this place is ok with me. i dont care if they were right down the street from me, i would still do my normal shopping at costco when it comes to saving by buying in bulk. yelp 2015 review #65 563 overall"
5-star,1,i go there just to see larry the attendent the most friendly guy and good prices on gas. car wash is ok could be better
1-star,0,"i have been a costco member since 1998 and after my experience at this sam's club, it reminded me why i don't belong to sc. i came on a ""guest pass"" and didn't have a great experience. as i looked around i wasn't impressed by the selection of things offered compared to costco. the food court certainly could use some work. i did have a pleasant experience with one of the cashiers where you check out, but the girl working in the food court that helped me was another story. when i asked for my pizza to-go, she said that it wasn't her job to do that. i was a bit shocked and asked her if i was even able to get it to-go? she said yes, but that i'd have to go down to the end of the counter and wrap it with foil myself. i had no issue with doing this, i just had no idea about the foil or i wouldn't have asked to begin with. i decided to get a slice of pizza and a churro. the churro was .99 cents and tasted stale and hard, barely having any cinnamon or sugar taste to it. i didn't want a drink, so i just got 1 slice of cheese pizza priced at $1.98 and it came cut in 2 pieces. the pizza tasted terrible. i took 2 bites and then just threw it away. the pizza was sort of burnt on top and just didn't taste good. i had some return issues on items purchased when i came back a couple days later and with everything else i experienced, i can't see coming back period."
5-star,1,love this store always everything i need and so cheap when you have a family ain't nothing like sams club im always here love this place and my family loves it we can spend 3 hours in there then be like wow we been here 3 hours already lol
1-star,0,wow! the worst service ever all employees had an attitude and was quick to respond with a rude attitude i hate places like this!!!! ima just stick with costco !!! ugh!!!! i'm so mad!!!!!! even if they offer me somethin i wouldn't come back !!!
5-star,1,"we have memberships to both costco and sam's - mainly because we moved and there's sam's right next door. the sam's club experience is the opposite of everything we hate about trips to costco. no matter what time of week/day it is, it's never swarming with people who have seemingly never shopped in a public place, it's easy to find parking, the staff is friendly and they have some great gluten free options. :) now we visit nearly every weekend."
1-star,0,terrible customer service no manager available when it takes 25 minutes to make a pretzel and a previous visit they shut yogurt machine down 2 hours before closing
5-star,1,by far the friendliest sam's club i ever been to. i went first thing in the morning and the place was pretty much empty. i was in and out in 30 minutes. friendly employee helped me carry by 50lbs bag of rice. even suggested that i go online and place a order and arrange a pick up date. they will pull the items for me. how awesome is that! i love it!
2-star,0,"sam's club ia a bit like a bigger version of walmart made like a sort of costco. but costco set the bar way up there. and usually sam's club isn't too shabby but shit i went to this sams club because it was close. the first time i went it was to look around and the second time i just wanted a hot dog and my god what horrified me the most was their condiment area napkins cup covers and straw papers were everywhere it looks so dirty. it looked like it hadnt been cleanned for a week and the trash cans were overfilled. today i went and i couldnt find parking! not because it was full but because of inconsiderate assholes leaving carts and trash all over the parking lot i also saw an individual that was outside who wasnt doing his job he was taking a smoke break. correct me if i'm wrong but if the parking lot looked like shit people shouldnt have time to have smoke breaks, you should be making sure the place looks acceptable and not like garbage. and yeah its not his fault people suck but just like in resturants workers still have to clean up the place. and today the only condiment available was ketchup.. a hotdog is lonely without mustard and relish maybe onions. they should fix that. i dont want to eat a sad hotdog. the only reason ill still go to this sams is because the others are pretty far."
1-star,0,went in to replace a tire on my new car (already) i tell asian dude w blue triangle earrings my tire size & he's like what does it look like(wtf) he starts pointing at tires like does it look like this ? or this? or this? i'm like i'm sorry i don't look @ my tires much (looks like a fucking tire to me) so i'm like are you able to look @ it or i can bring in a picture??? his attitude is like i'm wasting his 420 time all huffy n puffy & frustrated- dude if you hate looking @ & pricing tires then why the f did you put on the uniform again & come in today? other dude w boston also in the same mode. does this dept hv a manager or did these too fools transfer from a work release program for lames to integrate into the workforce??? service here used to be quick friendly & dependable. i would never leave my sons life riding on these tires in the hands of these 2
4-star,1,well my wife and i go to sams alot for pet food and miscellaneous goodies we use alot ....the main thing to remember about sams is they sell in bulk.....but the samples and shopping experience is always a good one .....the downfall is you have to be a member which is about 50 bucks a month depending on what plan you get....but i really enjoy it for the bulk items
1-star,0,"grumpy, grumpy, grumpy cashiers! my husband tried to purchase a storage unit for inside the garage and was treated so rudely he wanted to apologize for disturbing them! who needs this kind of treatment in this day and age!"
3-star,0,"this is not a bad sams club. i love shopping there for stuff that are usually more expensive at normal grocery stores. the selection is ok, and the service could be better. we like to tank gas at their gas station, because their gas is usually 10 - 20 cents cheaper than other gas stations. we bought a grill from them in september which was discounted for 80 dollars. we were very happy with the deal and loved our grill until it stopped working after only 2 months. we took it back and they had the same grill but for $199. we talked to the manager but he said there is nothing he can do for us and we have to pay the extra money to get an exchange. i thought this was pretty disappointing. we ended up getting the money back and going home without a new grill."
4-star,1,this is one of the newer sam's clubs in town. it's not usually busy either. i barely ever see a lot of people here. service here is spotty. it's either pretty good or pretty bad. i guess it depends on who you get. selection is ok. not as good as costco but they also carry stuff that costco might not have.
5-star,1,very good shoes and given how long they last worth the price! i brought my mom here who lives in west virginia and she bought 3 pairs of shoes! the associates are friendly and professional. my mom is a retired school nurse and just loves sas shoes.
5-star,1,i walked into sas shoes and was pleasantly greeted by a female employee named encina who had a bubbly personality and a friendly smile. i believe she was the only person working at the time because another customer walked in and no one else came to help her but she was very quick to greet the other customer and let them know that she would be with them shortly. i was very impressed by her multitasking skills seeing as we both wanted to see multiple types of shoes in different sizes. she was quick and efficient with sizing and gathering the boxes for both of us. she took her time answering all of my questions and she patiently walked me around the store and explained the different types of shoes and handbags to me as well as showed me the catalog and the shoes that were not carried in the store for more options. i was unsure about what type of shoe i was looking for but she still made sure to take her time with me while going back and forth between me and another customer. i never once felt pressured into purchasing anything and she still gave me reassurance about my options and i still felt like she had my best interest at heart. i've been into this store before and have had bad service from a black man and a girl with short black hair and was unsure about going into this store again but encina has helped to change my mind. the store itself is very clean and has a ton of options for the most comfortable shoes. i didn't end up purchasing any shoes as i had a couple of other shoe stores to go to but i felt confident about wanting to return and recommending this store to others.
5-star,1,i recently purchased a pair of their men's business shoe. they feel great. i am able to wear them up to 12 hours a day. it reminds me of wearing a tennis shoe. the sales associate was knowledgeable and friendly. i will be going back to buy another pair in the future.
2-star,0,"very bad customer service today!!!!!!! the dark haired woman (becky?) was very rude & short to my mom. my mom had just checked out of the hospital & needed to get shoes for my dad who is in the hospital. they didn't listen and wouldn't even let my mom finish her sentences!! the store was empty with no other customers!!! we have bought at least 3 pairs of shoes for my dad at various sas locations. the rude lady told her she couldn't find my dad's size, and their database link from store to store. they didn't even offer to call the other store!!!!"
1-star,0,"i purchased some shoes for my mom a while back but they were too narrow. my mom never told me they did not fit and i threw away the receipt. i took my mom to exchange the shoes since they never did fit or were worn. after speaking to the store manager carol, she said due to the fact that they were worn and we did not have a receipt there was nothing she could do. mind you, sas shoes are expensive and i decided to speak over the phone to the regional manager lisa who accepted to return the shoes for an exchange. carol decided to tell me she was going to do a one time courtesy exchange even though we were abusing the return policy!!! it was not only unprofessional but rude of carol to make such a comment. it's very concerning to know there are employees as old as carol to act in such manner."
4-star,1,"course was in great shape except for hole 1 which was being aerated but you couldn't beat the price. no driving range, but a very large putting green. fairways are forgivable on some holes and target golf on others. not too many hazards which will keep your ball in play. love this course but it's a little far to go from my house."
1-star,0,"booked the round online with no mention of the course being plugged. received an email from the manager saying the greens were airified and if we want to cancel we could. i was fine with it being only the greens except when we teed off we found out it was the entire course. this is a complete waste of a round, holes, mud and sand all over the place. next time close the course or fully disclose to every one so no one wastes their money."
1-star,0,worst round of golf i have ever experienced. way overbooked. average of 2 foursomes waiting to tee off on every tee box. never go back.
5-star,1,"silverado is a great track for a nice, relaxing round of golf. however, i write this out of appreciation. i left a pair of expensive shades in a cart on thursday- they had them on saturday for me. appreciate the entire staff."
5-star,1,great course. for a public course it was in great shape. greens ran true and the fairways were immaculate. would play here again. pace of play on a busy sunday 4:15
4-star,1,"played here today for the first time. every single person we encountered was wonderful! two of our foursome were a bit late & they adjusted us no problem even though they were sold out until noon. the staff in the pro shop & bar were wonderful. the felt immediately comfortable there & had a great round of golf. the course has is great for amateurs, i only lost one ball."
5-star,1,"good fun course. back 9 is a if fun, and staff is really friendly and helpful! course is usually in pretty good condition as well"
3-star,0,decent value course but not scenic. fairways were okay. greens were decent. some patches were a little rough but not overly.
4-star,1,"fun layout for the casual golfer. great greens, fairways and rough in excellent condition, tee boxes well kept. their staff are quite friendly and helpful. pace could have been a bit faster...7:08 time played in 4.5 hours, but well marshaled. water every couple holes. not too many houses to hit. lots of gallery on the walking path throughout the course. i'll be back!"
5-star,1,"i'm still new to golf, but i've played this course 3 times. still experimenting around the valley but found silverado to be among the better kept courses. my only complaint is no driving range which means i have to go elsewhere to practice long balls. otherwise, the staff has always been friendly to me and the course is beautiful. went to practice putting for an hour or so and the gentleman at the bar gave me a free soda. plus, who doesn't like complimentary cool wet towels at the end of a round? no issue with speed of play, which you'd think is because i'm still new, but you'd be surprised. (western skies, i'm talking to you.) definitely will continue to be a frequent course for me. try it out."
4-star,1,this is a great course that can be very forgiving. the front 9 is wide open and the back 9 has more of a desert course feel. it can get backed up really quick so allow 5+ hours if you go late morning. while it can be a bit slow it is a great course overall.
4-star,1,overall not a bad little course i had a decent time but i was waiting at every tee box due to groups ahead of me. cart girls are very attentive. course is in great shape and prices are very reasonable. course is very forgiving for first time players to the course. would go here again if i have a chance.
5-star,1,"i like this course, lots of grass, i don't really care for the typical desert courses found all over the valley. i will warn you this is a very slow course. our tee time was 9:08 and we didn't even get started until like 9:30, we waited at almost every hole but only for like 5-7 minutes, not absurd but it does add up over 18 holes. it took about 5 1/2 hours to play 18 holes, a bit longer than i like. i only saw a marshall one time and he just drove by. there aren't a lot of hazards on this course which is nice if your are a novice or a crappy golfer like me. however there still are some long & tricky holes if you are a decent golfer."
4-star,1,"course is amazing condition for summer time in the phoenix area. greens are no joke, the absolute best i've played this summer. staff was friendly and got me out as a single ahead of a three-some. they have a nice putting and chipping area and there are three bays to hit some practice balls into. layout is not too challenging but there are a couple holes to test your ability. all in all a very nice track to play. i definitely will be back."
4-star,1,this course is on the less expensive end of the scale for scottsdale which still means fairly pricey (i believe it was around $80-$90 per person in prime season in end of march?). there is no driving range but we went to one of the courses nearby beforehand which wasn't very far away. overall though thought the course was pretty solid with a nice layout. greens in good shape. course had some challenges but also had an overall layout that seemed to keep the ball findable because everything sloped inward. got out at 8:45 or so and played pretty quickly. would definitely come back for more.
1-star,0,i played at this course for the first time this past saturday with some friends & felt the customer service was very poor. from one of the starters who didn't communicate with the pro shop to know that we were a foursome and wanted to be confrontational and act like we couldn't play together(until he found out he was in the wrong) to the beverage girls who seemed like we were bothering them every time they came around and we wanted to purchase drinks or food. just overall bad customer service and felt that we were an inconvenience to almost every employee that we came into contact with.
1-star,0,"the staff was completely disrespectful to us. they sent us out with a random player and then threatened to kick us off the course on hole 2, with no refund, if we didn't split up our group. the customer service was terrible but i'm biased considering the way they treated my group. the course is decent, wide open fairways but not very challenging. overall not worth the $50 i spent."
1-star,0,iv accompanied my husband to almost all the golf courses in phx and since past 1 year have nt been playing due to my fracture . i have never been charged for just riding in the cart b4 but this place charged us 18 bucks .. what a money making trick!!!
3-star,0,"nice, easy course but beware: you can reserve a threesome to find out that an old man will be your fourth, and he wants to date you. he proudly boasts that he only paid $20 when you and your peers paid $65/pp. yickes!"
5-star,1,great place to have lunch or a late breakfast. reasonable prices and good food. the patio is especially nice when the weather is cool. highly recommend!
5-star,1,"one of the most fun rounds of golf i've played in a long time. some challenging features, but plays pretty easy. fairways were immaculate! beautiful course, and they wiped down my clubs after my round (never had that happen anywhere else). most definitely worth the very reasonable green fee, and i'll play here again if i ever find myself in scottsdale again!"
1-star,0,"slow!!! this the slowest golf course in the world. i have played there 3 times, all within the last year. i was only able to finish once because of the extremely slow play and that time took 5 1/2 hours. the other time they started me on the back, which was fine because it is the nicer of the two 9's, it took 2 1/2 hours to play. i go to make the turn on to the front and they just let 7 groups of walkers out on the front, even though they new a bunch of people would be making the turn because they started everyone else earlier on the back. seeing this and then seeing the 5 groups waiting to tee of on 10, i went to the pro shop to kindly ask ""what's up?"", the guy with the creepy side burns and mustache basically told me i was screwed and said there was no chance of a rain check even though he admitted that it would take over 3 more hours to finish my round. for some stupid reason i went back again this past may. it took 2/12 hours to play the front and then it took 2 1/2 hours to play the first four holes on the back!!! when we got to the 14th tee there were, no kidding, 6 groups on the tee. not a marshall in sight! we decided to quit and drive to the clubhouse, as did two other groups. when we got back to the club house, the bag guys asked how we enjoyed our round... knowing that we did not come from the 18th. we told them very politely how slow it was and there only response was ""ya, slow golf sucks"". please find new management because this is a decent course, when you get to play the whole thing!"
4-star,1,"i am sorry to see so many bad things said about silverado. its one of my favorites. i golf mostly in the afternoons. we play at this course about 3 times a month. never had a problem. my foursome even got to take off early. one time my dad (age 85) was late getting to the golf course. when he arrived the staff loaded his clubs and him, up and brought him out to our hole where we were getting ready to tee off. the course itself is pretty forgiving. pretty open in the front 9, little tighter on the back. i recommend the friday night fish fry as well. they have a great dinner and golf special."
1-star,0,"11:30 tee time, finally hit the first tee at 12:15. followed with almost a six hour round of golf. not a marshal in site to speed up play. our group waited almost half an hour just to tee off on a par three. i've been to this course quite a few times over the past couple of years. it is a nice layout and usually in good shape, however after today, never again. having a good round of golf is all about establishing a rhythm. you will never establish that here."
5-star,1,"silverado sure doesn't feel like a muni. it's a great, fairly easy course that is a lot of fun and not too penalizing. the front 9 has a more traditional layout, while the back 9 plays a little bit like a desert course. by that i mean that you might have to tee off over some scrub, and off the fairway is semi-scrubular. the tee boxes are spread out from hole-to-hole, which is nice because it separates the groups in front of and behind you. i also love starting the round with a shorter par 5, because you can duff a shot right off the bat and still get away with par."
1-star,0,"booked my tee time here on line with golfnow. i have two junior golfers but golfnow does not offer that option. however at check in every other course i booked this way has given me the junior rate when lower. not silverado and it was a $30 per player difference. there was no good reason not to give me the lower rate, so i felt they were basically saying ""screw you"". the guy in the pro shop said ""i could have sold it to someone else at the higher rate"" what??? if i called you would have given me the lower rate, so what is the difference? it cost me more to book online? that makes sense...not. as for the course, nothing special and a rather strange layout with long drives at times between tee boxes. very slow pace of play too. greens were ok though so i will give them one positive.. after this experience there is no way i will come back here."
4-star,1,"i'm not sure why this course gets such a low rating. this is a fine golf course. it is in excellent condition. the front nine is somewhat boring as it is basically straight out and straight back. the back nine offers a little more challenge and a few more interesting holes. a warning to walkers: the front nine is easily walked, but the back nine is tough as there are very long stretches from green to tee. i played it on 11-24-11 in the first group of the day. the greens were pretty slow, but that was probably because there was a heavy dew that morning and the greens were still pretty wet. as they dry out during the day, they probably run a little faster, but will still be just moderate speed greens. it's a straightforward course, with no tricks off the tee. the 10th hole is a sharp dogleg right with a blind tee shot. other than that, you can see the shot you need to hit from every tee box. the finishing hole is a moderate, downhill par 3 over water. beautiful golf hole."
1-star,0,"they sell your e-mail address to spammers! if you reserve your tee time with them online, they will sell your e-mail address to viagra and penis enhancement spammers. it happened to me. i used a unique e-mail address with them and next thing i know, i start getting spam on that e-mail address. i confronted them about it and they denied it and didn't take any action which makes them worse. the golf facilities are mediocre so don't even bother."
3-star,0,"i don't golf at all but like to ride my bike along the multi-use path from mcdonald drive to pima. i watch out for the golfers and occasionally have to duck or at least honker down when i hear ""fore"". to me the golf course doesn't look too exciting but then again i don't golf. if i were to golf i would never get past the first hole and take too much time. others seem to enjoy it and yell when the ball gets close or into the hole. for me riding my bike is far more enjoyable and very scenic with great views of four peaks and sunsets behind camelback. over the past several years i have collected hundreds of stray golf balls. i save the uniquely marked ones from other golf courses including silverado but otherwise box the others up. i have offered them to my nephews to sell but there was little interest. i finally found someone who wants them for distribution to a youth organization. now i can go out and collect more... plus get more exercise which is my primary objective in the first place."
4-star,1,"i'm not much of a golfer. there. that's how i chose to start this review. so take this for what its' worth ... i've played maybe a dozen times, usually public courses in miami/orlando/atlanta. i was in scottsdale for business and had a day off so i took advantage of this by making a tee time online for 3:15pm on a friday the night before. 18 holes and cart included was $30. free tees, and another $25 for rental clubs and i was on my way. i got to play by myself (bonus, because i hate slowing people down ... i mean, i shot 110) and enjoyed this 18 more than any other (except for a course i once played in orlando with my father, for sentimental reasons). the course was very well kept, much better than any i've played on in miami or southern la. first time playing in arizona was beautiful and amazing to appreciate the contrast between the red clay and green, green fairways. not much water, but just enough for me to lose 3 balls in it (i lost 9 total, again, i'm not that good). freeways line the start of the back 9. a little distracting. i think i hit 3 balls into ongoing traffic. regardless, it only got better from there. gorgeous 13th and 15th and 16th holes, among the others. beautiful semi-island par-3 on 18. i played until dark, nailed a 20ft put, almost birdied 3 in a row, and had an awesome time - very memorable - and happy as hell i took the initiative to play 18 on my day off even though its not my sport. i would recommend it. this course was beautiful."
4-star,1,"always a great selection, staff is always very helpful. i only buy one brand of scubs - greys anatomy signature, they seem to always have it in stock. though the prices are a bit higher."
1-star,0,"got a set of scrubs for mothers day as a gift from a friend who didnt give me the receipt. the scrubs didnt fit so i brought them back to scrubs and beyond where he said he purchased them from. the store manager kim, was rude and not helpful. stated that because they just had a sale, and he didnt purchase them under a loyalty card member number and i didnt have a receipt, she wouldn't take the scrubs back for a store credit, although they carry the same brands of scrubs! i'll never buy scrubs from here again. a store manager with horrible customer service!!!!!! i'll stick to scrubtastic from now on!!!!!!!!!!"
2-star,0,"i've been here a few times to get scrubs, usually without a problem. but today, i walked in and was not welcomed whatsoever. there was only one other customer. whatever, maybe they didn't see me. i browse and pick up 5 items and walk to the dressing room. at this point, i'm the only customer there. i look around and no one offers to unlock a room for me. fortunately i checked and one room was already unlocked so i helped myself and tried on the items. as i walk out, again the two workers behind the desk don't even look up or acknowledge me. not ""how did those work out for you? do you need any help?"" at this point i've been there for 25 minutes and no one has spoken to me! i put the scrubs that i would have purchased back on the racks. i'm not giving a store with zero customer service my business! besides, i found them cheaper on amazon. it's not hard to say hello. never going back."
5-star,1,"excellent service! i'm from out of town and i needed a pair of scrubs asap! these ladies not only helped me to get here, but when i did they assisted me get the best pair of scrubs on the market! thank you kim!!"
5-star,1,"i came here last week to buy scrubs for work. the last time i shopped here was about 4 years ago when i was in high school. anyways, i love the fact that it's on eastern in a nice plaza that's close to where i live. when i walked in, i was greeted by one of the workers who i think might be training still, but she was very friendly! a little shy, but i know how that feels just starting off. i think she's a great addition to the team there. i was just walking around first because i like to browse first- i knew what color scrubs i needed. i was greeted by a second worker who was wonderful as well. i told her the colors i needed & she showed me the colors in all of the different style pants and tops. i tried almost all of them on and was able to choose the ones i liked. for 2 tops and a pair of bottoms, it was a little over $100 after tax, which i'm okay with. the scrubs are comfortable and fit extremely well. i've bought scrubs before because they were cheaper in price, but quality and fit might not be as nice. just remember: you get what you pay for!"
2-star,0,"i came into this store due to my school's required dress code for the bsn program. when i brought my paperwork for the order form for the school uniform scrubs, the woman working there with long, dark hair pulled into a ponytail seemed to have quite the attitude. she proceeded to grab pairs of scrubs, lab coat and polo for me to try on and tossed them into the fitting room. when i tried those on, i didn't like the fit of those pants she first brought in. so my aunt grabbed a pair that was next to the ones the woman originally had me try on. when those didn't fit, i asked her for a different style and she replied in a very impolite and condescending tone, ""those shouldn't have been grabbed in the first place."" then she let out a loud breath and walked off. she was rude all the way through the check out. i'll be glad once i get my scrubs and not have to return here. oh and orders take forever to come in."
1-star,0,i come here regularly and always buy expensive scrubs. i haven't had a problem until i brought back unworn greys anatomy scrub and a women who i presume to be the manager told me she couldn't refund my money because they were worn.. it isn't my problem that when i bought these that they looked worn. they had been sitting in my closet for less than a month.. i did not appreciate being accused of something that i did not do. definitely going to be taking my business elsewhere.
4-star,1,"4 stars because of all the other scrub stores i've been to, mainly in california, the scrubs here are pretty expensive. bought 6 pairs, spent around $380. i know, why did i spend so much? i strongly felt like i needed new scrubs and they had a good selection of grey anatomy scrubs. my favorite! anyway. i was on my way to target and i saw this store, so i had to stop by! the place was much smaller than i pictured it would be. lots to choose from but pretty crowded in that sense. customer service was pretty good. one lady greeted me and asked if i needed her assistance. the other one who rang me up was also kind and answered my questions. there were two dressing rooms, decent size but i wish there were at least four because there were a few others who wanted to use the fitting room. if i do go back, i'll have to check out the shoe section. i didn't have the time. i'll update this review if i do go back."
3-star,0,"you should train your managers to have better customer service. not even an apology when you failed to do your job. you had my scrub shirt for several months and still didn't have it embroidered! just said ""if you want i can send it for embroidery."" what the heck of course you should send it cause i paid for it. i wish i recorded it cause you really didn't apologize. not even an apologetic look. your customer service is terrible. update: manager called back to apologize and will be shipping me my scrub shirt once it gets back from embroidery. so, i'll change my review from 1 star to 3 star. it was still really a bad experience looking back. i wish people you put charge of facing customers are ones that genuinely want to serve your customers."
4-star,1,i came in to speak to a manager about the issue i had with receiving a ladie's polo instead of a man's and she took care of the issue. thanks.
5-star,1,"i have been here twice in 2 days! i arrived not wanting to spend 2k on scrubs for my new veterinary clinic! being the nice person i am i offered to buy 1 set of scrubs and undershirts for my practice employees! i went in apprehensive because i have been looking online for so long! but this older sweet lady came out of no where and did nothing but help me! she snuck up like a ninja and never left my side u til ""we"" made the right selections for my practice! her name was tina and she is the manager. she was so helpful. honestly i left with a catalog and tons of ideas! today when i came back she was their to help me. her staff was amazing and i was in and out in no time! i'm happy with my selection. the knowledge of the scrubs they sell helped tremendously! i feel confident in my purchase!! thanks guys!! i set up a business account and will be back!!!"
3-star,0,"i really like the employees here. however, every time i go into the store they never have anything that i am interested in in my size. i end up having to order online. it's a hassle to say the least. good customer service though."
4-star,1,"nice selection of scrubs, not a huge store but you can probably find what you need in a pinch. the door alarm/chime is deafening though, and right above your head as you walk in. you can hear it from clear across the parking lot so you have to be ok with bleeding from the ears if you want to shop here."
5-star,1,i really like this store. everytime i go the ladies are always helpful. the store is well stocked with a lot of choices and sizes.
1-star,0,"my experience here was a nightmare!!! so i started a new job and i am now required to wear scrubs. i came here and has the worst retail experience of my life!!!! michelle was so rude to me! first, asked her for recommendations on scrubs and she told me that she's doesn't know and she only works there and and she can't make choices for me... uhm hello?!? how can you work there and not know anything about what you're selling? second, i ended up with 4 pairs of scrubs and bill came up to more than $150, she didn't even offer me the coupon! the girl that was standing next to her told her to give the coupon of $20 off (purchases over $100... i think) to me and she claims that she ""forgot"" about it. so me being already aggravated and just wanted to get out of there did not even check the receipt. got home and checked the receipt and saw that she charged me an extra pair of pants!!!!! i called her and told her that she charged me an extra pair of pants and she her answer was ""if you want your money back, you have to come back to the store"". wow just wow! what a nightmare!!!! i hope her management sees this. she deserves a disciplinary action!"
1-star,0,"because of my employer i have to buy my scrubs here. i don't know if my scrub orders take forever because my company is paying for the scrubs or if they just have really shitty slow service. even if you pay with a gift card your looking at a month to two months wait time to get your stuff. it's even more annoying when you finally get the call that your scrubs are in but when you go to pick it up, the jacket you ordered still hasn't arrived! wth!?! why call me when the order isn't completed!! at least let me know so i can decided if i want to make the trip. this place is such an inconvenience"
3-star,0,"pretty small medical supply place, but they carry a pretty good selection of scrubs! even though i am only allowed to wear black and white scrubs, i saw lots of different designs and plenty of different colors to choose from. what i really like to is that they have pants for the shorter people, like myself. prices range from $20 - $40 on the scrubs tops or pants, i'd say that's pretty pricey."
1-star,0,"new manager ashley is unprofessional and rude! after they messed up on an order i went in to check status of the order and she was very rude advising me that they send items for embroidery on tuesdays (no one mentioned that before and as a customer, how am i supposed to know that) i told her i did not appreciate the attitude, she said she had attitude because i had one first (waving her finger as she spoke) although i'm not the one getting paid to provide good customer i explained that i simply asked a question, and that the first time we placed our order it took 4 months to get the order right (there was a change in management @ that time as well) this is our 2nd large order. she continued to repeat that ""well we send orders out on tuesdays"" i informed her that i am also in customer service and regardless of the tone or attitude i am given i don't let that affect the way i respond. i advise her i would call corporate, her response ""good so will i"" with a smirk. we are paying customers that will take our large office orders elsewhere next time. location won't matter, customer service will!"
2-star,0,"this store is in a good location, in the target shopping center. they have a variety of scrubs but they are lacking in the popular brands of scrubs. most of mine had to be ordered. the staff seemed courteous in the beginning but after a while they seemed annoyed with my questions. the girl placing my order on the computer moved slow and stopped to huff and puff every so often making it take even longer. next time i will order online thru a different store and save myself the frustration."
4-star,1,"i hate shopping for scrubs. they are my least favorite thing to shop for. i'd much rather be spending my money on purses or nice shoes or regular clothing. but alas, i wouldn't be able to afford any of those things if i didn't buy scrubs for work and bring home the bacon. so since we've established that i don't have a choice in the matter, if i have to buy scrubs this isn't a bad place to go for them. the service is excellent for a scrub shop. the store is very well organized and there's a nice selection of brands. sometimes finding your size in a certain color is difficult but in most cases they can order what you're looking for and you can pick it up in store later on. make sure you tell them which hospital you work in because, chances are, you'll get some sort of a discount. this is the place my department uses for our scrub credits (we get a $50 credit here to buy our assigned colors. anyone that knows scrubs knows that doesn't go very far. so the extra 10% off helps.) i think i'll be back here more often, especially since i'm pretty sure life uniform in whitney ranch is closed..."
5-star,1,"i went to the scrub store to gets scrubs for my tanning business ... i had the sweetest sales person, vera. she was very helpful with my purchase. i wanted to get them monogrammed because i was going on tv and wanted the advertisement on my back while facing away from the camera. i did not have a great deal of time to prepare for this so this was july 3rd, the day before a holiday ! abby the manager i believe was so gracious to take my scrubs to the embroider place and wait to have them done the same day and called me and i had them by 8 pm the same day !! these girls knew that i was in a tight jam and went out of their way to help me out and make sure that i was taken care of !! i would highly recommend them to anyone looking for a uniform, you dont have to be a nurse to rock scrubs baby !!!"
3-star,0,"every time i've been here, the staff has been extremely helpful and always willing to help me with sizing and explaining different brands & materials. they have a pretty sizable selection; however, i find they are always limited on sizes. i'm a petite s or m, and i have a difficult time finding my size in the scrubs i like. usually, the sizes they have on the racks are the only sizes available. the staff is always willing to order the correct size for me, but i'm an instant gratification kind of gal. also, they are a bit pricey. i've found the exact same scrubs online for more competitive pricing, but like i said, i don't like waiting so i'd just rather pay a bit more for the item right away then wait for online shopping. :p i also like that they offer a discount depending on the hospital you work for or if you're a student. that's definitely helpful! the real reason i keep coming back to scrubs & beyond is the staff. i've always had exceptional customer service here, and that's enough for my patronage."
4-star,1,"friendly staff, eager to help you. this was my first experience trying on scrubs so i needed to figure out what looked best on me. i was helped while in the dressing room by them bringing me additional sizes. i had a good experience here and the selection was nice as well!"
1-star,0,"the only reason why i went here was because i got a 30% coupon at school during the nursing appreciation week. i usually go to the scrub store near russell road. this is was my second horrible visit. this blonde girl(chubby or preggers) that works there has a very bad attitude. i was hesitant to walk in but it was the last day to make the purchase using the coupon. let me just tell you that she wasn't very accomodating. why bother working if you're going to drive customers away? if retail isn't your forte, don't work because it makes people like me mad at your kind. i would have bought at least $200 worth of shoes and scrubs but instead, her little attitude made me not want to spend money there. sorry, that's just the way it is.."

1-star,0,"this has got to be the all time worst sears when it comes to customer service. we were in the other day trying to exchange some items. we had the receipt and everything still had the tags on it. we were told by the clerk we could not exchange the items because they were purchased over 30 days ago. we then spoke with the store manager & general manager who both responded that we were just out of luck and walked away. we have called the customer service line and sent emails. to each one the response has been ""that's our policy so you are just out of luck."" so we are closing our sears account and will not be shopping there any more! now to figure out what to do with the items we needed to exchange!"
4-star,1,sears has all the home appliances you could need and they have cute business attire. my mom needed a black blazer and we found one in there . very helpful
1-star,0,"refrigerator delivery & haul away of existing unit, terrible beyond belief. not one good thing. call center made numerous promises to send a 4 man team - twice only sent 2 men. the subcontractor delivery service, inovelle, rude & lazy. sad & disappointing would not recommend them or any company that subcontracts delivery of appliances."
1-star,0,"holy hell this store is pathetic. today i spent an hour shopping here. lots of stuff on sale and prices i was willing to pay. while trying to confirm sale prices and clearance prices you figure out quickly none of their price scanners work. so you know what? i might buy more if some things are cheaper than they're marked .. but since i can't tell, i don't pick up other items. then i go get in line to pay. i wait right next to the ""line forms here"" sign. i got to stand there and watch a cashier argue with a customer over something (i have no opinion of who was right as i didn't really listen). she calls over her manager who also starts to argue. he actually said to the customer ""well i guess i'll wait till you stop talking so i can get a word in edgewise."" and a few other rude comments. i swear to you if you ever say that to me while i'm trying to ask you something i will throw all the merchandise literally right in your face. the other cashier was taking forever to ring the customers before me up. finally another woman comes over (a large woman wearing only a tank top - i don't need to see that much of your employees skin). she tells the cashier she can't use that register because ""it doesn't know what day it is"". so they cancel the transaction and move to another register wasting more of my time. at this point the arguers leave. the cashier turns around and looks at me in line, then turns back and starts putting unwanted merchandise on carts to go back to the floor. i wait again. while she's doing this another woman walked up to her register and she immediately began ringing her up knowing full well i was standing in line. at this point i threw my 4 items on a table and walked out. if you're wondering why your stores are doing so poorly and you're all going to be unemployed soon, this is exactly the reason. dirty stores. merchandise all over the damn place. useless employees. and marginal quality inventory. you will deserve what you get. ~~~~~~~~~ edited to add: you notice that not a single negative review has a reply from their management? or their regional management? because they don't care at all about their customers. also, if you try to send in a complaint on their ""feedback"" section of their website it has a question which requires an answer - except the page doesn't give you a box to input an answer - and guess what? you can't submit your feedback unless that question is answered. well played sears, well played. you can't fix what you claim to not know about, right? too bad you're playing yourselves into bankruptcy and unemployment."
5-star,1,"i love coming here and getting amazing deals (here as in sears in general, not this specific location). the sears back home doesn't have the certain shirts i liked, no matter the location. i had time to kill before my flight back home, and decided the hit up the mall which this sears was attached to. i took a look and they had the flannels i was looking for and at half price (44$ to 22$). i bought a few of them and went to the counter, the price was even lower (they ended up being 17.65$) each instead which was fantastic! and the icing on the top? they didn't ask me stupid questions like what's my phone number and other dumb ass questions like that. overall, a beautiful experience and great location. would highly recommend. and to those saying the mall itself is ghetto, i really don't think so. but that will get addressed in my review of the mall itself."
5-star,1,"a solid store for shopping either in store or online! i like the fact that they will price match their online prices, unlike their sister store kmart. that makes things so convenient if you're like me and consistently scanning items with your phone like you work there just to make sure your getting the best deal! if you shop here you absolutely need to sign up to be a shop your way rewards member! it is their free rewards program! you get coupons almost daily that makes shopping here almost a chore, because you never want to miss out on a deal! for you latecomers there's a new perk. the picture people photo store is now located in sears, this means you can now accumulate points from your photo visits!"
1-star,0,"we will never buy another appliance from sears! their appliance service department is the world's worst! the techs are not trained to service a lg front loader washer, numerous, numerous trips and finally sears replaced the washer. yesterday i had a preventive maintenance appointment on the replacement and they cancelled the appointment."
1-star,0,"do not lose your receipt, if you do you will be screwed. they will tell you to swipe the card you used for the transaction and ""see if it reads it"" well it didn't. less then one week after purchase. and that's it, no store credit available for a brand new set of pots with the sears sticker that they put on for bigger items to get out the store still on it. i used to love sears but will never go to another one again until they change their return policy back to the way it used to be. can see why they will be out of business soon. on a side note i returned a 2 yr old dyson vacuum to costco the next day with no receipt, got a brand new one... it was pretty awesome, reaffirmed my feeling for how sears values their customers...."
1-star,0,"this location behaves like a stereotypical car repair place. they would not repair my car without doing a $90 diagnostic, even though i know what's wrong with my car. how do i know? sears technicians told me what was wrong four months ago when they ran the diagnostic, which i paid for at that time! my sears location in california is great, but i immediately felt like i was dealing with hustlers at this location."
1-star,0,"beware! if you order from sears, they have a hard and fast 30 day return policy. you need to change, sears. i anyone needs a 30"" microwave trim kit...i have one they won't take back after 34 days"
1-star,0,every single time i come in to the jewelry department there is only one worker and there is always a line. all i came to do today was pick up earrings that had to be repaired. as usual there was one worker and she was already helping another customer. the customer was indecisive about what watch she wanted to purchase so i knew it was going to be a long wait and then when she finally decided on a watch the checkout process is taking forever. she is still trying to check out the other customer as i am typing this and it's been no joke twenty minutes already. it's not their fault that customers are indecisive or want to split the payment on different cards which apparently makes the transaction complicated but it is their fault that they always only have one person working the jewelry department. all i need is to pick up my earrings!!!! that will take what a whole 2 minutes?? omg and she's still not done checking her out! who takes over 20 minutes to process a watch purchase??? ugh hate this about them!!!
1-star,0,"the return policy of 30 days is incredibly stupid. i bought my son some clothes for his birthday, you know i was thinking ahead. when to return them 32 days later and the rude ""manager"" was snotty and said that the ""policy"" is 30 days and that they couldn't return them. i will never shop at sears or kmart again due to this policy. when i mentioned to the cashier about buying gifts for christmas, i was told that they change the policy in december to 45 days. they make concessions for the holiday season, but not for the entire year. i then went to penney's and their return policy is 45 days. so long to sears and their affiliates. i am tired of the customers being treated like second hand citizens. i can't wait until they go out of business due to cruddy customer service."
1-star,0,"worst experience ever...bought a $1500.00 tv that went bad after 35 days, but because it pass the 30 days policy she will not exchange it....will not buy from that store ever...the manager natasha will not help in any way, after i've seen transactions override many times... they are more worried about their sales than the customers ...."
1-star,0,"don't shop at any sears, even online, if you're buying appliances or anything that might need installation or service. in a few short years, the ceo and board have turned a corporation that was a flagship of american retailing into a company that cannot be trusted. their internal corporate communication is so poor that i got five different answers in one day as to whether an item that had been scheduled for installation would installed and at what period of day. it was not installed as requested because the company to which installation was outsourced (sears used to do all their own installations) never received any kind of work order and wasn't capabable of installing the equipment as needed. the company refused to honor their product or installation guarantee or even to remove equipment that their poor installation had rendered unusable. after paying over $700 total for an $400 piece of equipment because i wanted it installed correctly, i had to pay $200 to have it hauled away. it was not used once. the ceo and board should go to hell for what they've done to this once excellent corporation for the sake of short-term products. i refuse to buy anything there, even a bottle of water, because of the poor treatment and false satisfaction guarantees. i've heard similar comments from other consumers. go to hell, sears."
4-star,1,"i have been coming to this sears location for years and really have very few complaints. i usually know what i am looking for when i stop by or it's to pick up an online order. when i have an order to pick up, i just go to the designated area and if you know where the doors for the mall food court entrance are...head to that part of the parking lot and you will see doors with a sign for sears saying customer merchandise pick up and they even have designated parking for those customers. once inside i simply enter my info and then within minutes someone brings out my order. i do this often when i see a good deal online and don't want to deal with looking for it in the store and then waiting in line to buy it. you can also earn points with every purchase as part of their rewards program if you order online or purchase in the store to redeem for stuff. i recently came by on black friday and when i saw how many people there was inside shopping and how long (i mean loooongggg) the lines were, i wondered how bad the experience was going to be. well, it wasn't bad! i looked through the area with the small kitchen appliances and other home goods and wasn't impressed at all. the area where the tools are was however spacious and they had plenty of employees on hand to assist. i was able to find amazing deals on some christmas gifts for my hubby and even though the line looked horrendous it went pretty quick and they had every register (smart on black friday) open. i wish some of the other departments were bigger like other sears locations, but the mowers and tools i have purchased here have been of quality and most of the craftsman stuff has a warranty and i haven't had issues with getting certain things replaced. they don't refill chalk boxes (lines) free anymore and most measuring tape has restrictions, so keep that in mind for those of you that were used to getting those filled/replaced for free in the past."
4-star,1,"i like this sears better than the boulevard mall location, maybe because it's newer, the automotive department is close by, and the children's department (which is facing the entrance doors, so you can see outside of the store) doesn't feel like you're deep in a dungeon (the blvd. mall's sears' lower level is in the basement). upper level has children's, home/linens, while the lower level has womens, juniors, swimwear, jewelry, and shoes. the cashier desk is at the children's department. i like the children's department (this location doesn't have as much baby care equipment as the blvd. mall store, unless i missed it, and it's in another section) because we usually find something for our little guy here: lots of disney and other cartoon-character themed clothing, as well as carters, and affordable mix & match tops & bottoms, toughskins clothing available in all sizes for toddlers and young children (sears brand). the elevator is near the home/linens on the upper level, while on the lower level, it is near the shoe department. yesterday was a friends & family event with an additional 20% off prices (coinciding with the ""back to school"" rush in the mall, which was jam-packed), not including clearance items. we had been here the week before (there were quite a few markdowns in the children's department), and went back to the shoe department to see if our son's size was available (we recently went over his wardrobe and shoes, and learned that his feet grew out of many of his shoes!); luckily, we found a pair of joe boxer slip-on canvas shoes. lots of benches to try on shoes, but someone left five pairs there, so i scooted them over to one side. i noticed that the swimwear was marked down to $9.99. a very long line at the main cashier on the lower level, so my husband checked with the jewelry department to see if he could pay for the shoes there; luckily, they said yes. there were more customers here during the ""back to school"" rush, but it wasn't crowded. besides the children's shoes stacking up on one bench, the store was pretty much orderly."
1-star,0,"do not buy any kenmore kitchen appliances from this place i have not had my range or microwave even 90 days and had the repair people come out 3 times already i am too done and each time they keep saying it just needs adjusting and the sad part is on the consumer affairs report everyone that has purchased kenmore ranges and microwaves have the same complaint....either it burns up your food or undercook your food and does not bake evenly, as for the microwaves what normally would take 2 minutes takes up to 6 minutes to heat up.....their salesmen will lie to you about how good the kenmore product is ....don't listen there is well over 300 plus complaints."
2-star,0,"placed an order online that required in-store pick up. arrived the next day at merchandise pick up and entered order info in kiosk computer. nothing. we are informed that the item is a floor model and hasn't been pulled yet. we walk back to electronics and find it. the salesperson unplugs it and we are thinking we are done. that would make way too much sense. since we ordered and paid online for this exact unit, we must wait until it is ready for delivery. wtf? it is sitting right here. if we want to take it before the sears computer in the sky deems that it is ready (maybe later in the afternoon), then we will need to pay for it again, and this time no warranty. again, wtf? we are informed that sears and sears online are different entities. your issue, not ours. here we were holding the item, with an online receipt, ready to leave, but it was not good enough. manager intervention, frustrating explanations of the obvious, time wasted on something very simple. does it have to be so hard? sears is dying for a reason. customer service in america is dead."
2-star,0,"this store is closer to where i live, so it's convenient to come here . but whether i'm on the phone with them, or in the store the staff is not friendly at all, and if i want to be transferred to a certain department to ask them a simple question about printers, i'm transferred like 8 times - seriously . so i will go out of my way to another sears for better customer service skills ."
1-star,0,"stay away from the sears meadows mall watch repair shop!!! complete ripoff!!! took watch in to get a new battery and after they did the work they charges me $19.00 for a .50 battery. the workers there are jerks, nasty and unprofessional. stay away!!!"
1-star,0,"do not buy any appliance from sears, they sold us a damaged water heater! ! it's been 3 days without hot water, we were going to install the new one last night when we opened the box it came in and realized it was dented. they didn't even pack it in foam or anything, the box pretty much feel apart when we tried closing it again so we can take it back. this is unprofessional and ghetto and so are the sears workers !!! also if you do buy anything here, check your shit before they load it into the vehicle or truck and find out how long the return period is because i'm sure as ive read online, it probably won't work properly either. how fucking ridiculous this place is selling damaged new appliances and then telling us that we have to wait till they order a new one or drive across town for another one! this should have never happened in the first place !! and don't even get me started on the return process where they run us around from one department to the next because they fucked up! !"
5-star,1,"placed an order on line. very easy process. went to the store, walked up to a checkout counter and asked the girl where merchandise pick-up was located. lucky us, it was right around the corner! went to pick-up area, entered my info into machine, and someone brought my merchandise out within 3 minutes! it couldn't have been easier!"
4-star,1,"i needed to get some new appliances and went to this store. sears has excellent service on appliances so i was motivated to buy. joe, the salesman, greeted me immediately and provided a no pressure presentation of the options available. of course he pitched the kenmore products but explained the features on the variety of manufacturers, their warranties and discounts and gave a comparative analysis. i have shopped at this sears store for many years and find that it has great retail service and on hand merchandise."
1-star,0,do not order to pick up merchandise here. they are very unorganized and slow at this location. you're better off driving 30 minutes out to a different location.
1-star,0,"i bought a dishwasher at the sears online store and changed my mind after i paid for it with paypal. they told me that the sale was still pending and i needed to wait another 24 hours before i could cancel it. i called back the next day and canceled. this has been over a week and i still haven't gotten my money back. sears has held onto close to 400.00 of mine and it appears that i'm going to have to fight to get it back. i submitted a dispute with paypal, (which will take 10 days for me to get my money) and also have spoken to countless people regarding my refund. most of the phone numbers don't answer and personally, i will never do business with sears again. i really couldn't afford to have this mix up with 400.00 for a couple of weeks. sears is supposed to be a reputable company, but apparently they are doing so poorly, they hope you don't notice that they haven' given you a refund."
1-star,0,i came here on black friday to get some of the items listed on their cover ad for the big sale. when i got there is was complete chaos. they did not have any of the items that were being advertised for black friday and refused to place orders and the sale price. i waited in line for 2 hours to purchase another version of the item i originally went to just to listen to every single customer complaining about something that the store was mis-advertising or refusing services for. when i finally got to the check out line the lady rang my item up as pick up instead of take out. so i watched them take my item away from me so i had to pull around back and wait in yet another long line of complaints from customers receiving the wrong item or not receiving their item at all. i had my item in my hand but had to wait to pick it up!! not to mention that when i first arrived at the store i asked a salesperson about the item i was looking for to which he gave me some nonsense answer. i will definitely not be returning here.
1-star,0,"argh! thought i could get some simple tires put on my car at this location. not a chance! they took forever and now the car shakes going down the road. also, when trying to get it fixed, they made me wait for days! forget going back....need to find another place to get my car balanced now."
5-star,1,"took my wife in as a lark, to maybe find a wedding dress for a reasonable price. she was looking for a simple country style and had never been in the store before. let me tell you we were blown away from the vast selection of boots and awesome attire. very clean, and courtney was so nice. she helped us find a perfect dress, and it came out to be just 30 dollars! we came in expecting nothing and they gave us the world. thanks courtney!"
4-star,1,my husband and found a 20 percent off coupon in one of the vegas at our hotel. we were in need of certain items for a costume i'm putting together for him. the young lady who helped us was so friendly and helpful. i told here what i needed and we ended up with a couple of items. very nice store and had great service.
2-star,0,"it's good thing i don't like a lot of sales support when shopping for footwear because no one shopping here got any! cashier also brusquely informed me that the boots he was ringing up for me ""didn't match"" without telling me why (i had a left one and a right one in the same size) and stalked away to find some that did. he substituted one of them and clucked loudly when i asked if i could try them on again and stalked back to the register, where i caught up with him to pay for my ariats, he asked for the ""last 4 numbers on the front of"" the card he'd just had in his hand, again without telling me why. it's also a good thing i know how to check credit card transactions. this was my second purchase there under less than ideal service circumstances. no charm, no third time."
4-star,1,"i was visiting from calgary and looking for cowboy boots for stampede and found a great deal on boots and a belt at sheplers. i went to pinto the day before and although they were nice, i wasn't looking to spend $600 on boots! i also went to boot star and although they had cool boots there, the staff never said anything and it made my mother and i feel really uncomfortable so we walked out. so when we went to sheplers the next day we were relieved to find a comfortable atmosphere, reasonable priced items and the staff were incredibly nice and helpful. 5 stars for the staff! the only reason i took a star off is because the women's section of boots didn't have as many options as the mens, but they also said that was because there wasn't as large of demand."
4-star,1,"fun store! lots of shoes, country/western wear, hats, belts, etc. i ended up buying a pair of ats red boots that i've had for a month now, and i still get compliments on every time i wear them out!"
1-star,0,"first off, there are a few things about me that may make this review more relevant. while i have lived in las vegas for close to fifteen years, i'm an original downhome texas girl. i'm an avid fan of country music. i attend cowboy christmas every single year, which is where my father pointed out a cowboy hat he would be interested in for christmas. fast forward a few weeks and he drops the subtle hint (with a coupon) where i can find this particular cowboy hat. so, i go to the sheplers at this location. there, i asked the young man working at the cowboy hat section about the style that i wanted in a size 7. he pointed out my wrist tattoo, bantered with me about professional and collegiate football teams and several other things before he informed me that the hat i wanted in that size was out of stock. my sister asked if there was another location and when he confirmed that there was, she requested that he call and inquire about the hat we wanted in a size 7. a few moments later, he came back and smugly informed us that they had that hat and that he had asked for them to put it on hold. the other location is inconveniently located inside sam's town on boulder highway. and...once i made the trip out there, i not only discovered that he gave them the wrong hat style, but requested for them to hold a size 7 1/8. i appreciate that you thought my shopping experience would have been made better by the banter that i didn't need, but i would have preferred to not waste my time traveling across town for nothing rather than you know my favorite football team. try listening to the next customer's purchase next time."
4-star,1,"fun store if you're a cowboy/girl. big selection of wrangler's, missme, bootyup, and monster selection of boots. not many bargains except for the clearance racks. helpful friendly staff."
4-star,1,"i'm a little bit country (i can sing along to ""country boy can survive""), and shepler's is a whole lotta country. while i don't stock my wardrobe here, i do enjoy swinging by from time to time just to inhale the smell of fine boot leather. things i appreciate: 1. you can hum along to country tunes. 2. exceptional customer service that stands behind their products. we were able to swap a faulty pair of boots we had purchased in denver with no hassle! 3. unexpected bargains on unique pieces. you can find some men's shirts on sale that you won't see everywhere else. 4. boots! i have yet to purchase a pair for myself, but boy do i love browsing (and smelling). for everything country, this is my spot."
5-star,1,great selection of shoes not usually found in other stores. excellent customer service. my daughter found her bridal shoes there when we stopped in on a whim.
5-star,1,i came in here tonight just to look around and i found two pairs of boots that i really liked and a pair of mermaid sparkly heels i ended up getting one pair of boots and the sparkly heels i didn't want to bring them back up to my room so they held onto the booth and the shoes after i paid for it they were very nice elizabeth and linda and tell me i can pick them up in the morning i have been shopping at the store for years
5-star,1,"i always like visiting shooz (in paris hotel) when in vegas! they have a small but cool collection of accessories. this time, my mother found in the store sandals she liked. they didn't have her size, so they called around until they found another store on the strip that carried the exact sandals in her size. they assured her that the other store (paradiso at mgm) would hold the sandals for her till 8 pm the next day, which is indeed what they've done. great customers service, thank you!"
5-star,1,great selection of really trendy european styles. the staff is really nice and was very patient as i tried on atleast 8 pairs before selecting the one. and did i mention great prices. a must visit shop at the paris!!! :)
1-star,0,rooms are old. bath tub is plugged. we don't like it. not coming here again. btw restaurants are expensive! air con doesn't work well. going back to ballys!
5-star,1,never miss a chance to go to shooz when in vegas -- we stay at paris most often and i have never been disappointed in my purchases. helpful staff -- and reasonable prices. thank you!
5-star,1,"i always shop here when i am in vegas. this pass week while there ej really took good care of me and my colleagues from atlanta, great shoe store and great prices. thank you ej for outstanding customer service!"
5-star,1,i love this store i wish that i had one closer to the home or be able to shop on the net. the shoes-sunglasses-hat-belts are wonderful. the staff is very helpful. i lost a pair of sunglasses and they are assisting me to find a second pair that i loved
4-star,1,"small store inside paris, but they have a decent selection of a little bit of everything from sandals to club shoes to pumps. what i also appreciate is that they carry the foot petals foot cushions which make shoes way more comfortable!"
5-star,1,"beautiful store and a wonderful staff! i'm not a shy person, but if i were, the ladies here would know how to put me at ease. the store is so pretty and they have a healthy selection of lingerie, but i go for the toys! i highly recommend this place to anyone visiting las vegas and the vegas natives. don't be afraid - it's worth the trip!"
5-star,1,seriously such a great place! way better selection of lingerie than any other place in vegas and great prices. i had such a good experience with the help of tenvya (i hope i spelled her name correct). i will definitely be back eapecially after seeing all the sales on my way out!
4-star,1,"i appreciate the intimate vibe i got from this store. they do have a lot of the same products you would find at a bigger venue, but without that overwhelming feeling. went to a grand opening event yesterday which included models, music, and munchies. we liked an outfit that one of the models had on so much we had to get it. the model even helped wifey put it on properly. unfortunately with boutiques quantities are sometimes limited especially in certain sizes. overall i definitely would recommend this place over the larger non personal stores scattered around vegas."
5-star,1,"classy and elegant store with a bit of naughty! whether it be apparel, soaps and oils, or ""massagers"", you will not be able to resist. the sales crew is amazing!"
5-star,1,"sinsations is easily my new favorite adult store. they offer a vast selection of toys and erotic play for both men and women. hands down, sinsations is the most friendly, upscale, and tasteful, boutique in vegas. the staff is friendly and genuinely happy to help, which makes for an awesome and memorable shopping experience. finally, i have to mention the clothing and lingerie, sinsations offers a unique, and truly original, line of sexy woman's wear that will make any evening sinsational!!"
5-star,1,"so when i first walked in i noticed they had some super cute clothing, the girls there were so sweet and knowledgeable, & the toy prices were cheaper than the place i usually go so that's always a plus!"
1-star,0,"after confirming via email, i brought in a jacket with a missing fur pom-pom to have it replaced. over email, they said it can be done through the manufacturer, no problem, i would just have to bring it in. i found out that having the coat received was no quick task. it wasn't just a matter of dropping it off and filling out some form. the middle-aged man who i dropped it off with, whom i assume to be a supervisor, sorta disappeared for at least 20-30mins. i have no idea where he went with the coat. he came back and muttered something about having to find some kinda serial/model #. he wasn't very friendly, just had a deadpan demeanor. very little communication as to where he was going, what he was doing, etc. weeks later, i receive a voicemail, saying that my coat was ready. it was a strange vm, no name, like 1min of complete silence before he actually started recording his message. anyway, i pop in at my earliest convenience, and a cashier took my receipt, and was gone for a very long time, at least 20mins. she said that my coat wasn't there and that it should take 8-12 weeks - not 3 or how ever long i've been waiting. she was very nice and apologetic, but i did express my disappointment at the mixup. a complete waste of my time, driving out of my way, waiting for nothing. again, initial man who served me never verbalised that replacement would take this long. would've been nice to know ahead of time as the coat is currently in-season. by the time i get it, it'll probably be close to spring and i'll have no need for it! i'm guessing that someone called me by accident. although this place looks nice, fancy, & is new, they're very disorganised, possibly mismanaged. every time i'm there, they seem extremely overstaffed, just a bunch of workers loitering around, chatting with each other, looking bored when there are no customers. will update after i receive my coat back."
4-star,1,"i have bought a lot of gear here. mountain bikes, snowboards, skiis and outdoor clothing are all well valued here. i don't buy any non technical clothing here though. that's too rich. lol. i have used their lifeline for receipts and warranty service. they did misplace many of my past purchases but a manager sorted that out for me. now my history is all on record again. i usually only buy stuff on sale here even if it's off season as i'm not really an impulse buyer. i want quality and value. i find the knowledge and attention of the staff very good and when they don't know something they find out from someone who does. i love their half back program for kids ski equipment. watch out for sales in store - it's very busy."
4-star,1,"looking for a very nice jacket? this is the place to be. you can try many expensive jacket without the feeling of salesman eyeing you for commission. they sell the top seller jackets such as canada goose, mackage, woolrich, marc new york, etc. they also have a variety of goodies such as snowboard/ski equipment, shoes, and athletic gears. some are at a reasonable price and some at a very unreasonable price. you may have to be a very savvy shopper. despite of this their return policy is top notch. not happy or have regrets? return it right away. just ensure its not been used and original are still on. the staff has a very friendly approach and will help you find what you need. they work fast and efficient and getting me out of there quick in a boxing day chaos. definitely, will be back to check out more sales in this store."
1-star,0,"impossibly unprofessional service at the nike cash inside this store. eye rolling at the customer in front of us, then without skipping a beat right after they depart ""oh my fucking god"" out loud and laughing about how ridiculous the other customer was with the other cashier. when we finished our transaction she threw the bag across the counter at us and walked away. :/"
1-star,0,"this is for their online site oh my gosh. i ordered 4 items on january 1 and it is now january 30. three of the items ordered were ""out of stock"" and i was notified on jan. 9, 10, and 11 respectively. apparently they are shipping the fourth item out as of january 11, when the ups shipping label was created. after two weeks of wondering where this item is -- and constant emails (as they do not answer their phone through the 1-800 line...), i am now told that the ""item was returned from the shipping facility to the store"". my credit card was charged on january 9. yes, for something that will probably never arrive... they do apologize (which is better than the review below that also gave them one-star), but they are pretty darned inept!!!! the solution? they offered me a 10% discount on my next regular priced order. geez, thanks! will there be another order? definitely not...."
1-star,0,"i had a really bad experience trying to return a canada goose coat here. it was in perfect condition and the salesperson made me feel really bad for returning it. i have never been treated so badly in a retail store and will never go back. this is the first review i've written like this, but it is well deserved, trust me!"
2-star,0,"the salesperson that helped us today was stephan and he was great. unfortunately when we got to the check-out, we received mediocre service from a man who appeared to be the manager that day. he grew impatient when it turned out that my second gift card had a problem (while the first gift card worked). he requested to see my id in a distrusting tone and then also suggested in a condescending tone to pay the balance with another form of payment and come back when i get my gift card sorted out. however, i did not see a line-up at the cash registers as there were several cashiers to serve customers. this has left me with a bad impression of the store and i will reconsider buying from this store again when i purchase my next $800+ coat."
5-star,1,"i was turned off completely by visiting retailers for ski/snowboard gear, but descente's website said to visit sporting life.... so fine. fineeeeeeeeeee and right when i walked in, i was so happy to see so many brands and many modern/up-to-date styles for outdoor clothing! did i see a spyder jacket in size xs, and did i see two? did i see reasonable prices (given this is really what you'd pay for anyways....)? yes. and yes! and yes i walked out with some sexy tight-fitting spyder snowpants. i was able to pick between size 4 and 6! if it's not available in my size, the staff offers to call the yonge location and send one over. which they did. it was as short as one day for delivery, so i was able to try on my jacket quite soon! i did not feel pressured to buy anything. really liked the staff here! except probably the cashier ladies."
5-star,1,great place for a bike tune up. had to bring my refurbed bike in after my last one got stolen (which had just been tuned up here too!). spoke with asa both times and he's super helpful and attentive. definitely suggest these guys to anyone inquiring. good pricing too! a tune up starts at $60 and other local shops i've looked at we're $100+
5-star,1,sagi ( sorry if the spelling is incorrect) helped us out this morning & was fantastic. he seems to live his job& made my 17 year old daughter feel like a princess. will be back to see him due to the impeccable attention & service.
5-star,1,"i went in this store to simply browse and in less than 10 minutes i was in a dressing room with dresses hand picked for me. ricardo was perfect and on point with his selections. after getting back to our room eager to wear it for our night out i noticed a hole in the hip area through the sheer fabric. unaware if i was at fault for this during trying it on snagging it in the hotel room or what not, i reluctantly went back in to stash to ask about the exchange policy. they happily agreed and shipped out a replacement. spending 250.00 on a dress with this kind of service is definitely worth it. they have earned a loyal and return customer for sure!"
5-star,1,"the staff here rocks! funny, sweet and they will tell you what looks good and what does not. i bought a gold bandage dress that made me feel like a million bucks. so instead of spending 1k on an herve leger i spent 250 and got an amazing dress that fits like a glove."
4-star,1,"still lovin' this store, as it still has lots of funky clothes (especially dresses, and bling jewelry!), and the lady who works here is lovely (i think her name is belle. long red hair. super super nice!). and the dressing rooms are fantastic, large, with upholstered plush chairs for folks to hang with you as you try on clothes, and thick velvet curtain ""doors"". very dramatic and fun! my only issue is, on my last visit here, i fell in love with a black tank top with a bling gold perfume bottle emblazoned on the front. it didn't work for me (unfortunately). but later that day i saw the exact same top in another store in this miracle mile complex for nearly $20 less! wow, that's a substantial difference. so i'll be more wary of pricing here on future visits."
5-star,1,"you know what makes a clothing store stand out from the rest? superb customer service: staff who who not only welcome you, but pick out clothing for you! i found this store because of all of their great yelp reviews. not only did i buy a great outfit, but i also got a friend to buy a great outfit as well! i will definitely come back on my next trip to vegas!"
5-star,1,came in to buy clothes for a night out with the boys at the club. the selection was great and the customer service was through the roof! they turned the miserable experience of buying clothes into something that i could actually look forward to again. i'll be back soon to shop more!
5-star,1,"inside planet hollywood, if you are looking for the not so ordinary this is the place. ricardo was the best. i was undecided about which awesomeness to purchase for my evening event. they have so many to choose from. jewels, lace or tulle you will not be disappointed. after much discussion and a whole heap of mind blowing conversation about which dress would fit my figure, i walled out completely satisfied. the dress can be special ordered and in store within 4 business days. i am so excited! thank you for your expertise, ricardo!"
5-star,1,"i came to vegas on vacation with no plan to purchase a dress even though i would be needing one soon for the marine corps ball. not only did i find a fantastic dress at a good price, but ricardo was a very friendly, helpful employee. he sold me on the dress without being annoying or pushy. i am actually amazed there is a bad review about him at all. if i lived near by i would definitely shop here more often and want his help each time. overall it is a great store with great employees! :) i highly recommend it!"
1-star,0,"i went to this store for alterations to jeans that my husband and i had purchased. this place was recommended to us. when we arrived, we were completely ignored by one of the salespeople. the two other sales people were better, but one was giving advice to a woman telling her something looked great on her when it clearly did not. when the alterations woman approached me, she was very gruff and bent over asking me lazily if where i rolled my jeans was where i wanted the hem. ??? i asked how much the charge would be and she said $30! we were told $15 before going... i'm not paying that for a simple hem. as we walked out, one of the sales people asked me why i was leaving. i told him we were misquoted. he said the charge is supposed to be $25. i told him the alterations woman told me $30... all around terrible experience. this is the type of place that has sales people that will kiss your butt if you have an alternative lifestyle, but if you're married with children, forget it."
4-star,1,"i fell on this store by accident. i was across the way, spilled coffee on myself and went to stash to grab a top. they have amazing jeans, super cute tanks and the best sales people! the guy actually gave me the shirt they had on hold since he said ""the previous woman was so rude you deserve it"":) the best selection of rock & republic jeans i have ever seen!"
5-star,1,"my mother in law swore up and down that these are the best shoes for babies and toddlers and she was 100% correct! my son only owns 1 pair of shoes that aren't stride rite and that's only because my husband insisted that he have a pair of jordan's. anywho, they always have a good selection of shoes in his size and its never overly crowded. he began walking unassisted at 8.5 months old and it could very well be thanks to stride rite. lastly, marilyn has been there just about every trip and she is always helpful and extremely kind. i'm thankful for her enthusiasm and helpfulness."
5-star,1,"for the past two years i have been taking my now 3 year old twins in to get their shoes here. the staff are great with the kids! they really care that children leave with shoes that really fit them properly. they even take the time to watch them walk in the shoes to double check their stride and the fit. shoe buying trips come frequently, but at least the process is easy with these great salespeople."
5-star,1,the ladies working there are amazing. the store manager was very friendly. lots of patience considering i went with my 4yr old and my 2 yr.
1-star,0,"be wary of the sizing. i brought my granddaughter in to get a pair of shoes. she is 3 years old and is currently wearing a size 7. the store clerk measured her foot and said she should be wearing an 8.5w. i questioned the difference in size, but she was positive she measured correctly. they didn't have her size in stock so i went home and ordered online. we just got the shoes three days before her 4th birthday and lo and behold the shoes were at least an inch too long. do you know what it is like to disappoint a little 4 year old who had her heart set on the cinderella shoes. i would like to smack that store clerk up the side of the head. i think they should train their salespeople a lot better. really disappointed in the store -- the las vegas outlet."
5-star,1,"both of my kids have wide feet; stride rite makes great shoes for them. if you sign up for their rewards program, they will send you coupons. this location always seems to have a better selection than the other store at the north outlet center. we are regular customers here."
5-star,1,this kid of mine is growing like crazy! i swear i spend a fortune on his footwear! i brought him in to get measured since his shoes were getting a little snug. they take such good care of me there. i just love shopping for shoes for him..and he actually likes it as well. i score two pairs of sperry's for him..buy one get one pair 50% off! score. i walk out feeling like a good mommy shopping here.. see ya in a few months..after the next growth spurt.
1-star,0,"walked into this place, waited at the counter for a good minute while the attendant looked down at her phone and typed incessantly, not acknowledging my existence. talk about rude. walked right back out, too bad i never even had a chance to review their product, but if that's the way they treat their customers, then i'd rather not spend any time or $ there."
5-star,1,i like getting my hair cut and styled by joshua. he is so knowledgeable that he taught me new things about hair products and styling as well as a great cut. even 4 months after my hair cut my friends still ask me if i just got it cut because the layers add so much dimension and grow out so well. i would recommend him.
5-star,1,"charlene's haricuts are the gold standard. i have been going to this studio since around 2004, with some comparison around town. also enjoy a short scalp massage with charlene. they also do great nails there!"
1-star,0,"i had my hair highlighted by ryan and it was the worst highlight ive had in all my years of highlighting. i was scared from the beginning when she seemed as if she has never done a highlight in her life and i left with orange tinted roots. i had to get it fixed at a different salon back home and the stylist even said ""woah what happened here"" hopefully i can find a salon in madison that has some stylist who know what they are doing"
4-star,1,"i recently had a wax with bridgie and it was great. the waxing room maybe leaves a bit to be desired, but bridget's skill can't be beat. the price and talent make this the best place i've found in madison for wax."
5-star,1,"i visited the store today and the manager carmen was awesome. she helped me out and answered all my questions. the staff is always very helpful, the store is clean and organized. they have good deals. i love their shoes !"
4-star,1,"finally! ever since this store renovated and moved a couple stores down, the workers are so much nicer & they help me every time i come in. idk if it's under new renovation but i like coming to this store again :)"
5-star,1,"sahaii is a new employee here and she is completely amazing. she has such a great personality and her confidence makes her stand out. she was so sweet and helpful, not just to me but to everyone who walked in the doors. my previous visit here wasn't so great and i almost didn't come back but i'm so glad i did. my first visit, i was basically followed around the store by a manager who made it very obvious that she thought i was going to steal something. super awkward and annoying. sahaii definitely made up for the first crappy experience tho!"
5-star,1,"great sales, the owner/manager is very friendly, every time i go into this place i find at least one thing, which is rare for me because i tend to be super picky and spend all day in a store trying stuff on and walk out with nothing. but if i go here i am guaranteed to at least find one thing. i love that the prices are affordable and also that it's close to my house. going to the mall all the time when i want to do a little shopping is a pain sometimes, this neighborhood spot is perfect. it satisfies my shopping craving every time,"
1-star,0,"i was attracted to this place because of the large selection of well priced clothes however was horribly disappointed with the way i was treated upon walking into the store. i needed jeans so i approached a lady behind the counter (later identified as justina) and began the sentence: ""hi, i'm looking for jeans but..."" and i'm rudely interrupted with an eye roll and a pointing finger ""the jeans are right there. right in front of you. do you see them?"" excuse me!!! beyond rude. i was just going to ask if you had any brands that run long because i'm 5'10 and didn't want to spend all night trying on jeans. i won't be returning."
5-star,1,"this store has pretty good sales! $2, $3, $4,$5 rack i found a dress and two shorts i only paid $13. funny that this store is right next door to ross. there are similar brands that they sell but thankfully i went in here first instead of ross. the shorts i wanted were only $3. at ross it was $8. they have a promotion going on where you spend more than $40 you get $20 off your next purchase of $40. i need to go here one more time before i leave to rack up $40 of stuff to only pay $20. a good deal is a good deal! the store is kept very neat & tidy which is a plus especially while shopping! lots & lots of parking available you don't have to worry about not finding parking! the sales associate that helped me was really nice. she greeted me as soon as i walked into the store, told me their promotions going on & asked if there was anything in particular i was looking for. they have a vip shopping card but since i'm not from here i didn't sign up. it was funny having a conversation with her & finding out that she is from mililani. so far i really like this store, it's the second one i've been to while in las vegas! i'll definitely walk into another one!"
1-star,0,walked in and no one greeted me although i saw about 3 girls that worked there that i know for a fact saw me. they gave a look like i shouldn't be shopping there. no one was helpful and it's a shame too because i was in there to do a little shopping for my daughters birthday. one thing i will not tolerate is bad customer service which starts the second you walk into an establishment. will not go back!
5-star,1,"ioan and the entire staff are amazing! alterations turned out amazing and bought 3 new ties as well. if you're in the phoenix/scottsdale area, this is your go to for great suits/clothing"
5-star,1,"stopped by suitsupply for a last-minute interview suit. i admit i was nervous as usually suits aren't something you can just grab off the shelf and go. thankfully i was assisted by ioan who put my fears to rest, as i walked out same day with a fine-quality, tailored suit for a reasonable price. we were greeted as soon as we entered the shop, and had courteous, professional service the entire time. ioan simplified the selection process by asking just a few questions. honestly, the only difficulty i encountered was choosing just the right tie. within 45 minutes i felt comfortable knowing that i had a great looking suit appropriate for an interview. i was slightly bummed that they didn't have the matching shoes in stock for my size, but this actually worked out for the better. i found a similar set of aldos at nordstrom rack for a fifth of the price. i'm not really a suit-and-tie person, but for those few moments in life where i need to look damn good, i'll come back to suitsupply."
5-star,1,"as i first walked in i thought that everyone was going to be stuck up and rude, but that was not true. my husband and i where greeted with kindness and the gentleman who greeter us was more than helpful."
5-star,1,this place is amazing. dave is phenomenal!!! you walk in and tell him what you are looking for and he does the rest. the suits are custom fit and are ready in a few days. i went in to pick them up and i bought a few ties and the service was excellent again. the suits are definitely quality and exceeded my expectations considering the price. i highly recommend suit supply!
5-star,1,"i'm looking to separate from the military so i needed a civilian suit for job interviews. jordan helped me pick out the perfect suit for a good price, and gave the perfect tailoring recommendation. i wore it for the first time at an anniversary dinner and i'm extremely impressed with the quality of the material. props to jordan for the good customer service."
4-star,1,"a highlight of my trip to arizona. like many other folks here, i was visiting from the la area and decided to stop by. all of the guys working here were professional, friendly, and knowledgeable, especially kevin. he struck a great balance between helping with specific requests and adding his own advice. suitsupply's product is made of excellent materials and comes (mostly) at a very reasonable price point. the only drawback i encountered was not being able to find the attire i wanted in my desired size, despite the size of this location. in the previous week i had visited suitsupply's other locations in los angeles (venice and beverly center), and this scottsdale one definitely seems better stocked, so your experience may be better. having said that i would not hesitate to return next time i am in the area. practical tip: not easy to find from the road. go to the movie theater and take the escalator/stairs/elevator to the second floor. beautiful location, just tucked away from the road."
5-star,1,"was visiting from la where we don't have a suitsupply yet and thank god we don't because i would spend all my money there. as soon as i walked in i was greeted immediately. the store was very impressive and i was helped by daniel who knew exactly what i wanted and best of all gave me honest feed back and made great suggestions. i was in and out in less than an hour with a fitting and best of all they'll ship my suit to la! i can't recommend this place enough, even after they open one in la i will definitely give my business to daniel and suit supply."
5-star,1,ask for daniel he got me in and out in a good time. he was very knowledgeable at his work and definitely is going to keep me coming back for more. i look forward to working with him further. i am terrible at putting together outfits and he set me up for one a day for the week. definitely a gem this one. good find suitsupply!
5-star,1,wow. just wow. excellent quality suits and service. one of my suits was damaged (stained) just after purchase and not only did they take it back in and remove the stain completely - they did it without charge. thank you dave and everyone else at scottsdale suitsupply!!!
5-star,1,"it was my first time at a suitsupply, and my expectations were high going in. i immediately was helped by the chris. the man has panache. chris is so good that i'm predicting he gets hired as ryan gosling's private stylist by this time next year. he has a combination of elegance & precision in his work that would leave jony ive impressed. needless to say, the guy sold me 3 suits and 2 blazers, which i couldn't be happier about. my friend who came with me was helped by taylor, who was equally as impressive. she was knowledgeable, spunky, and very pleasant work with. huge snag by the folks at suitsupply hq. my understanding is that my friend left incredibly satisfied with the two suits she sold him, and may have possibly fallen in love during the process."
5-star,1,what a wonderful place! it is such a trendy atmosphere and the staff were so friendly and knowledgable. we were helped by a gentlemen named chris. he truly went above and beyond for our needs. we were getting a suit tailored which he pinned himself and also helped pick out the perfect shirt as well for the suit. chris was so professional and caring. they really offer high quality products that come with a great price tag! i loved how the seamstress sits right up front where you can see her working. such a great place. i can't recommend them enough!
5-star,1,great service and great prices. just happened to see this store when headed to the movies. glad to see a high quality yet affordable men's store open here. definitely recommend this store for a new suit. the staff are knowledgeable and the tailor works right out in the open. cool concept!
5-star,1,best customer service and friendliness of any swatch store in vegas!! bryson and atsumi knew the stories of the watches and were great!
5-star,1,atsumi was amazing. she helped my husband find a couple watches that we couldn't get at other stores and she was super friendly.
5-star,1,"brought my swatch in for a band repair. they cleaned the face and i bought a new watch for my wife as well. the people were awesome, helpful and it was the best customer service i have had in a long time. love this place."
4-star,1,"i'm new to this whole ""watch"" thing, but once i decided to keep time on my wrist, i was suggested to check out swatch at the forum shops. the shop (which is located in an inconvenient area of the mall, but i can hardly blame this on swatch) is bright and noticeable, and although small, has plenty of watches on display. customer service is fantastic. the cashier there helped me find the watch i was looking for, set it to the minute, and conviced me to buy three more watches for equal price as the watch i bought. suffice to say he was a good salesman. a week later i realized i will never use those three other watches. i was upset to find out that i could not return them for money, instead returning them for another watch. so the lack of refund is an annoyance that i wish he would have told me. also, a small complaint i have is that there aren't any chairs. i know that people don't spend much time in a watch store, but not having the option to sit down and admire watches does leave a bit to be desired. so, there you go. the swatch store is great because it has a kooky and wide variety of watches at reasonable prices. make sure you are completely sold on the watch you are buying, because you cannot gain money back for it. also, get your sitting fix before walking in there, because there isn't a chair in sight. all in all, i had the time of my life in there."
5-star,1,"who didn't have a swatch watch when they were a kid right? i made a special trip to the swatch store in the forum shops at cesar's palace to reminisce and buy a watch for memories sake. i walked in and was greeted by a friendly sales associate. i told him why i was in there and he said he hears the ""i had a swatch as a kid"" story all the time. i was in the store for about an hour debating on which watch to get. i really wanted a funky one to commemorate the one i had as a kid but when i was trying them on they just didn't seem to fit the adult me anymore. i ended up purchasing a bracelet style one which pink crystals in the face of the watch and a bracelet style wrist. not very swatchish but i liked it so i got it. i was pleased with how pleasant the sales associate was with my incisiveness he let me try on what felt like every watch under the sun. thinks to note, every watch comes with an international 2 year warranty. same features as any other warranty. some features that are not are that they will mail you batteries as needed and rebuff the face of the watch as many times at any swatch store location."
5-star,1,"my visit to this store was indeed memorable. it was when i made a trip to this swatch las vegas caesar forum store this past summer... if only i can die having all the swatch watches all across the globe... came with hubby, my good fren and her fiancee to this store... for some swatch watches delights!!! my good fren is also into swatch watches too... i have been purchasing and collecting swatch watches since the late 80's... and i cant have enough of them for my collection and ""craze"" of swatch watches.... if only colorado has one store like this one... *sigh*... but i heard recently they might have a limited collection at nordstrom cherry creek shopping center (#37) in denver, colorado.... perhaps i would definitely check the swatch watches there for my upcoming birthday & xmas pressies..."
2-star,0,"disappointed- too much stuff crammed into this space - not all that appealing. was looking to sell a few items - woman was very friendly & helpful -- the owner, not so much!"
5-star,1,"i love, love, love this place. i have brought my mother, sister and friends here and everyone had the same reaction-pure giddiness! this is a treasure of a store in cle and a place you can spend an afternoon. the store is layered and layered and well organized considering how dense it's merchandise is. amazing figurines, dish ware, clothes, purses and hats, jewelry and tchotchkes! the owner is so kind and helpful and i would recommend to anyone who loves a little bit of history with a twist! merchandise of all price points and just a really happy store!"
5-star,1,"very friendly management. prices are higher than thrift store but lower than ebay. the issue is not whether there are enough things to look at. the selection of what they do carry is deep enough that sweet lorain must be a great resource for film and tv costumers and prop masters nationwide. much more clothes and small housewares-oriented than furniture-oriented. i see no sign of this now, but remember the store that was here before, the similarly-named but far more sparse ""suite lorain,"" carrying small electric appliances (and some larger appliances) in the back in the early 1990s. the only limitations to me were square footage and my time. keep your phone and wallet (or purse) on you. i set my phone down to try something on. the inside of the clothing area is so busy and packed, i couldn't get focus on where my phone might be. i had to walk up to the counter and have the manager dial me so i could find it by sound."
5-star,1,fantabulous!!!!!! we were on a hunt... not just any hunt but a hunt for the perfect halloween costume! i haven't been to sweet lorain since it was suite lorain and that was a few years ago and at that time it just seemed unorganized and disheveled. also i really didn't see anything that remotely caught my attention so i left empty handed... fast forward... holly crap!!! thiis place is now jammed with kitschy nicknacks and bric-a-brac that seems to go on forever!!! the woman that was helping us was engaging and very helpful even though she was up to her elbows in new arrivals! i made a mental note on what i saw so that when i start getting all crazy cat lady on my house i know where to start!!!!
5-star,1,"the new owner redwin is a blast! great guy and aims to please. countless hours must be invested when touring this establishment as there is so much to see. i like to think of it as a treasure hunt but i have no idea what i am hunting for until i see it! just a wonderful place today, stuck in a wonderful time of yesterday. the prices are reasonable and some are even better. if you consider that some of the stuff you are looking at cost more on the west coast, you would come to understand the value of living in ohio. lol"
5-star,1,"i heard about this place from a co-worker, and from what they said it seemed just up my alley. when he told me they had a big selection of records the vinyl junkie inside me just had to check it out. when i stepped inside i was blown away by the massive amount of records they have. the vinyl isn't in perfect order by no means but that is half the fun of it. each time you flip through a record you don't know what your going to come across next. then suddenly you find the diamond in rough. i could spend hours there just digging through the crates. i highly recommend this place for vinyl junkies who don't mind getting down on their hands and knees and digging through some dusty bins. this is a place i will come back to."
4-star,1,"slightly overpriced, but one of the most organized antique shops i have ever been to! they also have quantity, so if you are looking for sets of plates/glasses/ anything to match, you can definitely find it here. we went here on a date and it was a total blast!"
4-star,1,"slightly overpriced, but possibly the best selection of items of all eras in cleveland. pam (forgive me if it's pat) has a fab haircut and was appropriately attentive and even encouraging. whatever the man's name is who handles the retail transactions is a snarky so and so, but whatevs. this place is definitely worth a trip!"
5-star,1,"amazing selection, well organized. i had an afternoon to kill in cleveland, and thought i would go antique-store-hopping. once i found sweet lorain, i didn't have to hop any more. i was told that the merchandise here is for sale on behalf of many owners. usually, i find places like that are a hodge-podge, and a warren of over-crowded little ""shop-ettes"" in no apparent order. sl has things organized by the kind of thing you might want to buy. furniture, lamps, men's coats, vintage ash trays - the works. the vintage women's clothing is organized by decade! i wasn't shopping for that, but the intention of the organization is commendable. i found the prices to be on par with other reputable places. i bought a few things - nothing qualified as ""a steal"", but this is an ongoing business with overhead and a tremendous amount of merchandise. it isn't an estate sale where everything gets sold by 5 pm or it goes into the dumpster. the owner knows a lot about much of the merchandise and manufacturers, which makes it fun to browse and shop."
5-star,1,"one of the best vintage shops in cleveland! the owner is so sweet and pleasant to talk to! the clothing aisles can be overwhelming, but i have found amazing, one of a kind pieces here. you just have to dig for a while till you strike gold. the quality of clothing is totally justified by the price."
2-star,0,"the prices are high making the atmosphere ""stuffy."". it's not like it's antiques roadshow stuff. so, there was that disappointment."
5-star,1,"very cool shop and an overwhelming selection of vintage goodies. very friendly shop owner. the prices are on the high side, but this place has eliminated the hunting on the customer's part. if it's vintage and cool, they more than likely have it."
4-star,1,"i have been collecting old furniture and housewares for over 20 years. sweet lorraine was a breath of fresh air when i relocated here from detroit. to be correct, this is not an antique shop. rather a vintage clothing, furniture, housewares and collectables shop. greaser's paradise for sure. they have amassed a huge fortune in great merchandise from the thirties through the eighties. the one owner will spy on you asking you if she can help you find anything. truth be told, you don't go in there looking for anything. that thing will find you instead. i could spend a hundred dollars every saturday in this place and i would still not have enough. lots of cool lamps, vases, ashtrays, furniture and vintage everything. located on the very edge of detroit shoreway /gordon square- its easy to find with plenty of parking. a must stop while visiting cleveland. take a ride to happy dog when you're done!"
2-star,0,"i was a bit confused after going to sweet lorain. i should have listened to cara! so many rave reviews made this shop sound not only sweet, but absolutely delectable... unfortunately it was simply not so. when i go to an antique shop i'm not simply looking for things that are old or used, i'm looking for something that is quality - furniture that is crafted by passionate carpenters or decor that symbolizes that beauty of times past. i'm not looking for old crap and dusty trinkets or dingy, out-of-style clothes. i would go to a thrift shop for those things. perhaps my expectations of sweet lorain were simply not fair. maybe this is exactly what it wants to be. if that's the case, i stand corrected. so, if you want to know what you will find at sweet lorain, here's what i saw: lots and lots of old clothing (admittedly some odd stuff that might be useful for costume parties or halloween), lots and lots of vintage porn, old records, old low-quality kitchen wares, random trinkets, low-quality 70s and 80s prints, and a wall of colored glass vases. i'll admit that the colored vases were quite nice but the prices on those items were more along the lines of what you'd find in a high-end furniture shop than in a dirty antiques/thrift store. i was disappointed with my visit here because i had read so many incredible reviews. i have a feeling that many of those reviews reflect the nostalgia of what this place used to be rather than the current reality."
5-star,1,"a friend recommended that i had to check out sweet lorain. i was not disappointed. it was much larger than i expected and had a lot of mid-century clothing, furniture, bar ware and other items. compared to many vintage stores i have been to it was very well organized. i thought the pricing was very fair. if you are going to be in cleveland, this is definitely the first vintage store to check out."
4-star,1,"i was told i had to visit sweet lorain during my recent visit to cleveland - it did not disappoint! there really aren't any vintage shops in the detroit area with so much good stuff to rifle through (that i know of, at least). lots of themed sections, from owls, mushrooms, florals, holidays, colors, comic book characters, etc., & also organized by item type & room. the staff was very friendly, too, which was awesome. the only downside is definitely the prices - i'm personally not a collector, so i don't see the value in a $24 set of salt & pepper shakers, though some people might. i ended up leaving with a $10 record & a $3 wooden brooch, but if i had more money or my eye set on something, i would've purchased more."
5-star,1,"there are a lot of negative reviews about sweet lorain which makes me sad. i have been traveling to sweet lorain (former suite lorain) for the past 3-4 years and it's always been a wonderful experience. now with red owning the place it's become even that much more special of an vintage shopping adventure. every time we visit red always says, ""welcome home!"" and is so warm and helpful and full of jokes! there is a new tiki section that i am enjoying along with the more organized and better lit clothing departments! i love sweet lorain, cleveland doesn't know how lucky they are to have this gem in their city!"
5-star,1,"what can i say, i'm a loyal customer who visited this amazing store back when the owners were women & now with the new owner, redwin lewis. i must say, regardless of whose owned this store, i have always found it interesting and enjoy the unique inventory. price wise, i don't see much of a difference between sweet lorains, flower child or etsy.com. but i recently visited on 01/12/13 and feel that the staff & the owner himself went above & beyond! i was searching for a wedding dress but didn't expect to find anything on my first visit. not only did i find a beautiful gown but redwin searched his store until he found some beautiful vintage jewelry that he felt would be a good match, he even found 3 tiaras and made numerous suggestions to improve my big day. redwin & his young employee behind the counter said that 100's of girls have tried on my dress but know one could fit into it, so they both waited until i exited the fitting room...i ended up dancing with redwin, he wanted me to see just how big the dress truly is as he twirled me around. his co-worker helped me search through their glove selection and they even found the perfect pair of matching earrings for me. they both loved my wedding theme (eco-friendly/vintage) and had pictures taken with me while in the dress. and for just $200.00 i got a unexpected eco-friendly conversation piece -can guarantee there's no other bride out there with a dress like mine :) the only real issue i could see anyone having is that they are still going through the stores products & trying to organize them & that some things are a little over priced. but i've read the other reviews on here & don't think enough people have done their homework, the prices they offer are pretty average. and let's face it, it's vintage- so stop whining about finding tears & holes in the clothing! keep in mind things are priced based on uniqueness, demand, and quality; things were hand made back then - not the cookie cutting crap that's spit out in stores now. you should try looking at each imperfection as a part of a wonderful story & grab inspiration from that piece not b**ch & moan."
3-star,0,"sweet lorain has lost something since the new owner took over. though, he is doing a great job of finally getting things organized. things are now organized by era and type of dress. all the plus size dresses are marked, which is great. if you are a plus size gal looking for vintage pieces, you're going to find more here than anywhere else in cleveland. their prices are definitely on the high side for the quality of garment you are typically going to find. a lot of garments are stained or ripped, so make sure you examine each piece carefully. most of the records in the record section are unplayable due to scratches. the housewares & knick knack sections are really the reason to come here. well organized and somewhat decently priced. if you are interested in dress making, there is a great selection of vintage fabrics and patterns. and the menswear section is impressive. despite the not-so-secret shoppers making browsing a bit awkward, i do like to come here and browse, and occasionally i do find a treasure."
4-star,1,"this vintage store is super fun, although i have to agree with some of the recent reviews - it's not what it used to be. things used to be organized better - i don't really know how to describe it, but it seemed like more care was given to the place. i still love to stop in to check things out every time i visit cleveland. the prices are decent for the quality."
2-star,0,"out of sheer curiosity the boyfriend and i just had to stop by sweet lorain when we were hopping around the antique shops on lorain. yikes. and this is coming from two people who scour the most random, dirty, weirdo thrift stores for treasures--this place is borderline unshoppable. first of all, it looks like at one point in time someone tried to care about this place. now it appears its inventory has been neglected for a long, long time. dusty, thrown upon each other... it was too difficult to look through. certain parts were still semi organized into ""shops"", but it looks like that concept has been long thrown to the wind and now things are just everywhere. you can't even walk up to stuff to look at it closely. i haven't even been to a thrift store this unorganized. second, the price tags i did see where way too large. i get it. your inventory is retro and fun. but just because you call yourself a vintage store does not mean you can forget that your merchandise is still used. meaning: not new. it's unique, but not worth what you're pricing it. the worst part was that the guy at the counter (who knows who he was) was deciding the cost of things right in front of customers and pointing out the most silly reasons to up the prices. i guess from all the stories i heard about this place in the past being amazing made me pretty shocked to see it in its current state. i certainly hope this place eventually falls into the hands of someone who will actually care about it again. this different ownerships just isn't working out. sigh... the memories of the previous ""suite lorain"" must live on only in our memories. sweet lorain just isn't living up to that standard."
5-star,1,"i absolutely love this store. i was blown away by the variety, style, design, and attention to detail for just about every item i stumbled upon. and the store is so organized!! i found some true gems, and they were priced very reasonably considering the condition and quality. must see for yourself!"
1-star,0,"very disappointing all around. had some questions about a few pieces in the shop, and i was met by an angry store owner. all i was doing was asking questions, yet he treated me like i was insulting his mother. i was interested in a lamp, that was out of my price range- and his reply went something like this "" well, i dont want you buying it anyway. people who ask questions, present problems. "" i was dumbfounded. and when i came on here, and found the 1 other review of this place, i was not surprised. when you treat customers/potential customers so nasty- how do you expect to earn any business, or stay in business for that matter? i am a business owner myself, and treat people how i would want to be treated. apparently this store owner does not share the same philosophy. high prices, nasty owner, will not be coming back and definitely wont recommend this place to anyone."
1-star,0,i love shopping at all the discount retail stores especially tj maxx. however this location has bad customer service. i purchased a few items online and needed to return one. when i went up to the register the young girl that was helping me didn't know how to do a return from an online purchase. the lady working at the next register rudely said that i couldn't return my item without the original bag that the item was shipped in. keep in mind i had the receipt and all tags were in tact. i told both of them that i've been able to return items in the past purchased online without any issues and no one has ever told me that i needed to keep the bag! the lady seemed like she wasn't happy with what i said and told the younger girl to call the manager which then said it would be fine and that they will take the return but i needed to remember to save the bag next time i decided to purchase any of their items online. what the heck?!?!
1-star,0,"i love shopping at all the discount stores around and shop numerous times at tj maxx but this location is not one i normally go to, but went with friends and just have to say how rude the staff was in there... it was bad that 3 out of 4 put our stuff down and said not wasting our money here. little courtesy and smile can go a long way! if closing get it as you want to go home but the rudeness and attitude was unnecessary!"
4-star,1,"i love this location! they always have a wide selection of the go tos: furniture, clothing, luggage, etc. the only thing i see lacking is a larger variety of shoes. a huge plus is that their clearance racks are also fully stocked."
1-star,0,"i started going into this store a few months ago, and encountered a lady named joann asked her for a certain product, her response was the biggest lie so i just avoided her. a few weeks ago an elder lady asked her for the same product and to my surprise she told her the same exact lie she told me a few months before. a few minutes after the encounter i heard her yelling at a different customer because she had the product that she lied about to the older lady! so, a week later we over heard the store manager joseph and the assistant manager luzanna bad mouthing a customer! this store is so horrible with how they treat customers! a lot needs change for sure!"
5-star,1,"today my wife and 2 year old daughter went to the location in peoria, az. she had left nordstrom rack 5 minutes prior and noticed an older male that followed her. after shopping in tj maxx she saw him waiting outside looking kind of suspicious. just to be safe she asked the cashier and manager if she could be escorted to her car. a very nice young man named david offered to help. no one made my wife feel dumb for asking or made it seem like an unreasonable request. david walked my wife and daughter out to our car ( in the 100 degree az heat) and even assisted in getting my daughter in the back of the car and putting her shoe back on. i just really wanted to make sure that this kind act did not go unnoticed. it may have been nothing...or it may have saved my wife and daughter from being assaulted by the stranger. we will never know but i do know that i am thankful for the staff at this location and being willing to go over and beyond the call of duty. thank you!"
1-star,0,"i am a loyal tj maxx/marshal's/home goods store customer. anything i can buy there, i get there! went to look around for a few items and was sorely disappointed in the customer service! i won't bore you with the details, but i will go out of my way to never go to this store again. based on other reviews, sounds like this is common at this store. let's hope corporate takes a moment to look at these reviews."
1-star,0,"this tjmaxx is horrible i just went in to return something with my receipt and item with the tag on it and they couldn't return it ""because he receipt barcode wouldn't scan"" terrible customer service."
1-star,0,"beyond disappointed by their horribly rude customer service. who trained the staff here, monkeys? went in around the evening time with my cousin to return a shirt, but decided to look around a little before leaving. the time was 9, thirty minutes before closing. come 9:20 i overheard the woman working the fitting room scorning this woman for wanting to try on a few items she had. her tone was ridiculously nasty and she even told the woman to immediately use the first fitting room and kept insisting her to just ""hurry up."" at this point, my cousin and i made our way up to the register, it still wasn't 9:30. my cousin had stopped at the isle right beside the register just to browse at some makeup quickly. when an older woman with short hair, whose name i didn't get, from behind the register told my cousin and i to immediately ""come on and pay"" because ""the lights were turning off in 5 minutes"" and ""it's already hard enough for me to see but worse when it's dark so come on"". really? i get that you're an older woman who is probably cranky from working but 1) if you're unhappy there, leave, and 2) common sense in customer service is to maintain a good face to the public and being respectful to all your customers despite your issues. i think if your store still isn't technically closed, you have no right to immediately start treating your customers like shit and rudely rushing them out. if the managers condone this type of behavior from their employees, then shopping here surely isn't worth it."
1-star,0,"horrible !!!!!! ! i went in today october,5,2016 at 8:45 pm with my two kids,husband and sister in law looking for athletic clothing for my husband . after wondering around the store my son got a hold of a squishy mat to work out, while walking he was hugging and squishing it very innocently not damaging the merchandise . i went into the home section and come across a worker named carmela just starting me down with my kids .instantly i felt violated by look on her face because the fact my son kept touching not throwing touching everything upset her even more ! she had some nerve to stare me down in my face and say are you going to buy that .i instantly said no and handed her the merchandise . i did in fact call her rude and advise her to get another job if she was so unhappy . after speaking to the not so concern manager and staff i got even more upset!my money is as green as yours and all your damn staff ! carmela you pathetic racist b**** never make another remark to a mother that will do anything for her kids . i would have in fact purchased your matt and had you stick it so far up your a** it would make you happy !! live a little and all of you including the staff get a new job ! you suck at customer service"
4-star,1,i love this location. always clean and very organized. this store stocks some things i haven't found at other stores. i shop here weekly!
5-star,1,"in january i purchased an it suitcase from this tj maxx. in may, i discovered that the the support for the frame of the suitcase was never finished. the manufacturer of the luggage essentially told me to go to h..l. and wanted $25 to ship me a new suitcase under the terms of their warranty. when i contacted tj maxx, they agreed to refund me the purchase price if i brought the suitcase back to there store. best deal i ever got."
4-star,1,"this used to be borders. on the corner of best in the west shopping center, where the ulta, old navy & now, marshalls is located. on our first visit, i didn't like it. why? it is smaller than the average tj maxx store, so there is less inventory. i didn't find anything though. but it is clean. there is a security guard. items are well-stocked. today we visited, i had a $25 gift card (usually i have trouble finding something in this case), but we found a few things, one box of coffee k-cups, two home care items (silicone sponges & furniture felt pads) and one harness for our female dog; the grand total was $17.88. i considered a cute hat but didn't really need it. i checked out the bags. i also checked out the children's socks, the pet section & the home section side. i guess the more you browse, the more you will find. today's visit really changed my original opinion. if we are in the area, we'll check it out. this chain remains one of my favorite stores too, for sure."
3-star,0,"i came here to look for some accessories and cute decorations for our house. store is one of the cleanest and most organized places i have been from tj maxx but unfortunately they don't have much items here in the home department. they have a wide selection of clothings. i was bored so i looked through the clothes of t-shirts, long sleeve shirts and other until i found a cute blouse from lucky brand. i can say i found my lucky shot and i am happy i looked through the clothes. staff was very friendly. store wasn't much busy but when we came to the checkout lane it was packed. waited about 10 minutes till we got to the cashier. nevertheless this place is alright and maybe will come back someday."
5-star,1,"this is one of my favorite locations of this chain in town. it's usually not busy in the weekday evenings and early mornings on the weekend. i believe that tuesday may be the day when they get new arrivals. check the back of the store on both sides for clearance. there is more than one section! i like this location because of the good quality products here. kate spade, cole haan, etc. some great stuff!"
1-star,0,not your safe store management did not call police or prevent a couple walk out with merchandise galore!? you could see than bulked under their clothes and in their hands in broad daylight security did not even try to follow the or interception
1-star,0,"so they say reviews are only written for the really good experiences and the really bad ones... my wife lost a black cardigan (that belonged to her mother who passed away 5 years ago) we walked inside the store and saw a lost prevention employee right inside so we acquired to a lost and found which we were told go to the front ""i don't know"" then we went to the front and the front said to meet someone in jewelry can answer our question (i lost faith by this point). we then went to jewelry to encounter an employee that asked over the store radio if a black cardigan was lost and gave us a ""no we don't have it within 10 seconds."" i would not come here if there was a 90% off sale. thanks for nothing."
4-star,1,"i shop in here at least twice a month and sometimes more if i am nearby. i always find something! i was never much of a fan of this chain when we lived in nc because i didn't like sifting through all the clothes and at that time it seemed there were more high end clothing so although discounted, it was still out of my budget back then. that was 15+yrs ago, and now i've come to enjoy shopping here. the clothes are more affordable than i remember, and i usually get luggage here. that's what really brought me back in. i was looking for the 4 wheeled luggage several years back and just so happened to peruse the whole store, and been going back since. at times i can find beauty products lower than in stores. i get makeup brushes and other items for a good price. the shoe section is a hit or miss. i've found nine west, sam edelman, guess, and other brands here. not too shabby. i like the food section which is also hit or miss. my family likes the keurig coffee, so we've been going there for that, but lately it has not been in stock. and with this kind of store, you never know if you will see it again. they have a little bit of gourmet items too. the store is always clean and the customer service is great. although the checkout lines seem long, it goes pretty fast because they have efficient cashiers."
2-star,0,"i was looking for bathroom rug & noticed they had bliss products & got pretty excited. there i am peeping about when i felt the need to ask a woman if she needed help with anything. no, i don't work there but was in retail through college and old habits die hard. feeling it was strange i felt that way i looked up and it was an employee. stupid lady i'm in my work scrubs do you really think i'm going to steal your cheap ass products? so yea. for the first time in my life i had an employee tail me assuming i was going to steal something. it was painfully obvious especially since once i looked up she backed off. i'm not coming back here. that's what security and your cameras are for. have fun making your $9 an hour chubs."
1-star,0,"deidre was not friendly at all. i brought to her attention 2 huge scratches (not able to be fixed) in a product that i wanted to purchase and asked if they could discount it. she was so unfriendly and embarrassed me, as if i was asking something totally ridiculous. she told me, ""we don't discount for things like that"". i would've got a different product, but this was the last one. she single handedly made my unusually nice trip to tj maxx terrible."
5-star,1,i rushed into the store on our way to a wedding to find some jewelry to match my dress and the lady behind the counter helped me pick out the most beautiful necklaces and earnings to match... i wish i would have gotten her name because she was great and even out them on me because my nails were to long and i was rushing to not be late. fabulous service from her i was so thankful she was there to help me
3-star,0,"it's a new store and seems much more spacious, brighter, and more organized than all the other tjxs i've been to in vegas. nothing was strewn around, and the home department was much more appealing than in their other stores. the staff i interacted with were friendly. now if they'd spend a few bucks and use price stickers that peel off easily, without me having to waste an eternity at home, wrestling with them along with googone or other smelly stuff, i'd definitely bump up their star rating."
1-star,0,"talk about rude . i came in to return something with a receipt from home goods . i was told i can return stuff to tj maxx . before i even got 2 words out of my mouth the "" manager "" rudely said "" you can't bring that here, no no no, we don't do that here ."" needless to say how their staff was just standing there twiddling their thumbs this store is going to go great ."
3-star,0,"good for gym clothes and some clearance items- go elsewhere for anything else. clearance section is a jumble, womens and juniors sections both mixed up together. store has a giant cosmetics area and half-decent furniture and home decor, but i came for clothes and there was no organization to any of the sections i browsed and dresses were strewn all over the place. went at noon on a weekday, so it's not as if i came just prior to close and wondered why it looked like a bomb had hit it."
4-star,1,"was here on opening day, 5.15.14. this location used to be a borders in the corner of best of the west shopping center. lends itself to the discount giant as the space is large and feels ""open"" not like you are crammed in. on 5.15, it was packed with people, great merchandise, a dj spinning and people to direct you to the next open cashier from the queue. today, inventory looked a little picked over, except for the men's department. with father's day approaching, clothing, baseball caps (including some heat championship models) and gadgets are plentiful. the luggage section seems to be holding up with brands like samsonite and calvin klein available in a variety of sizes at a discount better than outlets are offering. in the purse section, dooney & bourke was a good buy, but coach is cheaper at outlet prices. sunglasses=diverse inventory; picked up a cute pair of juicy for $24.99. this is key for people like me who repeatedly lose them; stings less when they are cheapos. like any other tj maxx, you have to be an educated consumer to do well here. unlike other locations, this is bright, clean and well organized. the staff i've interacted with have all been super friendly. ***this car park is crazy! dunno if it is proximity to 95/rainbow/lake mead, but be careful. free-for-all mentality*** welcome to the 'hood! worth a peek."
4-star,1,"this store just opened. i found a marble rolling pin, a marble mortar and pestle, some doc mcstuffins underwear and a cute teddy bear for under $30 out the door. as with any tj maxx great prices and a lot of stuff to look at. the parking lot was kind of dangerous with people swiping up spots and getting a little aggressive. the associates here were calm and moved the check out lines pretty quickly. this is a great location for a tj maxx and fills out this strip mall nicely. i visited towards the last half hour before closing and will definitely return during the day to browse. the aisles and pathways are clean and there are plenty of associates roaming the floors and picking up items that customers either knock off the hangers or rearrange."
5-star,1,this target is the perfect size for me! always has awesome things on the clearance aisles. team members there seem very happy and helpful.
2-star,0,"my grandson and i went last saturday to buy him some clothes. first, stores always have more girls clothes than boys, which is frustrating in the first place. we went into the boys department, and there are girls clothes mixed in with the boys clothes, and not like a customer left a few items. an entire section was girls clothes mixed with the boys clothes, so now the selection of boys clothes is even smaller. it was difficult to find just some basic t-shirts, shorts, and casual long pants. i am seeing comments in many places that people are turning to walmart for their shopping. i guess, in the future, i will, too."
5-star,1,"target stores are the best, and this location is no exception. this location is easy to get in and out. changing rooms are gender neutral and family friendly. returning items are a breeze. i've not used their pharmacy as of this review. this location has manned checkout stations as well as four self check out stations. bathrooms are always tidy."
1-star,0,"target.com pick up orders they do not know what they are ding. they claimed items on my order were not available. i walked right to the items in the store and showed them they are available, including when calling because target.com has a major gliche with orders, youll submit an order it will say it is ready and it is not, then the store says they have no record call target.com well they dont have an answer but a gliche, didnt verify my entire account information is probably why they have major security breaches. wouldnt trust them ever again."
3-star,0,"i'm a huge target fan! i grew up near this location so it feels a little nostalgic. i stopped by today on my way to an appointment. i had forgotten they're on the smaller side. i was disappointed with how tiny their maternity section is. i don't even think you could call it a ""section"" - it was really just 2 racks & that's it. i know it's a weekend so they're busy but the store was surprisingly messy. i made my way through almost the entire store picking up odds & ends & every area seemed disheveled. & aside from the very friendly cashier, everyone else i encountered seemed stressed & rushed. i had to speedily follow an employee around the women's section & basically get in front of her in order to finally get her attention to ask where something was. she seemed bothered."
1-star,0,"my partner and i came into this target and we were going to buy two pairs of jeans each. plus to work out gloves. we went to go try on jeans and i set the workout gloves on the counter where the attendant is stationed. while i was inside trying on jeans i can overhear the attendance lady saying that i was planning on stealing the workout gloves. she called a security guard and was talking to him which i can clearly hear everything she was saying. the security guards name is trent. he then began to follow my partner and i around as we were shopping. i find extremely rude that the target associates were targeting me because i am young, because now i didn't buy anything from the store and will never buy anything from the store again. also i will tell all of my friends my experience and they will not shop at that store. i expect an apology from that store if they ever want my business back or my friends business back. it is completely unprofessional and rude. i brought all my items up to guest services and told her exactly why i brought them there. way to go target."
1-star,0,"my charity organization did a holiday sponsorship of a family, and to keep things simple, we did a target registry for donations to be purchased from. due to a shipping issue, the items didn't arrive on time, and i purchased them myself (so now we've purchased two of everything and i've personally spent over $500) thinking i'd return them after the shipped items arrived. when that happened, i took my packing slips and the items to this target in tempe to attempt to return the items and get my refund. first, the staff was not very helpful, and was kind of rude right off the bat. then, while in the middle of trying to handle my return, the person helping me and the person at the next register started talking negatively about the customer that had just left the other register. now, my friend who was with me had the email receipt on her phone, and said so, but the target ""customer service"" people completely ignored her. so they start taking the items back and tell me they're going to give me a gift card. um no, i used my credit card that i need to pay back for this, i can't do that with a target gift card. they insisted that was the only way they could do the return. i took the items and my receipts and was able to complete a return with refund at another store. i won't be going to this store again, and due to the issues with returns, i will not be using target as my gift registry for future charitable donation events."
1-star,0,"shopping at target on black friday. i have been a loyal shopper at this target since 1998. never again.. you were headed in through a tunnel of plastic caution tape to navigate your shopping we went to buy a vacuum on sale which ended up being more expensive then the add looked like but was going to get it my wife wanted a doll we couldn't find it proceeded to fine employee with add the one i found didn't have one? found employee in area and she was having difficulty serving multiple customers. when i found out that the dolls where in a bin at the clothing area i went in search of my wife who was looking for them i went around to see if she went to registers when i was going to cut through employee stopped me said i couldn't go through plastic tape and i had to go back around so i left my cart then she said i couldn't leave it their so that started it, don't tell your paying customers what they are able to do in a public establishment. i told her i to keep it i wasn't going to buy it when i found my wife we left and had to walk over plastic chain rope to get out of the store what a disaster and total cluster (f-'""-) i will never go to a black friday sale ever again or step foot in a target."
2-star,0,i love target. but this last experience left me pretty upset. i found a cars set that my son really wanted. it was priced for $5.29 after i checked out i noticed it was rung up for $19.99 after having to wait in line at customer service for 16 minutes before being helped. the girl had to walk over to toys because no one was responding to her call to check. she comes back with some toy cars that were not even near where this box of cars were and said it was for these next to them it was just pushed over so it isn't that price. so my son then had to give back the cars as i couldn't afford to spend $20 for them. he was so heart broken and as she had to take it from his hands he was bawling and so upset. i get it that it was priced wrong on the shelf and that's a significant price difference. but not only did she lie saying that the ones it was priced for was right next to it (and it wasn't). she wouldn't honor the mistake made by the store especially when it was priced and more than 4 of them were in that spot. but ultimately the fact that she had to take it from my son and watch him sit on the floor bawling over having to give it back to them and being so upset. i couldn't get him out of the store because of how upset he was. the lady behind us even offered to buy it for us after having watched the whole thing. it's was just very unsettling. it is hard enough to take a toddler to the store let alone allowing him to pick out a toy then having to give it back and not understanding why.
2-star,0,"my dads birthday is tomorrow, & i must work tomorrow unfortunately & came to target to purchase a camera for his birthday. i looked at a specific camera and they stated they did not have it available. so out of desperation i just picked another camera, they did not have that either. i then picked another camera, & they did not have that either. they literally had no camera selection available or perhaps in stock. these are expensive electronic items, i feel like it's quite inconvenient for them to run out of electronics. & even worse every single type of camera. will not come back."
1-star,0,"i wish there was a way to comment about the pharmacy alone. target itself is fine...however, the fact that they switched to cvs pharmacy within target is upsetting and frustrating. prices have gone up. waits have gone up. the staff don't know how to use the new computer system, nor are they very friendly. it sure was great using the target pharmacy before they switched over. now we'll be going back walgreens."
2-star,0,"my family used to shop target all the time, but only shop specific advertised items now. here are some of the reasons that target has dropped off my routine shopping circuit: *since they closed their garden centers, you can no longer park close to where you plan on making purchases in the store. this is difficult for the mobility impaired who then have to traipse through the entire huge space of this big box store to get what they need. *checkout lanes are understaffed. lines get absurdly long. again, this is worse now that the garden centers have closed. the check out in the garden center took some of the pressure off of the main checkout lanes. *target used to have great clearance sales with 75% off of clearance items. the ""clearance"" shelves are now packed with merchandise that is 15-30% off full retail price. heck, that doesn't even qualify as a decent ""sales"" price, let alone a ""clearance"" price. *today i left again empty handed. i tried to buy 4 items in their weekly ad. they were out of all 4 items. *the quality of target items has declined over time. it used to be that target was priced between walmart and department stores like sears and jc penneys and had products that were more in the department store quality. most products are now walmart quality. one example is 12 mid-priced towels that i bought at target that totally unraveled the first time i washed them (before using them for the first time). when i returned them the customer service rep stated that the same thing had happened to her when she purchased these towels. *employees had about 1/3 of the aisles blocked with boxes for restocking the shelves (why the heck can't they do this before the customers are in the store?). *let's not forget the ""joy"" of identity theft generated by their massive data breach that they waited months to alert the public and victims to. *one of the reasons for visiting this store today is that their web site states that this store has a photo center. ha! ha! fooled me. what they have is a self-serve kiosk and no one to help you if you run into problems. i ended up going to walgreens to get my photo work done. interestingly, it was less expensive to get my 12 photo enlargements at walgreens due to a flyer discount of 33% on all photo enlargements--plus i got personal, human assistance. sigh, another decent store goes down the drain."
4-star,1,what can i say...it's target. who doesn't love target!? i enjoy this location because it's separate from any major shopping plaza's so i don't have to deal with a huge crowd of cars trying to enter the parking lot. i do however find that the parking lot here is a bit small. granted there is ample space around the building. but there's just 3 short rows located right in front of the door. which is ideal parking space for arizona summers. the actual store itself is always clean and for the most part always stocked. they have great employees that are always helpful.

1-star,0,poor customer service due to failure to remove a sign that i clearly have a picture of that should have not been placed or lifted there manager rebecca was very rude with providing a discount or the gift card that the end cab stated will not be visiting this location again due to rudeness and failure to meet customer service needs
4-star,1,"a small but quaint target, i love that i can shop for everything that i need in a hurry without feeling like i need to cross the sahara desert to get the things i need. there is a fry's marketplace across the street, so you can get all of your shopping done in one trip!"
2-star,0,"they have the fitbit aria scale here! so it's $129.99. the fitbit flex in slate or violet is $99.99. yeesh! i don't shop here routinely but this is one of the stores i come to purchase cd's when they're on sale. for whatever reason they have a much better selection than mall wart and they usually have a new release, that i might like, at a low price every couple of months. what i don't like about target is their cheezy baskets of seasonal items on display near the entrance. lots of poor quality, made in china items, sold for next to nothing. i see most of this stuff as waste that frequently winds up at goodwill and/or landfills. the store is generally clean and shelves stocked. the staff is pleasant enough. not sure how much profit they've generated now that all employees walk around attached to walkie talkies (you remember those right? i mean you're old enough to remember those, right?), but wish they could turn the volume down on the things and possibly refrain from following me while talking on them. i always turn around to see if they're talking to me because like i said, i don't shop here regularly."
4-star,1,this used to be where the students went before tempe marketplace opened. the staff here are always friendly and the crowd is older tempe. they could use an update but they are way better than the one on longmore. this target has everything i need!
4-star,1,when they have shopping door busters i like this target cuz its not too busy and i am usually first in line or one of very few. who doesnt like target?
4-star,1,"this is the target we used to shop at when i was a kid. sure it isn't as large, nor does it have the shiny new sheen of the target at tempe marketplace, but it still holds the charm and memories of random shopping trips of a bygone era. employees are friendly, and it's easy to navigate through the aisles. another plus is that this location isn't as busy, and you don't have to battle with the tempe marketplace traffic if all you need are random household items just from target!"
3-star,0,"now let me just start by saying i freaking love target. okay, so anyway. i can't believe i'm the first person to review this location, it's an ancient store compared to the new ones. don't tlet that fool you though, it is remodeled. the store remodel is a good and a bad thing however. i just moved to this area recently so i'm not sure in what shape this store was before the facelift, but i'm sure it needed it. very nice and refreshed inside, clean, your typical target red everywhere. it's already a kinda weird layout to begin with seeing as this location is set up as a square rather than a normal, longer rectangle most target stores are layed out as, but in the remodel they added a grocery section with fresh food and more pantry options. i'd add a star for that and the added convienence the extra grocery brings now that it is a p-fresh location like all other target's have become, but in order to add that larger grocery area they've had to significantly shrink other departments in the store to compensate, so minus extra star we just added. moral of the story here is this target is great if you just need to run in for a few basics, but if you have detailed shopping or you're looking for something specific it's probably a better idea to drive either way on mcclintock to the tempe marketplace target or chandler santan target. this location is still nice to get you by though. they have a food court with pizza hut express, pharmacy tucked way back in the corner, and a nice photo lab up by the front door, which is my favorite thing here. they took photo out of most target stores so it's nice this has one being closest to my house to just ride up quickly and print out a few pics! overall just a very standard, plain target store. nothing too special here. just enought to get you through the week."
4-star,1,"this is always our 2nd choice target. if we cant find something at the tmp location, we come here. the staff here is always friendly, albiet a bit strange. i always kind of feel like this target is set up differently than other locations. i always for get that theres more to it while walking thru."
3-star,0,"this review is not for the store, because the store is fine and i like it. even though there is no starbucks here. it is still a nice store. my review today is for the pharmacy. what a disaster i had here. proving once again that the target store on 44th street is the very best one to go to for your scripts. i came here on the 4th to drop off 2 scripts to be filled. they did not have one of them and so they would have to order it. fair enough, i understand that. great,i will pick them both up on saturday. they called me on friday which was very nice to say they did not receive the item and would get it on tuesday. thank you for calling me and saving me time. i am very grateful for that. so tuesday afternoon i go to target to get my 2 scripts. ryan, my cashier finds them, rings them up,i pay, and then he disappears without telling me what is going on and not giving me my scripts.???? i am standing at the counter waiting not knowing what exactly is going on. in the mean time, down the other end of the glassed in counter,2 men are leaning over the glass talking to the female pharmacist. about what i don't know but, they are not in uniform, so i am guessing they do not work there. another cashier(female) asks me, have i been helped. well,yes, and i have paid,but, i do not have my pills and not sure what is going on. she leaves to ask,as now ryan is also down the other end with the the pharmacist and the 2 men leaning over the glass portion. one of the men,not in uniform yells down to me, she is changing your pills,it will just be a min. wtf?? people i never say this, but this was the worst customer service ever and it gets better. who is that guy and why does he have his hand in my dealings??? ryan comes back and apologizes for going mia and explains that they had given me the wrong thing. yeah ryan for catching that for me. so i really do not blame him. i am grateful that he caught it. then comes the pharmacist, alda,or something similar. she says have my name then i come up to the counter and she starts yelling at the cash register. it just goes on and on,i don't want to bore you with all the details. all i can say is not professional. i did not like the entire episode so i won't be getting any scripts there again. sorry for so long of a story. but, when it comes to medical of any kind. i want professionalism."
5-star,1,been coming to this location since i moved to this side of town in 1998. employees are always glad to help. the pharmacy is quick and gives you calls when your prescription is ready for pick up. i love the fresh produce section that was recently added this past year. great selections great prices.
4-star,1,"this target gets the job done. their shelves tend to be in a little disarray, and their makeup selections are generally lacking, but other than superfluous purchases i didn't even need to make, this target has never let me down. the grocery section is probably the cleanest and best in the store. i love perusing these aisles. their clothing section is pretty diverse, but because the store is somewhat small, it's packed in tight. it's a challenge to maneuver the area. the biggest perk is its central location to southern tempe. it's also very rarely busy during the day, which is awesome!"
1-star,0,"i do not like this target. the team members are unhelpful in helping you find the item that you are looking for. they stand there saying um we don't carry it, several minuts later i found the item after the team member flat out lied. after look for my self i found the item. lazy team member in house wares. target expect less, pay more!"
5-star,1,"i love target!!!!! ok, now that i have that out of my system, lets review why i love this one so much. a) its target and they carry everything b) thier awesome c) i want to buy everything in sight, despite the fact that i only came in here to get shampoo d) its organized! aside from parking, this is one of the better targets around, but the parking sucks here, so beware. go and shop your heart out..."
5-star,1,ummm target rocks. enough said. target is my fav place to go for everything...this location is clean and has a good selection of everything.
5-star,1,target has pretty dresses in there currently and attractive workout clothes that make me look skinny without even having to work it. 5 star for that !
5-star,1,"who doesn't love a target? i could easily spend $100 if i'm not careful just stopping in for toilet paper or something. i've really been into their clothes, believe it or not. they've got good, nice shirts for work - they look stylish and fit well enough for the price, and you never want to spend a ton on dumb old work clothes anyway. i'll occasionally buy shoes here, only to realize that cheap shoes just hurt your feet, bad idea. not the cheapest place for electronics like tvs, but they have them."
3-star,0,"i come here regularly as it's close to home. never had an issue with the staff, friendly and helpful. however the store is not always as organized as it could be. on a few occasions i found expired (even molded bread) on the shelves, and the kids section always seems to be a bit messy. i understand customers create part of that mess but the on sale items would be easier to identify if sorted by size."
1-star,0,"worst target i've been to and unfortunately it's the closest to me. long lines at self checkout with 3 employees standing around watching people trying to figure out how to scan and purchase their items and no registers open to actually scan items for their customers. very frustrating. i'm all about self check out, but when the lines are long and you have that many employees standing around, maybe it's time to open an actual register to help get the line moving. this isn't the first time this has happened while i'm here. after continuously happening, i decided to write a review in hopes this issue will be fixed!"
5-star,1,"i love target over walmart. i really don't care if it's over priced ill pay for the convince to walk in this clean store and actually be greeted by the employees. the employees here are always friendly and willing to help you out. they always have great finds on the clearance racks. also, you never have to wait that long to get checked out."
1-star,0,targets a joke to return electronics. i have my receipt from a fitbit bought for me as a gift. fitbit doesn't work properly and target won't refund or exchange the item. it's been 2 months. now i'm going to have to go to the manufacturer. what's the point of buying from target then? what a pain!
4-star,1,"not a bad target. pretty standard. clean store, friendly staff. large selection of winter clearance which i can appreciate because i live in maryland and can use the scarves, hats, and gloves #winning. produce appeared fresh, grocery was well stocked."
1-star,0,this is the most dirtiest target ever!!! how in the hell do u have baby spiders crawling on the clothes rack!!!!!! i'm so appalled i'm just in so much disbelief i can't believe it . you get one star only because my elementary school friend works there
2-star,0,"this target has the worst customer service! i'm not sure if it's because it's on the south side of phoenix, but i have came across very few employees who are helpful or even friendly. one example i was purchasing medela breast pump gift set i grabbed it because online it said it was a certain price i also looked at the tag on the shelf to make sure it was also that same price and it was. checking out it came up a completely different price. the lady had someone look and they said that was the right price ( meaning they didn't actually check) i told the lady i looked at the tag before picking it up and it was the same price as it says online the lady then tells me well there's nothing i can do you need to go to the customer service desk so they can price match. another situation, i purchased a set of bottles after bringing it home i noticed water spots in the bottles and weird hole in the nipples. i took them back and told them that there were water spots and the little hole in the nipple and for precautionary measures they shouldn't put the bottles back on the shelves. there were three girls at the customer service desk all that was said was we don't put returned baby products back on the shelf and 18.45 will go back on your card. no customer service ethic what so ever. i hate that i live literally a mile away and it's convenient to come here."
2-star,0,i like this target but the return policy is pretty unfair you pay full price for something and if you don't have a recipe they want to give you less the amount your item is worth?! all i wanted was an exchange my item hadn't even dropped price had all tags and they couldn't just give me the size i wanted. unfair
1-star,0,i was at target last sunday looking for a product and nothing on the shelf in fact very little of the trail mix. there was very little stocked on the shelves for being a sunday and the new ad coming out.. also on the floor were price tags just scattered around. i went to the men's department and clothes on the floor and again very little product to chose from.. made me thing of walmart. we went to check out and only two lanes open and six to seven people standing in line and a front end manager just standing there looking around.. after complaining they finally opened a couple of lanes. i hate to say this but this is getting just as bad as walmart. that being said the pharmacy is very professional and always provides great customer service unlike the rest of the store.
2-star,0,customer service sucks here.. what happened to the customer being always right? buy one get one 50% off signs everywhere yet the 2 items i pick from the women's section is apparently not.. even when the sign is right above the rack that you got the items from. they weren't even apologetic for the misunderstanding or the inconvenience.. diane would rather argue instead of create a positive experience for the customer.
5-star,1,"i actually love this target! i'm a huge fan of targets in general, but this target never seems to disappoint. i go for the clearance items and they always have a decent selection in menswear. you can also find discounts throughout the entire store on the endcaps. there's also a starbucks that is opened until 10pm inside the starbucks. this is great if you need that caffeine fix or maybe an overpriced evolution smoothie. let's be honest here."
1-star,0,"this target is not coupon friendly. there always some workers there trying to come up with their own rule, they aren't following the company policy."
1-star,0,"i am writing this one star review because today on sunday they open at 8am. welcome to 2015 target, it's no longer 1950. open your store earlier!! there is no reason why it can't be open at 7am. make it happen target. until it does happen i'll just be going to stores that are open earlier, frys, wal mart etc."
2-star,0,terrible customer service.when i w ent to finalize my purchases i got no greeting.also the lady after me received no greeting.i don't often and wont.
4-star,1,the only draw back i can think of is that at any given time there are only three lanes open. everything else is pretty swell.
5-star,1,"my experience has always been during the day at this target location. i have never had to wait in long lines or have difficulty finding store staff to help me. the moment you walk in the carts are neatly stacked at the front door. on the left is the customer service booth where there is always someone available to help you including returns. on the right is the dining area. starbucks on deck and a mini café filled with yummy treats. then there is the store. like most targets everything is neat and in order. the store is laid out just like the rest of them in the valley. this is a good size target that includes a grocery store. customer service at this location is superb. everyone is always so willing to help. they will even walk you to the isle to show you were the items you need are. yes, the hand holding technique is appreciated and makes me spend more."
5-star,1,"this target store is so friendly! the pharmacy and staff are very nice and helpful too! this is my go-to store when i need something quick for the house, car or for my family."
2-star,0,i come to this target just to avoid the long lines and the ghetto people from walmart down the street from my house in laveen since it's the closes one to me. seems like they're always out of stock on the things that i need now. i used to like coming here but this target location is starting to become as ghetto as the walmart in laveen and the bathroom is disgusting and stinks like crap!! yuck! i would hold my pee if i was you unless you're a guy and are able to stand up peeing.
5-star,1,i love this store! always clean and staff is always friendly. it is my favorite place to buy things i don't need. i like to shop the clearance sections at the ends of the aisles. i use the target cartwheel app and my redcard to save even more.
3-star,0,this target has been my go-to location for quite some time. i have never really had any issues here and anytime i have had to deal with customer service they have always been helpful and accommodating. the layout here is pretty standard and this location is always pretty clean. pretty middle of the road on this one. nothing spectacular but nothing bad either. i will continue to come here when i need something they might carry and i will always come here over going to walmart. that is for sure! ps. i got the red card that is tied to your debit/checking account and outside of initial issues with activation have not had any problems since.
5-star,1,"probably the best target store in arizona. though not perfect, the employees seem to always ask me if i need help. great customer service or guess service as they say. the starbuck baritas are great too. never been to a target store, that was a bad experience."
4-star,1,"after landing in phoenix for vacation, one of the first things i did was look up the location of the closest target so that i could pick up a few necessities. for a sunday, late morning, the store only had a handful of shoppers. the store was clean and well organized and i was able to find everything that i needed. cashier was friendly as well."
3-star,0,"organized, clean. good selection, reasonable prices. found hello panda cookies in the dollar section upon entrance. clean bathrooms with energy efficient dryer. quick or short lines at the register. overall good service. it's sort of far from the house so we don't go often but when we do it's a good experience. edit (2017) had to edit my ""helpful staff"" comment. i went in and spent a fair amount on discount clearance items. even had a comment from the cashier ""that's a lot"". everything was scanned while the cashier talked with another worker (who didn't appear to have a task), while another 5 or so workers stood at the end of the 3 or 4 open registers conversing. everything priced correctly, my coupons went in easily and i paid. i picked up my bags and placed them in my cart, counted and looked back as he began to scan the next person. assuming i had everything i left and walked to my car to be shortly met with the customers from behind me in line letting me know i left one bag at the cash register. i said thanks and ran back inside to find that the cashier had handed it off to the other worker who had passed me to hand it to another worker who started walking towards the back of the store. i caught up asked if that was my two remaining items i had left at the register, he looked inside the bag and with confirmation handed it to me. not quit sure when customer service stopped trying to return items to their purchaser but that's not cool. especially with 5 or 6 additional workers hanging out near the register who could have gone outside and tried to get the bag to me or taken the items to customer service in anticipation that i'd return to ask about them. some effort on the part of the employee's would be great. prices are still great for the items i needed and store is still pretty much the same otherwise."
4-star,1,"seriously? 1 star because they won't cannibalize a piece off of a bbq grill from a floor model for you, right then and there. and, oh yeah, you bought it there 4 months ago ... and i'm sure you brought the receipt. /shaking my head in wonderment/ this target (""our target"") is a wonderful store. yes, we've had a problem with an employee once or twice. if you go anywhere long enough you will always run into the bad apple, or that person that is just having a bad day. overall, very nice people. i hate waiting in lines (that's why we don't go to k-mart any more) ... most of the time we only have to wait a couple of people in line, and the checkers always seem to move the people right along. the pharmacy over the years has had a variety of staff, but they all have been pleasant and helpful. some we even got to the point where they knew us as we walked up. we've used there service desk numerous times as well over the years. never had anything but a friendly reception and quick service. so kristen c ... i agree with you."
1-star,0,"it only took me one, extremely bad experience with this store to make me a non-customer forever. i had bought a bbq grill there. nice 3 burner gas grill with the optional burner for heating up whatever in a saucepan on the side. i had had the thing something like 4 months. on a certain day, i was hosting a huge party and yes, that included cooking everything on the grill. about half an hour before the party was to start, i went to fire up the grill. nothing happened. i check the tank - i had just had it filled. it was the valve on the hose that hooks up to the tank that had failed. i raced down to the target figuring they would have a replacement part, they did not. i asked them if i could just take one off a display model, i had a party, it was starting in 15 minutes, please help me. the employee would not help, at all. i called for store management and the store's general manager came out. i told him my plight, guests were already arriving (i was getting calls on my cell phone), i need the part and i needed it now, please please please help me out with this! the store's general manager absolutely refused to help me with it, saying i would have to bring the entire grill back and exchange the thing for a new one!!!! he had no heart, at all!! this guy was as cold as a car's engine sitting on a hill slope in the middle of winter in siberia: good luck getting it running much less warmed up! i freely admit after practically begging the man for a part off a floor model and him absolutely refusing to do anything to help me at all, i cussed him out, quite well i must add. i ran out of that store and remembered there is an ace hardware a couple of doors down. thank god they had a gas metering thing, whatever the thing is called. i paid $20 or so for it and back home i went grill fired right up and i got the party rolling. but, it wasn't that i had to spend money to get the thing fixed, though the grill was still under warranty, it was the extremely calloused attitude and replies i got from that store's general manager. it wouldn't have been the end of the world for that guy to give me the part i needed and just get another one sent from their dc. i make it a point to bad-mouth that store after that experience with them anytime the subject of going to that place comes up!"
1-star,0,"i absolutely despise this target. every single time i go in there they are out of stock on half of the items i need. last time i was looking for something specific (over the door mirror), i looked on line and it said they were in stock, i called the store, they then confirmed they were in stock. i get to the store (i live 5 minutes away) ... yep not one in stock. another experience went like this.. bought $300 worth of crap, get home and the dog food containers i purchased (which says so on my receipt) are not there. i call and they ask me to recall what register i was at. is this on the receipt? no. how the hell am i supposed to remember... they then tell me they will look around and if they see them i can come back and get them. no one ever called... when i called back they told me to come in. when i went in the manager argued with me ""are you sure"" blah blah... it took 2 calls and 3 hours of my time to get the 2 dog food containers i paid $8 bucks each for. i'm glad others are having better experiences here, but for me this target sucks."
5-star,1,"i second kristin's nomination of this target as the best target ever! it's a super-clean and well-stocked location, and the staff is definitely really friendly and helpful. every time i've gone, i've had employees ask me if i needed help finding anything, and today, when i had a full cart and left my wallet in the car, one of the team members offered to watch my cart while i ran out to the car. it also has a starbucks inside, which is a huge plus for those saturday or sunday morning trips!"
5-star,1,"i have the best-est target ever! ok, maybe not ever. but the best one in phoenix. so there scottsdale! in a strip mall (but of course) but it's a very pretty one! just south of south mountain community college, the center has some cool walking/meditating garden area between itself and the school. not a bad spot to eat some ice cream or lunch either but that's a review of a different color. so - my wonderful target. we had wine before everyone else's target. we have a rocking $1 section that must rise to the level the store, not sink to it as some seem to do... pretty nice clothing/shoes section! i've found things shown here that i don't see at any of the other locations. (got myself a matching suit jacket and pants for under $50 that i'm complimented on regularly! love target!) even at christmas time, the toy section was very well maintained. their seasonal section is at the back as most of the new ones are, and the only time i saw it a bit messy was when the day after halloween when they were removing the scraps of costumes that were left to make way for christmas stuff. the outdoor area is really big! from rakes to plants to fountains - this location has things that i haven't seen in other stores. and then - the freezer section. the wall along the outdoor section is a giant section of frozen meals, single or family sized, including good vegetarian & ethnic options as well as ice cream, appetizers and pretty much anything else you can imagine would be frozen. a refrigerated section w/ milk and eggs too. in front of that there is a decent sized ""grocery"" section w/ canned/boxed/packaged food stuffs. yes, other target stores may have these things too but a) my store's stuff is bigger and/or better b) it's my target! it's like kids. yes, you may have beautiful children, but i'll never think they are as beautiful as mine - kind of a thing. oh yea, full starbucks and a separate lunch counter area that offers your standard pizza/nacho/popcorn/sandwich/icee options. it really is the best one ever. ever."
5-star,1,always when i come here i am never disappointed. the staff are really friendly and always there for you. the self checkout system is really amazing if you want to use it. the washrooms are really clean and they have a wide selection of electronics. the style of their furniture is good.and i like there up&up brand. target may not have the prices like walmart but they have the quality. price does not always matter at the end of the day. what matters is are you willing to pay the price for what your buying?is it good quality?will it last long?(does not apply for grocery) well done target!
5-star,1,"i don't know what people mean by all the complaints about target with empty shelves and terrible pricing! i love coming here, maybe a bit too much. i find they have a well curated selection of all sorts of green and organic products, and staff seem pretty friendly. their homeware selection is also fantastic and very affordable. also, everything is very well lit, and things are really tidy in this store. i will definitely be back again!"
4-star,1,"big, clean, cheap and has a good variety and selection of items that other places like wal-mart don't. i love it so much more because i can buy everything i need at one place. their combat boots are sturdy and cute, the school supplies section is stacked and has great deals, the employees are a little over eager but very helpful and overall, i just really love this location. starbucks is in store, too, so that's a plus."
4-star,1,"toronto's newest tarjay. a real gem. this is a larger one, i feel like its buyers are better here than the one in the east end. it isn't just like a walmart. ok clothes, furniture and party supply sections. what are you waiting for? go here, grab a starbucks and a cart and play american while picking up some cheap summer crap. pepper points for their swell toronto blue jays section. let's go blue jays *clap clap clap clap clap.*"
4-star,1,"if you can ever get over the fact that this is a big box store that is both non-canadian and possible competition (i.e. something that might make other stores sweep, evaluate their prices, or ask their employees to bathe) for some other stores in the area, you might like target. the negatives here are navigating the entrance on the ground floor, and the fact that it is a big box store with big box type customer service. beyond that... 1. it's shiny, new, and neat. the place makes canadian tire look like a thrift store. 2. everything is displayed well. it is easy to find things here. no clutter. 3. the grocery selection is limited, but features major brands you expect at great prices. 4. they have a good selection of nicer brands throughout the store. once the entire stockyards development is finished, shopping here will be even better ."
5-star,1,"we dealt with alyson in the customer service department and she went above and beyond to help us. we were returned a defective product and the store didn't have a replacement for us in at the moment or on the way. she helped us out by finding something to fit our needs before we left the store. my husband, daughter and i were very pleased with her service and continued to shop throughout the store afterwards. very happy with our experience and will be returning for all our shopping needs. thanks alyson!"
4-star,1,"used to live within walking distance of this store and did a ton of shopping here. still do. great selection, great prices. use the target/cartwheel app for better deals on almost everything."
5-star,1,"always clean, always stocked. customer service is friendly. they need to add more cashiers, it seems like i'm always in a long line, but the cashiers themselves are friendly."
1-star,0,"i shop here regularly, sometimes picking up an internet order. never had an issue until now. on december 27th i placed an order to be picked up at this store. it took until january 5th to get the item to the store, nine days. on the 5th, i received an email, late in the day telling me the ordered arrived and i had till sunday ( two days) to pick it up. i was tied up most of the weekend, but there was a place on their web site to request additional pick up time. problem is it didn't work. started a chat with cs, they said order was already canceled. the store wasn't even closed yet. they wanted me to call another number to see what could be done. i had been on hold for a rep for 8 minuets and spent another 15 minutes. i told the rep it appears target wants this item more than i do.later i tried to send an email to express my frustration to them. no way to send an email, only phone/chat. not interested in waiting in line again. with retail stores getting pummeled by amazon, rigid policies and avoiding contact with customers is just dumb. i spend a lot of money at target each year, well i used to anyway. so long ."
4-star,1,"oh how i love the super targets. bigger can be better. they have limited staff, but i always use the you scan for price checks or paging someone if i need them for assistance which is rare.they always come running when i do the page... literally have you ever tried it?! no matter the time of day someone sprints to the phone to help. it's in a shopping development with other places and there is a limited entrance and exit. whosever did the architecture lost me on this one. clearly there is a demand and god forbid there was a real emergency ppl would be stuck. anyway, the store is clean and items are fresh. the staff are friendly and the prices are nice. great place. so why isn't every target a super target?!"
5-star,1,"i have been loving target since the 80s while living in ca, my go to store. there were no walmarts there at the time. moved here in 92 to what no close target?! when we finally got it i was so psyched. it's such a nicer experience entirely than wm. it's quieter, the shopping carts don't even make noise rolling along. all the employees are so nice and helpful but not intrusively so. the merchandise - can always count on target to have something different and exciting, unlike wm. i am a person who generally hates shopping, but at target it's a genuine pleasure. the store is always neat and orderly, the aisles are wide and not cramped and i love the way they have the produce laid out. i have only rarely not been able to find what i was looking for. awesome store!!"
5-star,1,"so what can i say that so many others haven't about target? i can tell you that with my near daily visits to this place (i live literally right behind the store) that i've really gotten to know everyone here and most i have become good friends with. an outstanding customer experience every visit! this store is one of the most well kept in the area. it seems that the mooresville store becomes a zoo and it's hard to keep a zoo in order. huntersville has major crowds as well and it doesn't help that it is a considerably smaller store with limited perishables like produce (and not a deli to speak of). when you step back and watch how the employees operate, they work as a team and keep a 'guest-first' attitude while stocking or making aisles or displays look presentable. my favorite part about this store is the fact that their produce section is very open, clean, and well stocked with a good selection. you go to some locations and the produce is tucked into a corner and it seems as though one person is working half the store. not here, i've always been able to find a friendly associate to help me if needed. there are some speciality perishables i have to go to harris teeter for, but 95% of the time it is a convenient stop on my way home. their 5% off with a redcard combined with cartwheel (google it if you're unfamiliar) can save you a ton of money if you're a target loyal. ask a cashier or the customer service desk as they have debit and credit options. i definitely applaud the management team here, as attitude always reflects leadership and you can tell they run a tight ship."
4-star,1,"this is your average super target, they have what you want and the lines are short. i love that there is plenty of parking and it's close to 85. one thing i would recommend is that they hire more employees. if you can't find something or need help, you're out of luck. overall, it's a good store. i was surprised at the meat selection; a lot of good stuff. i will definitely be going back"
1-star,0,"not at all impressed with this target. i've been shopping at this target for the past 4 years and it hasn't gotten any better. the lines are always so very long, they have very few cashiers. this store is the dirtiest target i've ever been to. the produce is always awful!! and oh my the expired items!! : / they do not take their expired items off the shelves, maybe employees slacking off not sure but it's awful!! it seems they just push the expired items in the back instead of taking them off the shelves. i have literally found 6 month to 1 year expired items at this store!! i use to accidentally purchase expired items from there often and would have to take them back. now i have to take the time to check everything!! i've even found meat that is expired!!! i only keep going here because i don't have many other options. hoping it gets better!!"
2-star,0,i came to target to pick up a steak and some mccormick steak seasoning for dinner. the store was changed around since the last time i came here. the shelves were well stocked and neat and the store was impeccably clean! the only drawback was there was none on the floor to ask a question. the one person i saw in a red target shirt was in a rush to take his lunch break and moving pretty fast so i dare not get in his way! after a few minutes i was able to locate everything on my list. stop cutting back on employees and put some people on the floor target!
5-star,1,"first of all i love all targets. but i especially love this one. well stocked, organized, friendly staff and great clearance sections (and normal sales). whenever i come home to charlotte this is always the target i head to. the store is located in a large strip mall that has other stores (dollar store, marshalls, sally's beauty..) so you can easily bounce around from store to store, though i usually never need to since target has everything. what i like most about this target is their great grocery section - tons of varieties for each product and lots of target brand (market pantry) items. the clothing section is also pretty big and i always find something to buy. great store, dangerous for my wallet"
5-star,1,"i love this target! i can always fine what i need here! i stop in all the time on my way home from charlotte to salisbury. they have the best selections. of course target is a little pricier than other department stores but you really do pay for quality there most of the time. i love their selections for home decorating. you can really find some unique and creative things in all colors. they also have a really nice plus size selection. and it's really current and well made clothing. now most general groceries, i don't buy from here, because i can usually get it somewhere else cheaper. but when i'm looking for unique selections that cater to a certain diet or lifestyle, this is the place i go!"
4-star,1,"everything for an amazing shopping experience is here. it is no wonder i love target! simple, interactive gift registry, no hassle returns. friendly, efficient customer service. great sale prices and they often have harder to find items here. did i mention fantastic home decor. cute clothes and killer clearance items. it is also pretty easy to find an associate when you need help. it's true... the love affair deepens with every visit. having said that, you can get one bad manager who ruins your entire shopping experience. which is what happened here today, which resulted in poor customer service. anyone can have a bad day, which is what i hope is all the issue was here. often the lines could be shorter. there is rarely anyone at the jewelry counter, and the prices are not walmart. but this is target and i love it."
4-star,1,"clean and neat, the store is well kept and enjoyable to shop at. the lines are always short, which is nice, but the customer service is right in line with about everywhere else's, nothing exceptional"
4-star,1,"best selection around. my wife has already started christmas shopping and bought camera's for two of the granddaughter's. no stores have more than one of the hardshell camera cases that she wanted. after several other stores and three targets, we tried this one and found exactly what we wanted. store is well stocked, sales people are great and knowledgable about their merchandize and pricing is very reasonable. i really like this particular store and even though others are closer to where i live, will be shopping here more often."
5-star,1,"it has taken me a few visits (so?!) to fig out exactly what makes this target indeed super to me: it has a deli. the deli sells many ready-to-eat items including baked goods, salads, wraps, snack packs, etc. the items that are sold from this area are usually pretty fresh. there is also a jamba juice, starbucks and optical center within. it contains a full grocery department (yay!) my only gripe w/ this location is that there is oftentimes a battle for carts! if you visit during peak times good luck scavenging for a shopping cart, ha! since this is super target, they tend to have a greater selection in every department than a regular target will have (i.e. way too much stuff to peruse;-) obviously, this location is pretty massive. sometimes i intentionally get lost in here. as typical of target, service is usually efficient. yes, this is ""as good as it gets"" for a target! needless to say, this is definitely my favorite target :-)"
4-star,1,"oh ya! taaaaaaaaaarget. i love the location, sometimes i would just go here to avoid sitting in traffic. i always spend forever in here. i think the employees are a little leery of me because i come so often. but i love it! i use the pharmacy but the rewards aren't great anymore so i have since changed locations. the staff is pretty nice though but price is king. i love that target sends out coupons that i can actually use from time to time. the prices are a higher on some things that most stores but its not as stressful as going to walmart."
3-star,0,"this isn't just target. it's super target. but really - the lines are totally blurred, aren't they? you have your average target, where you can find some general grocery items, such as non-perishable items. and you get your slightly larger target, where you might even find some perishable (refrigerated) items. i guess that's the somewhat-super target. but then you get the really large target, and that's what is makes it super. or maybe it is the jamba juice in the lobby. overall, i didn't really find their grocery section that amazing. they had a ton of samples, which you don't usually find at, say, the super wal-mart (or whatever it is called). unfortunately they were all empty. so the people of afton ridge are really a bunch of sample-hungry freaks or target just puts out the sample plates but never fills them. who knows? what i really thought was awesome was their specials, especially the meat. picked up some boneless chicken thighs for $2 (something like $1.60 per pound). and ground buffalo (probably bison, but it said buffalo) was for an awesome price too. they don't have a great produce section - so if you want that you would be better at super wal-mart or, even better, lowe's foods. but there are some deals to be had if you look for them."
5-star,1,trc provides top notch service and the best menswear selection in north carolina. the gentlemen here know everything there is to know about professional and casual men's fashion ranging from italian style to southern looks. highly recommend you go here if you have the wallet for it and want to impress anyone you meet.
4-star,1,"nice selection of higher end clothing. staff are eager to help you find the style and size that you need. it is pricey, but they do have nice clothing and personal service that set them apart from larger stores."
5-star,1,"thank god you guys are here, smaller and more personal than neiman's but, actually has a better curated selection for men"
5-star,1,"hands down, the best men's clothier in charlotte. trc carries casual wear to upscale suiting in high quality brands that are modern yet classic. the service cannot be matched."
5-star,1,"top-notch personal service and exquisite men's and women's fashion apparel. if you're not on a budget, you can't go wrong with taylor, richards, and conger. plus, the relocated charlotte outpost of noted fashion designer billy reid is at trc. highly recommended, but bring your credit cards."
5-star,1,"i was helped by chessi today. she made my day by helping me find out that i'm not as fat as i think i am, and found my the perfect pair of jeans. thanks for not giving up on me. great service! thank you again!"
5-star,1,"yeah... its trendy and cliche'. of course it is... its the buckle. but... they also have great customer service, and rarely do i come in and not find exactly what i was looking for to begin with. sam is the best (jeb is out at clackamas now, i think). i usually call ahead and let sam shop for me. she grabs whatever i have told her i am looking for, in my size (or my son, or my daughter... depending on our visit and whats needed) and has a room set up for me when i arrive. i cant tell you how much i love this since i hate to shop... it is the best thing ever!!"
5-star,1,wow. i went here after the worst experience at tilly's next door. chance the sales guy that helped me out was awesome. thank you for knowing how to treat customers.
1-star,0,"i can't tell you how many time i've walked in here to get a new pair of rock revivals, but i haven't been asked once if i need help or even a welcome to the store. going to stick with paradise valley buckle for now on."
5-star,1,"i absolutely loved this store in glendale. the buckle store where i live, (alderwood mall wa) has horrible customer service. the girls that work there are super stuck up, they almost treat you like crap if you don't have a fake tan, bleached blonde hair... i have gotten to the point that i will never return to the buckle at my mall. while being on vacation in glendale, i went to the one at arrowhead towne ctr. great customer service, the staff were super kind, welcoming and they really tried to talk to us, asking us where we were from and all that. my husband and myself were very pleased with how they treated us, considering how much we hate going to our store. i will never forget the great experience that the glendale buckle gave us. if i could, i would only shop at this store. thank you to the couple of guys that helped me find my awesome jeans. thank you for not treating us like crap and like we were just another wallet to be opened at your store."
5-star,1,my fiancé and i came in the other day to find him some new jeans and we received great help from ryan. he was very attentive and was willing to help him find his size while folding the ones he did not like. this location is very nice and the staff has always been very friendly.
1-star,0,this store staff & management were horrendous!! i went in with a few things to switch sizes. that's all just get a different size. char kept trying to get me to purchase other jeans... my items were gifts & i just needed smaller/bigger sizes. left without anything changed & an hour wasted in my day!! won't shop there ever again!!
5-star,1,"jeans here are of the highest quality! free alterations make it even better! if you lack style or have a difficult time finding that appealing look, it's probably because you haven't shopped here! love this place!"
5-star,1,"this is our (me and my wife) go-to place for jeans and they have great fitted shirts too, very casual. don't expect to spend less than $100 on jeans but you will look good in them. they do have a store line brand called bke that are little less costly and still look good....levi's don't have a chance here so don't bother wearing them into the store. the place is pretty large with a good selection. service is the best i have ever seen, we always get great help and always buy more than we planned on and even buy things that we would never try on unless the salesperson pushed it on me. i should start calling this place ""costco"" since i cant walk in without spending at least $300 and a few trips with my wife cost me much more. i actually stayed away for about a year before going back last week. service and selection has not changed, the salesperson always walks around the counter to hand you your bag and shake your hand."
5-star,1,"when it comes to fitting denim over your hips and shaping your butt out the way you need a pair of jeans to do, it's marvelous to have the staff willing to throw you whatever size and style you need while you are ziping and buttoning and turning, and admiring yourself in the mirror of a 5 by 5 dressing room. i give every buckle i've ever been to 5 stars because every time i go into one, the staff drops everything to help me out. and what i like even more, is that the same staff memeber rings you up, so you don't have to try to remember the name of the person helping you. i'm not the biggest fan of the prices of their clothes.. but really, i will wear the crap out of everything i buy from there, so the value pairs well with the price. from my first experience to my last, this store has been consistent, helpful, friendly, and.. expensive. but whatever, i'll go back in a heartbeat.. i think they are getting their shorts in soon.. yay!"
4-star,1,"this is a great place to find furniture to repurpose. my wife buys a ton of stuff here. however the ""antique store"" next-door is a bunch of bologna. i guess there's a sucker born every minute. the squirrley little guy who works there is sort of annoying too, not very friendly and definitely shouldn't be allowed to deal with customers. i find better stuff on the other side."
5-star,1,"excellent place to furnish a new apartment for someone new in town. i moved to town in august and bought a 7ft couch ($50), large desk ($40), and nice office chair ($30) here. best part: they deliver! i drive a small car and had no way to haul everything to my second-floor apartment let alone move it up the stairs myself. they charge $20 to deliver the first piece and $5 for each additional piece, so my total was $30 delivery. totally worth it, as the 7ft couch was heavy as hell and barely fit through my door. thank goodness for those delivery guys. oh, and i also found down couch pillows with removable (aka washable) covers here for $2 each!! if your furniture needs aren't urgent, i would recommend stopping by frequently and waiting for good finds. the other day i saw 8 dark red wood office desks for sale at $50 each, all *very* nice and probably go for ten times that price retail. some local office must have donated them, and i'm sure they were snatched up in a matter of days. to save on delivery fees, you can purchase something, tag your name to it, and leave it there for up to two weeks before scheduled delivery, and you can shop around for other furniture pieces in the meantime to combine into one delivery."
5-star,1,"this is the best place to go thrifting! not only is the selection great, but it's convenient location means that you can stop in on your way downtown or home from work and that it's close enough to campus that walking, biking, or busing between class or on lunch isn't out of the question. it's got an expansive selection of hardware, furniture, gardening, and kitchen supplies! the best time to shop is definitely august since that's when there's a lot of shuffling going on with leases ending and students moving away. by the end of august though, things are usually picked pretty clean since new students moving in definitely know to stop in here. i've bought many of my kitchen appliances here for a fraction of the price you'd spend at a department store! and it supports a good cause! a win for everyone! the only thing they don't sell are clothes but that's fine, there are plenty of places to shop for second hand clothes in town. it's nice to find a place that does the ""everything else"". also, the employees aren't always that helpful but most of them are volunteers so i would keep that in mind when they're not enthusiastically assisting your every whim. while this means that most of the employees aren't the most helpful, it also means that there's always that random one that's super passionate about helping you find stuff. i've had someone go to the back to bring out boxes of freshly delivered vhs tapes just to help me find the one i was looking for!"
5-star,1,"i went to the restore looking for some furniture for my apartment -- way better selection than i expected. they have not one, but three floors! the ground level is dedicated to large pieces: couches, dining room sets, entertainment stands, chairs, electronics. the basement is dedicated to diy supplies, small appliances, and sporting equipment: raw building materials, doors, window frames, filing cabinets, skis, bikes, bowling balls, shelving units, microwaves, washers, dryers, etc. the top floor is reserved for glassware, art, lamps, and linens. i found an amazing coffee table and quiet, high-quality filing cabinet for $40 total. highly recommend."
3-star,0,"store review: yes this is better than the goodwill or salvation army stores in champaign due to a large selection of furniture and a constantly rotation stock of merchandise. this was my first time visiting a habitat for humanity store. i still have not bought anything from these stores before, but this place was super busy on the saturday morning. the first floor has a small section for electronics, mainly old crt tvs and other random electronics. they have many desk, tv stands, chairs at very good prices. depending on your luck i can see how you can make off with a very good deal. the chairs themselves were very old and i could not see myself buying a used recliner. the basement has tons of hardware material well organized. on the second floor is home goods. lots of the merchandise on this floor is very very old. overall if you like second hand goods this would be your store. fyi there is no clothes at this store. pros: cheap second hand furniture if you are on a budget cons: very old merchandise hidden deals: the whole store is a hidden deal, just look around"
4-star,1,"i like to go here occasionally and just see what they have. in the past, i've found several good books here as well as some fabrics and crafts and linens that i've torn up and made into yarn. the atmosphere is warm and the people are friendly. the prices are very reasonable. some of the stuff can be a bit run down but i'm willing to look through it to find some treasures."
5-star,1,"this is the best home thrift store in champaign. the employees are really friendly and helpful, popcorn for the kids (which is a helpful tool when i'm trying to shop in peace) and great items with great prices. most of my living room is furnished from items purchased at restore. also the manager is a really friendly guy and is always helpful. furniture delivery is only $20! which is less than i would have spent to rent a truck from home depot which would also have cost me the, plus i have to load and unload it myself, etc. i am truly in love with this place."
5-star,1,"any time you are planning a trip to home depot or lowe's, you should check out the restore first. odds are, they'll have what you're looking for at a fraction of the price, and you'll be doing the earth a favor by buying it used instead of new. the basement level has all the home depot-esque items, from pieces of wood to paint to hoses to tools and so much more. the main level has tons of used household furniture including couches, dressers, chairs, tables, etc. as well as electronics like tvs, and then upstairs you'll find all the normal thrift store finds like framed art, dishes, and various odds & ends. the upstairs part is comparable to goodwill's housewares section, but the furniture selection here is way better. all in all, it's a gold mine. like a gold mine, you have to be willing to dig through the dirt a little, and probably clean your finds once you get them home, but it's well worth it."
4-star,1,"one of my favorite thrift stores. it definitely has that auction-y thrill of grabbing what you want quick (before it's gone). the selection of housewares is great, and there is almost always something there that fits my taste. the prices are reasonable, but once when i found something that was definitely overpriced, i was told that i shouldn't argue with the prices, as the money goes to charity. i can't argue with that, but it did keep me from buying the item. knowing habitat, though, it was gone by the end of the day. :)"
4-star,1,"great place to search for furniture and such if you're looking to decorate your place on a budget. we got a nice 3-headed swivel lamp for $10 (although we later found that 1 of the lamps only kind of works), a practically new super comfortable computer chair for $15 and some miscellaneous dishes for 25 cents each. we were really looking for a couch, and they certainly have quite the selection. some of them were really good deals, others seemed strangely expensive considering the condition (over $100 for a worn out couch?). granted, i'm no furniture expert so maybe they really were super awesome couches despite being kind of grungy. we actually did find a couch we wanted (cheap, comfortable, and clean were our criteria), but it had already been claimed by the time we got back around to it. if you're seriously interested in a piece of furniture, remove the price tag and hold onto it until you're ready to check out. apparently that's the way things work here, although my boyfriend and i had no idea of this ""policy"" until it was too late and a staff member explained it to us. apparently they get tons of new couches in constantly, so we'll be back to check out the selection in a week or so. another cool thing is that they offer delivery service. i believe the cost was $20 for the first item, delivered to the first floor, and an additional fee per item. needless to say, we won't be moving a couch with my sedan, so we're happy about the delivery service and will absolutely be taking advantage of it once we find the couch of our dreams."
5-star,1,"my favorite thrift store. they often have great finds, and i have often passed things up to see them being resold on 'ol craigslist. i feel one of the best aspects of the store compared to other charity stores is there is no clothing = more room for building supplies, furniture, kitchenware, books etc."
5-star,1,"i love this place! if you're either diligent or lucky, you can find some truly great things. and if you're creative and imaginative, you're really in for a treat--a thrifter/diy'er paradise for sure. their stuff is way better than goodwill, and lower priced. plus, they have everything arranged so well it's easy to find what you're looking for. policies: ""technically* they can't help you carry stuff to your car, but they usually will, and they hold stuff for 3 days. $5 minimum cred. card purchase, but you can make a donation as part of your purchase (say you have $4.39 purchase, you can make a 61 cent donation). examples of past purchases: giant antique gold framed mirror - $30 1800's windsor chair with bamboo legs - $10 (worth $300) large turkish style vase - $5 matching antique gold framed floral prints - $5"
2-star,0,"i don't know how this place has 5 stars. it is really depressing inside and everything is torn or broken. i don't want to knock the charity work that habitat is doing, but i would never come to this store to buy something. the only use i can see for it is that you literally have no money but absolutely need whatever they have here. they have a large selection of furniture but most of it did not seem in great condition. i really wanted to like this place but i just couldn't."
5-star,1,"wonderful, high quality furniture at affordable prices. really helpful staff. why drive all the way up to ikea when you can get amazing furniture here? i bought a beautiful dark wood bookcase and chest of drawers. my friend got a cute little 70's green chair and a table. the stock is always rotating so come often to find the best things!!"
5-star,1,"i have now fully committed myself to recycling, at every level i can think of, including home furnishings. last week, i bought the most hideous day bad that was clearly handmade and in need of a woman's touch. for $50 and a five dollar can of stain, i turned it into an hgtv masterpiece. i used two old ikea curtains that i had and recovered the cushions. now, this player is most definitely hated. it's the perfect little sofa for my library. that's the kind of magic that the restore has to offer."
5-star,1,"formerly known as homeworks, habitat for humanity moved and renamed their home store a few blocks east on university avenue (inside what used to be the salvation army). plenty of reasonably priced items to purchase to furnish, decorate, establish or refurbish your home. they carry donated painting supplies, roofing, nuts n bolts, couches, foam board, mattresses, books, jars and even sometimes a wurlitzer organ. if you can't find what you want, ask an employee to write your name and contact information on their ""wish list"" - if and when it comes in, they'll call you! for a small fee, they'll deliver it right to your home. or! if you have something to donate, they will come by and take it off your hands. i've seen local companies donate floor mattresses, model furniture, etc... i even bought myself a couch that was definitely underpriced @ $90. the delivery guy told me it was brand spankin' new and worth at least $300. when i move, i plan on donating it back to restore to keep the community love going since all proceeds go to the local habitat for humanity home building projects in champaign county. when you shop or donate to the restore you also help build a new home for a local family in need. now that's smart shopping."
5-star,1,"i had wonderful service at the macleod store. we purchased some appliances that raj.helped us with. he bent over backwards for us and got us the best price,and cared about us. our experience was great with raj,we will be back,and i recommend home depot and raj.to others."
1-star,0,"i don't normally write reviews but had to highlight the poor customer service experienced today at the home depot macleod trail sw location. i went to pick a trimmer where the particular model i wanted was not on the shelf but the website indicated having 10 in stock at the chinook location. after waiting 10 minutes for assistance, an employee from another department recommended i check with the customer service desk. the lady at the customer service counter was of no help. first she insisted i return to the outdoor power equipment section but when i mentioned that i was already there and an employee had referred me to her, she then gave me the run-around. first she advised that although the computer said they have stock on hand sometimes it's not the case, product can be stolen. then she advised the trimmer i'm after is available at their north hills location in the nw. i suspected she was lying so left the store, went online using my cellphone and ordered the trimmer on their website for store pickup at the chinook location. within the hour i was back at the customer service desk picking up the trimmer. i give home depot 5 stars for their store pickup service but zero stars for their employees who will lie to your face and give you the run-around, especially those in customer service. i have been a loyal customer for years but after this experience will now shop elsewhere for my hardware needs."
1-star,0,don't be influenced by the feigned interest displayed in their comment to my review. i sent all of the requested information to them and i heard nothing and they did nothing. definitely worth zero stars.
1-star,0,"i had a tile install done from home depot 3 months ago. advance floooring is only contractor who are hired for home depot and they are all trying to scam us and they came back atleast 5 to 6 times after me requesting them everytime . amy was the one who gave messages to tim quality assurance manager. but he never returned my phone calls. and i was the one who requested and no one followed up with me. all the time i had to call them, and followup with them. home depot and advance flooring was extremely unhelpful and blamed everything on us we used the solution incorrectly which is not true. here is my story. 1) advance flooring : 1st time - representative name was shawn, he mentioned that he has never do full feature wall install and only has done back splashes, he also said that cleaning has to done by the customer only. it is not in the contract. i paid more than 5000 of my hard earned money and no one could help me. after the wall was done. there was no shine on the natural stone ceramic tile. and when we asked shawn from advance flooring that the how can we make this look the way we bought the natural stone. he said to use stone sealer and enhancer. 2) home depot: we went to north hill home depot and spend another $150 and representative named was billy. and he mentioned us and told us to use the instructions. to use the stone enhancer and th use the grout sponge and from other side and dry it out. also he did mention that once it is dried it should look fine . but it left the haze behind. now dwayne who is asm of home depot chinook is mentioning 8000 more to fix the problem and blaming us that you did n follow the instructions properly, which is not true, because i did first they tell us to clean by ourself. we are the customer, we do not know abc of tile installation. thats why we spent a lot of money but they are the one who is responsible for tile installlation. they say in tile contract only basic installation is covered not cleaning. and when tim came in, he mentioned that it is not in a contract to completely clean. what are we paying them money for. tim also said home depot should pay us more and amend the contract. but customers do have expectations to make sure the job is done to its perfection. they did not level the tiles properly. its their responsibility, if they come in back and orth after cleaning wait for 3 days amd then polish if needs to dry come back. but they dont do anything liike that. we have been on the phone back and forth with home depot almost three months now,and still my problem is not fixed. my wife feet was cut and still we went physically to home depot chinook yesterday morning and told dwayne, we are not paying anything extra. as there have been too much frustration with all this and we followed exact intructions given by home depot. he said that you ve to pay half money again. and also said that whatever you want to do any complaint to consumer court. thats your right to do, but they do not want to help us. so he mentioned to me that mark t who is the head of installation from western canada will be getting back to you and no one helped us. this is worst experiencewith home depot chinook and advance flooring. please dont waste your money with home depot chinook and advance flooring. super rude and unprofessional company, who does not beleive in giving exceptional customer service reviews. they are lots of people who are disappointed with flooring and tile installation, what are they giving warrinties if they cannot back up with their word."
1-star,0,i just left and am sitting in the parking lot seething. went through self checkout and after i had scanned everything through the attendant came over and asked how i was doing while blatantly staring into my bag never once making eye contact. will no longer drag my brown ass across town to be treated like a criminal.
1-star,0,"this store has reasonable stock levels but the friendly staff lack leadership. i was overcharged at their 16 ave store and they agreed to refund me to the correct price. but when i objected to their pricing on cable i was referred to their chief cashier and their on duty manager, mark. mark was less helpful than his staff and kept referring to ""policy"". they are ""not allowed to deal with concerns from a different store"". i see a theme in the other comments on the site. they lack empowerment and the only time they show customer service is when their staff go out on a limb. it's rona for me in the future."
5-star,1,i go to home depot quite often and find this locaton is one of the best if you want to make sure they will have all the items you need. other locations ive breen to sometimes dont have evrything in stock. they have a very convenient tool rentl as well. the store is busy aftersupper and especially on saturdays. durrinfg the day on wekdays is ussully good. very helpfull workers and lots of checkouts. location is on 2 very busy streets intersecting but no problem in and out. another rhing that isvery interestimng is that they aso rent tractors and diggers etc . cool
2-star,0,"my last visit to the home depot was to get a basic lumber load and get it cut, nothing special. getting there was easy enough as it's conveniently located on the corner of macleod trail and glenmore, opposite chinook centre. parking was ample and there were plenty of trolleys/carts for items. inside the aisles are clearly categorized and labeled, but when you actually go down an aisle the organization isn't always clear and they can also be somewhat cluttered/messy. even in something like lumber, it wasn't clear why things were placed where they were. finding what i needed was simple enough and i loaded it by myself onto a trolley. i couldn't help but notice that no one was around to help, the whole area was basically barren and the majority of the employees had congregated around the front of the store and were standing around or chatting. pretty surprising that they don't have more people roaming the floor to actively help people, i could see a lot of customers waiting around and getting frustrated and just leaving because of it. not only that, but not all customers are equipped to be pulling items off the shelf and loading them. i couldn't help but notice an older man struggle with his load, so i ran over to help. i needed some lumber cut so i left my trolley next to the saw at the back of the store and had to walk all the way up to the front to find someone, they should really have some sort of a ""call/buzz for service"" option, as i'd imagine this would be a frequent request. the guy i found seemed unimpressed and annoyed, as if i inconvenienced him from whatever he was doing... i simply asked if there's someone available to do a lumber cut ""yup.. that's me *pft*..."" we then proceeded to the back of the store, he seemed aggravated the whole time and did not want to make conversation. when we got there ""okay, what do you want..."" sure enough he completed the cuts i needed, but he did not enjoy doing it by any means. he didn't ask if i needed help with anything else. i was happy to head away to the register and leave, but then even at the register, no smile or friendliness was granted either, no ""thank you"" or ""have a great day"", just ""your total is..."". i can see why they changed their slogan from ""you can do it. we can help."" to ""more saving. more doing."" because clearly they don't like to help, they just like to let you do it all on your own... super unimpressed with the service here... it's too bad, because as a department store they really carry a lot of great stuff and they have some good sales as well. they specialize in home improvement and construction items, but they have a lot of other stuff for just regular home purchases and non-diy people. i won't get into all the good stuff and actual benefits home depot offers for this review, yup there are some... but this visit didn't feature any of them, next time i'll probably go to lowes or rona."
1-star,0,"never pay any contractor work through these guys up front! they're 4 months into my bathroom renovations and the work isn't even half complete. also, remember do not use blue ocean contractors. these guys put down cracked granite counters, messed up the grout and are incredibly rude."
2-star,0,"this one's for those of you looking to buy a major appliance...typically the kind of thing you don't want to have to move/adjust/tip/slide or install yourself. we recently purchased a new w/d from hd on mcleod trail. to be frank, w/d shopping kinda sucks as there are way too many options. fortunately, the sales agent in appliances was very knowledgeable about models and got us to spend our money with confidence in what we were buying. here's where things go south. our delivery/install was scheduled for 3 weeks later. the delivery company is a 3rd party that will do nothing other than pop the new one in place and take the old one away (if you pay for that service). meaning, they won't disconnect something that's connected, they don't have parts (that hd failed to tell us we had to buy separately) to connect the new one. effectively, if it's screwed, they won't unscrew it...and if it's unscrewed, well, you get the idea. hd has charged us for an install. we expect it to be working based on this. they would like us to go back to hd and then reschedule the ""installation guys"" to come back to do this. before we got into this we were told to go to coast appliances. rats."
4-star,1,"the home depot on macleod trail is my go to spot for home supplies. i recently moved from a condo into a house and have made multiple trips and purchases. among those purchases include a natural gas bbq, a bunch of tools for the yard, indoor paint and painting supplies, cleaning supplies, and a number of other small purchases. on occasion i will need to ask someone working in one of the departments for help. there are always a ton of employees around that are knowledgeable and will take the time to give you a good answer. when asked, the employees will often walk you over to where the products you are looking for are located and help you select the right one. the main point of my review is that every visit i've made to the home depot has been positive and i always leave with the product i need. what more can you ask for? in addition to everything i said above, this home depot was our go to spot for supplies during the flood. we always found what we needed, whether it was gloves, rags, lights, dehumidifiers and pressure washers! it saved us a ton of time being able to come here and know that they would have what we need in stock!"
1-star,0,"i come here fairly regularly now to get supplies for work. most of the time i need plywood ripped into 2-3"" strips. the shop i work in doesn't have the space for me to have a panel saw to rip the sheets myself so i'm relegated to having home depot do it for me and generally, not do it correctly. i haven't been able to find anyone in the city yet that can do this for me at a reasonable price so i can avoid this nightmare. the first problem is that they don't like to do more than two cuts on a sheet, but they'll happily charge you for additional cuts. i am happy to pay, but sometimes they'll tell you to come back later if they're too busy dealing with contractors. when did home depot turn into a wholesaler? i understand they're getting more money from a contractor buying materials for a job site, but if your store is all about home improvement why are you turning away individual customers? the second problem is that the staff are useless. if i ask for a cut that is 3"" then i want one that is 3"", not 2 7/8"". learn how to use the saw and do things properly. this isn't rocket science. luckily i don't need the strips to be exact and have taken some bad cuts just to get out of the store within the same hour i came in."
4-star,1,"i have had work done from this home depot on more than on occassion, and it has always been a positive experience. i have used their installation services on the following: 1. carpet 2. new exterior doors and storm doors i have also dealt with home depot on getting quotes for laminate flooring installations, as well as a new back deck. i have to save for those ones.... :) i will continue to utilize home depot`s installation department, simply because they are happy and eager to do smaller jobs, that are tough for me to find general contractors to do at a reasonable price. if i was doing a full-fledged renovation, then i suppose i would have a lot of options. however, in having smaller jobs done in the $500 - $2000 range, home depot continues to win my business!"
1-star,0,"i am going to guess that the bay's days are numbered if what we saw today continues. everyone knows bays are messy, the unclassy customers throw everything around, leave a jumble behind and there are no staff around to help the customer or tidy things up. what i saw today was all of those accentuated and worse. setting aside the sloppy and lazy customers, the bay has always been and will probably always be an untidy 'department store.' there is just no aesthetic to the place. simply put there is no competition in canada. they have no employees to assist you, there are women standing behind the perfume counters (probably financed by perfume manufacturer), but no one on the floor to help... cash stations closed, etc. let's put all of that aside. we were there today interested in winter coats and jackets and just plain walked out. guess what they have on the rack? 'ivanka trump' and right under it: ""made in china."" even if queen tackiness (remember this is the woman whose father wanted to ""date"" her and goes around talking about women's rights, but is a paid advisor to daddy) didn't make her ""america first"" shoddy merchandise in china i would still not touch anything the dictator's enabling daughter made with a ten foot pole.... ... and i would not even stay around to look to potentially shop at a store that carries merchandise by a hillbilly buffoon. bye bye bay... don't trip over the jackets on the floor as you turn off the lights and go join sears."
1-star,0,"i had poor customer service here. upon finding no staff, i was able to find a dress shirt myself. i eventually tracked down a staff member at the counter to open a change room for me. this lady on staff then hustled out another customer out of a change room so i could use it (presumably so she didn't have to clean it). then left, i had to have my fiancee find my other sized shirts to try. the staff member later came back and yelled at me for trying on too many shirts that i should have asked her to measure me. never did this person ask to assist me or measure me or help in anyway. but then she has the audacity to suggest it is my fault and complain that she will have to fold the shirts later. i'm very disappointed at the bay. it seems very understaff and the staff it has have poor attitudes."
1-star,0,"i know people live in canada don't have a lot choices for department store shopping. maybe that is the reason a lot of sales working at the bay store could not care less about customer service. i went to the bay at center point mall to buy estee lauder skin care as gift for my mother. i didnt mind the women working at the cosmetics counter talked to the elder couple behind me even i was there first. after 15 minutes waiting i was ready to ask for her assistance, she walked pass me to the other counter and started talking to the other customer. i was only person standing in front of her. it's like i am totally invisible. i guess they were trained to pick certain customer they like to serve and ignore others. because of the awful service, i left and went to shoppers beauty boutique instead. surprisingly i got almost 150 dollars worth of bonus points for 400 dollars purchase. a small piece of advice, anyone still planning to buy skincare/cosmetics at the bay, better to check the batch code online before you pay. you might end up buying a lotion which has been sitting in their warehouse for 2 or 3 years."
1-star,0,"this is an awful store and location. i've been in multiple times and every time has been bad service. once we were waiting at the cash in the men's section for 15 minutes for someone to show up so we could check out. we searched for them everywhere and no where to be found i finally left my boyfriend at the cash to wait while i went downstairs to have them call someone. that was appalling but we got over it. the store was also a complete mess and even though it was 5p on a friday (there should've been plenty of sales associates on the floor) there was no one. we even saw a man swipe a bunch of sunglasses off one of the displays and no one stopped him! (we would've said something but couldn't find any associates!) anyways back to now. i went shopping for some dresses for me and shirts for my bf and couldn't find anyone to help so i just grabbed what i could find. anyways i'm going to stop by rant but tonight i had the worst customer service ive ever experienced! and from 3 different associates! 2 upstairs at the men's cash and 1 bitch downstairs at women's cash. i'm completely appalled and disgusted at this customer service in the store and how they treat people. i tried calling the store after and of course they give you the run around. not surprising. the best is that as i was coming down from the escalator i watched one of the sales associates behind the watch counter slip a watch into his pocket with no one watching. so it seems even the associates don't believe this store is worth respecting. dead the bay, this is disgusting. you should shut down that location and brutally fire everyone they are awful people. i'm appalled and disgusted at how they treated me and how they treat the store."
2-star,0,"this place (the bay at yonge and steeles) needs better service. there are fewer staff and cashiers everyday. it's been my shopping spot for years and being an outlet kind of store, sometimes you find deals but today i was thinking maybe with this long waits at the cash register is not worth it anymore."
2-star,0,"as much as the online shopping is convenient, the items actually being shipped are terrible! i've placed 3 orders the past couple of months & have had to return almost all the items - very inconvenient to drive to the store to return. a neckless was broken (in the packaging!), wrong size shoes and sweater had a run in it. the people packaging these items are not double checking the items, at the store (yorkdale), i was given the run around from one cashier to another to make the return, very few cashiers and staff in general. this store has gone way down in customer service the past few years."
1-star,0,"ok i just spent 30minutes shopping and picking things out and a girl started a fitting room for me. when i went to try the items on they couldn't find all the clothes i had picked out. i wasted over 30 minutes of my life because of these idiots. my time is precious i work a lot, i can't afford to waste time like that. i understand they're young but come on people get it together."
1-star,0,i arrived at the store at 8:45pm to just pick up some hair wax and the store was already locked up. i waited out front for a mins or two. and all the employees were not in sight. that's frustrating because i was only going to be on the store for a min and i had plenty of time to get my item. but the employees decided to close early. don't say that your open till 9 if you close at 8:45...
3-star,0,"three stars because this store in neat, clean, and the clothes are cute to look at. probably not my style of clothes anymore, but there are a lot of cute things for my teenage niece. i've always believed that tilly's is a bit pricey, and it still is. a simple dress from roxy is $40. yikes. weirdly enough, i only saw two employees and greeted by only one. isn't there usually an army of employees at tilly's? the one that greeted us was nice and kindly let us know about their promotions. but being only two employees, the one that helped us got caught up with helping another customer and we had to hunt the other one down to check out. tilly's has cute sandals and backpacks, though! but i'm not a tilly's girl anymore, i'll leave the store for the youngins."
1-star,0,this store always has a ton of employees on staff yet they seem to only be good at standing around and talking to each other. so beyond incompetent and everyone seems to just be walking around like chickens with their heads cut off.
5-star,1,this knew tilly's location is way better than the one at boca park. today was my first visit here and i was impressed by the huge selection they carry. the people working here greeted everyone walking through the doors and the store itself seems to be very well stocked and maintained. they have plenty of sizes in stock and their 50% off sale is still going on. i tried a few items on and bought a top and jean shots for $22.00. you can't go wrong with those prices! looking forward to coming back here again! thanks tilly's!!!!
5-star,1,"we loveeee tom's place for coming to our rescue and ensuring my now husband, father, and groomsmen arrived confident and in style on our wedding day. after being strung along by another company we learned 6 days before our wedding that the original suits we ordered would not arrive in time for our wedding. we were devastated, frantic, and completely overwhelming rushing store to store trying to find a solution to our dilemma when a good friend recommended tom's place. it was a blessing. unlike all the other places that told us finding fitted suits in a week would be impossible and did not provide us with much assistance, tom's made it possible! after everything we had been through they assured us they would take care of us and they did more than that. even though we came to them last minute, they were so patient and spent hours with my husband and groomsmen to find the perfect suits. this sounds cliche, but really when you're at tom's you don't feel like a customer, you feel like family. we are so grateful and highly recommend tom's place. after that experience, we won't suit anywhere else. thank you, thank you, thank you!"
4-star,1,"i know people have mixed reviews about this place but it's honestly done well by me. i've bought two suits from here, pants, and a couple dress shirts. i felt well taken care of in my three visits to the store."
5-star,1,"i've heard about this place from friends over the years and now needing a new suit, i decided to see what the fuss was about. well worth it!! incredible service. great selection. i thought i'd be in there for at least an hour but i was in, found a perfect suit, the tailor measured me and out in half an hour. well done. i highly recommend tom's!"
2-star,0,"2.5 stars. the store is very large with two levels (doesn't really look it from the outside) and the selection is huge! service was variable, some staff were better than others. all were very eager to get a sale and my fiance did feel a bit of pressure. nonetheless we spent about $800 on a suit here for our wedding. where most of the stars were lost was the alterations process. it took over a month for minor alterations, and my fiance is not happy with the work. he had a bad feeling when the tailor came out and roughly made a few chalk marks (took less than 2 minutes to do so). we decided to trust them since they probably go through a lot of suits, but it turns out it wasn't very precise and the suit needs further alterations. expected better tailoring as we spent $800 on the suit and paid $50 for alterations, and waited over a month. now have to spend extra money elsewhere to improve the fit since my fiance doesn't trust tom's place to fix it. decently happy with the suit itself, but would definitely opt to go elsewhere for alterations."
4-star,1,"selection is pretty damn fantastic. however i don't know why yelp or torontonians in general think this place is affordable. men's pants *start* at $165. suits *start* at $700. last time i went i couldn't find a decent shirt under $200 i do think for the quality they provide that those are reasonable prices, however i would hardly call it anywhere near affordable. certainly not hermes prices, but i think the affordable reputation in toronto is unearned. that having been said the selection is absolutely outstanding. if you want to find something, you are going to find it here. if money isn't a thing to you, most definitely come here. i vouch for the quality."
5-star,1,"close to perfect. went to harry rosen, holt and renfrew, saks, hudson bay, strellson, brooks brothers. couldn't believe the prices. what's the difference between a three thousand dollar tux and a thousand dollar one? none that justify the price difference. if you can buy the most inexpensive tux that looks good and feels good, do so. if you can buy an italian made (pal zileri) tux, which also happened to be the most stylish and distinctive tux you've tried over the past two days, even better. if it costs less than nine hundred, super. if the salesman is knowledgeable and helpful, the selection and the service are superb, go to tom's place."
5-star,1,"amazing experience. walked in and was helped by a most incredible salesman, joe. within 10 minutes i had already picked out a suit. i mentioned to him that it's a long trek for me to get down there, so he had the tailor do the alterations within a half hour, so i wouldn't have to come back just to pick it up. will definitely be coming back for my next suit."
1-star,0,"i purchased a suit from here not too long ago and at this point, i must agree with the majority of the reviews here. they are very pushy. i felt like i was being pressured to buy a suit i didn't like and i felt very uncomfortable throughout the whole process. i will not recommend this place. customer service (1/5) there was this one lady, she was quite tall and a dark blondish hair that was hanging out by the front (i believe her name is anett). simply put, she was the rudest person i've ever met in my life. after meeting her, i am certain that i will never go back nor will i ever recommend this place. she just stood there yelling things out and answering out of turn when i didn't even ask her the question to begin with. it was very bothersome. for instance, i asked the sales person that was helping me with my suit how long alterations usually take, and she was about to answer when that tall lady from the front yells at me (cutting both of us off): ""1 week and that's the fastest we will do it!"". that really upset me. as for the sales lady that so-called ""helped me"", she looked terrified and desperate throughout the whole process as if her life depended on this next sale. she had no knowledge of suits. she knew absolutely nothing about suits (or clothes in general), nothing! i felt like i was talking to a brick wall, she was in her own little world. i didn't like my suit and kept on voicing this out to her, but she kept on pushing and pushing and pushing and pushing, even recruiting fellow sales people to chime in to help further pressure you into just obliging. i honestly have serious buyer's remorse, and i have nothing good to say about this place. i am not happy with the suit at all, in fact, i hate it. it was just a very uncomfortable experience overall. price (3/5, seems average, but not sure yet, i will get the suit checked by a second tailor) price wise, i told them my budget, but like i said, they were very pushy, pressuring and overbearing. it was like the whole store was surveilling and judging me the minute i walked in. after having half the store bombard me with statements that i must go up to the next level of price point to even make it worthwhile, i felt a little forced to go to the ""next level"". the sales person kept on reassuring me throughout the whole process: ""oh don't worry, we will make the price work for you"". well, turns out they didn't ""make it work"" for me. i feel like the prices are artificially raised so that they can ""give you a discount"". so at this point, i'm not sure how good this suit is. i was told it was half canvassed and made in canada, but i couldn't find the tags anywhere. i will be taking it to a second tailor to get it looked at once i get it back because, to be honest, i feel like i got ripped off at this point (went $300 above budget). nb: i'm getting it tailored (by them; they seemed upset when i asked if i could just take it to my tailor), so i will come back to update the experience as i go. i will be changing the rating as i go along, depending on the experience. but so far, i am confident that i will never be going back to shop there again, and i will let my friends know (who all need suits right now; 2 of which have weddings coming up at the end of the year), not to go here, ever."
5-star,1,"tom's place is not a journey, it's a destination. i've been going there for years now and the store has gone through a lot of changes since the early days. there's two parts to tom's place, the bargain stuff and the good stuff. now that's not to say the bargain stuff isn't good. often times it's very good especially if you don't mind a cheaper suit. the salesmen are hit and miss. some know their stuff, some are a little less able but they all seem willing to help you find what you need. the good stuff you're going to pay for but here's the secret. it's going to be a lot cheaper than if you go to harry rosen. the same suit can cost you twice or even three times more at harry's. then at the end of it all you're cashed out by tom himself who makes every final sale personal. typically he'll knock some off the price and if you buy enough he'll throw in a shirt or two for free on top of the discount he gave you on everything else. the only suits i buy are from tom's place and i've never had a bad experience there."
4-star,1,very good selection. knowledgeable salespeople. bought canadian made suit.excellent quality. they know what they're doing. you don't buy a suit every day so be prepared to shell out a bit more for quality. the only thing negative is store layout. not accessible at all.
4-star,1,"tom's place has a really extensive amount of suits. the prices are probably a little more than they should be but i feel like they are fair, competitive price. i do not feel like they are ripping you off. i have a decent knowledge about suit quality, fit and price so i did not need much help from anyone that worked there. the person that worked with me did not pressure me into buying something i did not want or need. he was nice and knowledgeable. the only thing i felt he could have done better would be asking more questions about what types of suits i wear, where i wear suits, personality and what other suits and clothes i have. i feel like this would help them make suggestions on other suits, shirts, ties, ect. my only real critique and why i am giving a four instead of five star is that after i purchased my suit, they left and walked away from me even though i had some questions about other suits they sell. they should have at least asked me if i had anything else i needed help with and if i didn't, then leave me. this would complete the full experience of buying clothing. despite this, i would definitely go back for future clothing needs."
5-star,1,"i have to write a review about this place because it was soo good. i came in here from a recommendation from my cousin. after checking out stores like tip top, moores, sarar and harry rosen. i went with tom's. harry rosen - suits are awesome, service is exquisite but price was waay too high for my budget. the suit that i really really liked was $2000, on sale. next time. sarar- not bad suits but didn't find the sale price still the best. but not bad material. their selection is different as well. more for the modern slim, skinny guy. tip top, moores - meh quality and meh material. their clothes are starting to become like international clothiers. tom's place: first off, when i go suit shopping, i like to scour the racks and find a whack of them and then try them all on. when i walked in to tom's, i started to walk by the front staff because i wanted to scour first. i then saw how big it was and knew that i would need help. i was greeted by a nice gentleman who looked like something straight out of the goodfellas. he greeted me, shook my hand, and asked me right away what i was looking for and how much my budget was. i told him looking for 2 suits and a blazer, budget - 800 - 1000. told him i also saw the sale. he said right away, ""some of those suits you may or may not like as they are clearance. so some will work and some won't. just letting you know."" he explained it to me in a way that made me feel like giving it a shot but not pressured to go the higher route as well. he then got a sales associate by the name of walter who was amazing to help me. walter asked me what types of colors i was looking for and showed me where to find my sizes and i scoured. i wanted something different then the usual black and grey. he then had me try on jackets and pants separate and always was very attentive. after a few yes's and no's and maybes, we narrowed it down. then i said let's look for a different color. he came back with a few more at my pricepoint and i tried them on. walter was so attentive and always came back with exactly what i wanted. i asked for a checked grey and solid grey and he came back with 3 nice ones. i took a look at others that might be decent but they didn't work. the guy knew his suits. i was looking at some of the higher priced suits as well that weren't on sale and i really didn't find any colors i liked. when i buy a suit, i look at the color, the material and the fit and the price. after trying on a dozen suits, we went and looked at blazers as well. not once did i feel pressured at all. he never tried to push me on a high price suit either. i asked him to bring me one and he did but i didn't even like it. i even found a blue pinstripe suit which i was really hunting for, for a really good price. finally after an hour and a half, i narrowed it down to 3 suits, a blazer and a shirt. when it came to pricing, i was thinking to myself ok let's see how much this will set me back. tom sr. came in, did a price adjustment on the suits, even the blue pinstripe as that was 450 and he brought it down to 300. it was definitely a $700 suit. i saw the same suit at the bay for that much. i took my time because i was still leary about the price point and the blazer. they even told me, don't feel pressured that just because we tell you it looks good, you have to get it. it's your decision and your money. for him to say that made my day and my experience. i feel like i could have negotiated a bit more but in the end i feel like i got an amazing deal with a great experience. keep in mind alterations are extra however they are standard prices. i would hands down go back here again. expect to spend a few hours though depending on what you want. i would definitely recommend people to go here for their suit needs. you have to spend some time shopping around their for the material and style you want but it's worth it. i'm going back to pick up 1 this weekend and will also take a look at some shirts and pocket squares. this place is definitely a gem."
5-star,1,"i was super impressed by this place. instead of trying to gouge me on price they were very honest about each suit's quality - including mentioning that unless i have several suits i shouldn't go too high on thread quality (which is inherently more expensive) because it will ware down easily. see my man dez - old school dude who knows his stuff, is pretty entertaining (perhaps unintentionally) and was super patient while i deliberated over 5 different suits. tom knocked off the tag price for a sale i didn't even know about and out of goodwill gave me a discount on tailoring because i'm a student. solid mom and pop shop altogether and no obnoxious upselling or pandering. tell them your price range when you walk through the door and they'll totally work with you."
4-star,1,"i'm sure glad i read the reviews for tom's place after i had already made my purchase - i feel like some of the negative feedback might have scared me off of the place entirely. that being said, i'd received enough personal recommendations from both family and friends that i made the trek into kensington last week to look for a suit, three days before a wedding. now i don't pretend to know everything, or really anything, about suits. i know roughly what's in style and what is out of style. slim cut, in, box cut, out, thin over wide lapels, and so on. for the purists who've slammed tom's place, sure, maybe this isn't the best place for you, but, for someone like me who needs a decent suit that will last me a while (to help me look my best the half a dozen times i wear a suit in a year), on a budget, tom's place is a great find. are the suits last years style? sure, but we hold onto suits for way longer once we've purchased one, so what's a year or two if it saves you some serious bucks. for those that feel the story is cramped, well when are you visiting? i went during the week and there was next to no one other than staff on hand, and i felt i had plenty of room to move around. my suit was retail close to $800, tom's had it marked at $450. now i don't pretend that i don't know that tom's likely got this suit for pennies on the dollar, and was why they, without asking, knocked another $100 off the price. do i care? not really, the suit is great, fit perfectly the moment i put it on and, well... $350?!! i got the suit on the main floor and my store associate, a woman whose name i don't recall, was very helpful and scoured the racks with me to find a few good options. we then went upstairs where one of the gentlemen there showed me some different shirt/tie/pocket square combos to put together to change the look of my black suit. every item i ended up purchasing came with an automatic discount, i didn't really need to ask, so i assume it's just standard operating procedure for them to knock some bucks off. made me wonder if i could have asked for more. at the end of the day i walked out of there with a full outfit for under $700 (including alterations). a real plus for me was despite their 7-10 day alteration turnaround time that they normally request, they went the extra mile for me and had it done in 48 hours (pants taken up and lapels needed to be repressed and flattened out). when i came to try them on, it was margaret at the front who walked over, pulled up my jacked and said ""something on these pants doesn't look right, take them off and i'll have the tailor redo them"". this for me was a big plus and a sign of good old fashioned customer service - thank you! my only critique was the woman who answered the phone when i phone in (as instructed) to check on the status of my alterations. she was extremely short and snippy on the phone and cut me off mid-question telling me they'd call me back when they knew more. it wasn't a big deal, but a more sensitive customer might take offense to the particular tone and approach she took. as i mentioned, save for the one minor blemish, my experience was hassle and pressure free and i got a good suit at a great price. best of all, my lady told me i looked great when i suited up, and isn't that the most important point. thanks tom's place, i'll be back for a grey and blue suit when the time comes :)"
1-star,0,"they will rip you off! i bought a jacket in which the guy told me it was $450.00 - thinking i'm a good barterer i got them down to $300.00. afterwards i took it to a guy who used to be in a similar business where he told me they ripped me off - there were no prices on the jacket, no labels as to what the jacket is made of etc. except that it was made for tom's place. they will supposedly call tom to see if he will go down to a better price but i doubt anyone was on the other end. you can do much better at so many other places in toronto but if you do go please do so with your eyes wide open and do not buy anything that does't already have a price on it. i will never go back. so disapointed in myself for falling for this scam."
5-star,1,went there to buy a suit...sasha the sales person was very patient and helpful..bout 2 suits instead of 1. would definetely go in again only because of sasha.
5-star,1,"these guys really helped me. they're staff was equipped with knowledge; they were willing to share and advise it as well. i had no knowledge of suits and i left completely satisfied with one, the product, and two, their service. i'd recommend it for anyone looking at their first suit. i'd also recommend it for anyone looking in the $1000+ price range. they have suits ranging from $150-$1500+."
4-star,1,"it is important to know exactly what you want before going to tom's place. the typical person will be overwhelmed by the selection. a common trend with the salespeople here is that they will get you to try out all sorts of different stuff that you originally did not have in mind. that is perfectly okay, given that you try it on for size, but keep reiterating to the sales associate (sa) what you had in mind originally! demonstrate that you know exactly what to purchase. if you do this, they will yield and be very helpful. i was chatting with a gentleman about the construction of suits and their respective prices - he was 100% accurate and there was no bs. edit: now that i think about it, he was buttering up his story a bit. be careful when they ""flaunt"" how great some of the brands are, because the only one for me that's worth purchasing at the store is ""corneliani"", but they are upwards of $1300. he also gave insightful pieces of advice and life stories that i enjoyed. contrary to other reviews, my sa didn't exactly pressure me. when i was contemplating to purchase a certain suit (it was beautiful to be honest), another salesman came over and had a chat. ended the conversation saying i should buy because it is a great deal. normally, i'd label it as a pressure tactic, but in all honesty, even without his persuasion, i would have purchased because the deal was just too insanely good to pass on. not going to share the specifics, but the suit i scored costs much more at harry rosen. tom is the man! beware: if they find out you have a good taste in fashion (aka expensive), they'll show you all sorts of (seemingly) good stuff to entice you - bring a (guy that really knows their stuff about suits) friend with you to the store if you're a ""noob"". self-control is paramount. do your research first!"
1-star,0,"the worst retail experience of my life. 1/5 of stars? they deserve -5/5! highlights of my experience: -high pressure salespeople - 5 people will swarm you to try to convince you on something; whether it be that something looks ""beautiful"" on you or their alterations were done properly. -very poor fashion sense. these people are not connected with modern day styles and are fit to serve 60 year olds and above. i guess it's my fault to giving them a chance (i am 29 years old) -they made me buy three suits with pants that did not fit, promising they would special order me new pants. once i came back to order the pants, they could only do it with 1 out of the 3 pairs. -alterations were poorly done. they refuse to consider what i wanted and made fun of my style. this coming from a lady who wore such wide legged pants, you couldn't even see her shoes. it's 2014!!! wow...i ended up taking everything elsewhere to do it properly. they deliberately left one pair of pants untouched because i was being ""picky"" -tom is a typical lying salesman. i don't understand how he's weaseled his way into so many years of service. don't trust a word he says. also, buddy, there are more adjectives that is a ""beautiful"" suit on you. -i told him about a guy who helped me at the halton hills location. he was really good and his style suited mine. the staff all made fun of his sense of style and said he didnt know what he was doing. they were putting down their own employee when i said he was part of a positive experience of mine. -tom shook my hand and told me not to come back to the store. hah, i wouldn't even come back if i was offered 10 free suits. i hope to spread the word so they get the message. you need customer service training for heavens sake!!!"
1-star,0,"the sales staff are all trained in 30 year old psychology tricks to make you think you're getting a good deal and make you feel more invested in the process than you actually are. i wouldn't call them pushy (and they seem to vary widely) but some of them are downright rude. for a place that boasts 10'000 suits they present preciously few actual options on top of which, everything takes forever to fetch. they do have a large selection and they do seem to have a lot at lower price points so maybe if you're on a tight budget you'd fare better here than elsewhere. but if you're looking to get a good suit you can almost certainly do better with a department store and a good tailor or one of the cheaper made-to-order places."
3-star,0,"i think my story is similar to a few here: naive clothing buyer, new to toronto, on a budget but needing work clothes. i don't recall the experience being all that bad. the sales guy i worked with was nice enough--not really pushy. in fact, he was pretty honest about the fact that they just did not have my size. the store does feel a little cluttered--this is certainly not rosen's! i forget what i ended up with but it was only a few garments. the pants needed to be altered and some mistake was made with the one pair i still have. they were nice strellson's--the pair of slacks i now wear when i can't wear jeans to something but the weather is crap. i am unsure how good the deals are. you won't overpay here but i don't know if you are getting any kind of serious bargain. it seems like they work on buying a lot of last season's items and passing on the discount to you. i would not go to this store for a suit. well, i would maybe come here before moore's or tip top. but would i ever return for anything? maybe. if i was in the area, and there was a particular thing i was looking for, such as a black sweater, i might pop in. otherwise, it is kind of an experience, much like honest ed's, that everyone in toronto should try once. a comment on those ""5 suites for $x"" and similar deals. men, please don't go for this. don't repeat my costly mistakes. look, anything that is being advertised based on price is just not going to be high quality. items of very high quality are rarely ever on any kind of serious sale. and a suit needs to be high quality. the first reason for ever buying certain items should never be ""because i got a good price."" a suit is high up there on the list. chances are that a hiring manager, people you want to date and your clients are going to be able to spot a cheap suit. you don't want to be that guy in the cheap suit. besides, does anyone other than politicians and bay street boys really need 5 suits? do yourself a big favour. save up some money ($1,500 is a good start) and get a properly made bespoke or mtm suit. navy blue or charcoal grey. goes with everything. next suit can be the other colour if you find you need more than one. very few of us really do. take time, build your wardrobe carefully and thoughtfully. a well made suit will last a long time--clothes shouldn't be bought and worn as disposable items."
5-star,1,"i've been going to tom's place for almost 6 years now, and never had a bad experience. went there today and it was just as i expected. was immediately greeted by patrick duncan (he has helped me in the past), told him what i wanted, and within 10 minutes i was paying. tom was very helpful on the price, and threw in a suit bag and a pair of funky socks. turns out it was duncan's wife's birthday, and he was still at work. i hope he takes her out for a nice dinner. if you are looking for a good suit, at a good price i can't recommend a better place."
5-star,1,"hey i read some of the other posts below but i had to check this out for myself. i'm originally from ny's lower east side and had never been to kensington market till last weekend. i had told my brother n law that i wanted a new sports jacket and couldn't find anything that i liked in moores. he told me to checkout toms. i walked in and immediately felt like i was back at home on orchard st. a huge selection in a somewhat cramped space. the staff were super friendly. the s.p. introduced himself and asked my name. being in sales for years myself this impressed me. i immediately found more then 4 items that i liked, and ended up buying 2 and feel i got a good deal. i thoroughly enjoyed my experience there and highly recommend that you check it out for yourself. hey ask for lawrence he was a top notch nice guy to deal with."
5-star,1,"pay attention to this post. tom's place in kensington market is the last suit store you will ever need to go to for quality suits at a great price. open since 1958, originally by tom's father, it has the largest selection of suits probably in the world. from great canadian made high quality styles to fine italian suits found on the 2nd floor, you will find what you are looking for. not only will you get the suit and accessories you needed at the best price possible, but the full experience of buying a suit, being treated like a star. in addition, tom's place has a good number of on site tailors for your convenience and theirs, making the time it takes to have your suit ready minimal. oh, and women, yes...tom's has a good selection of suits for you also. the best thing for you to do is come down and visit the shop and see it for yourself. let them know you saw them on gems and you might get a better deal - ask for tom specifically on this one. ok...we'll see you tomorrow! what's next?"
1-star,0,"honestly, i don't know much about suits. the salespeople seemed to want to hurry me away so they can meet their next customer. they would say certain things and watch me inspect my own purchase that made me feel hurried and thus uncomfortable. the tailor is terrible! not recommended to anyone! get your alterations done elsewhere! here is what was wrong with my suit (everything below was found after the alterations were done): 1. chalk marks still visible on the outside of the suit jacket 2. suit jacket not ironed out so it was wrinkly 3. the jacket's back right bottom flap and back left bottom flap around my ass area were not level which made one side 4mm higher than the other side when viewed from the back 4. suit jacket was not flat against my body where the centre chest piece meets the arm piece at the shoulder which made the shoulder areas stick out in the front and back 5. when you flip your pants upside down and inspect the crotch area, the four lines should come together to look like two lines (like a cross or ""x""). mine was three lines because two of the lines did not align properly 6. right pant leg was 5mm longer than the left pant leg. turns out the bottom of my left pant leg was folded straight, but the right pant leg was folded curved and improperly (one end of the fold was level with the other leg, but not the other end) 7. when the pants are worn, the pants should be fairly straight with a slight bend. somehow, the salesperson (unintentionally or intentionally) missed the bunching up of excess fabric near my shoe (like when you wear pants way too long and the fabric falls down onto your shoe). but i think this may also have been because the pants were too tight or is the style 8. vests are supposed to fit tight against the body (from my online research) but mine still had a lot of fabric in the breast and shoulder blade area that could have been taken out i know i nitpicked every single tiny detail and was looking for perfection, but here's why: i shelled out $600 for a fine italian suit. but, really, some of my findings just tell me the tailor doesn't really know what he's doing and didn't do a thorough and complete job. p.s. if you drive here, park in the multi-level parking garage on baldwin and present your parking ticket to the person at the front counter for a rebate. p.s.s. as a seriously dissatisfied customer, if any of you are truly skeptical of my review, drop me a message and i'll take photos of my strellson suit for you."
1-star,0,"horrible customer service!!! i actually had a staff member snatch a shirt out of my hands i was going to try on, after i had already bought a bunch of things. i can understand wanting to have staff around to try things on, but instead of acting professional and explaining that, this guy got in my face and rudely pointed out this wasn't walmart (i was with someone else as well) and yanked the shirt right out of my hands. it was the single worst customer service i have every experienced."
2-star,0,"while the idea of tom's place is very appealing the execution leaves much to be desired. let's break it down into functional chunks: location: great! right in the heart of kensington market - convenient to ttc and lots of parking nearby. ambiance: one has to imagine that the canned sardines of allegorical fame have more room to move around than either the suits or customers in this ""before"" poster for fire marshall training. it is c-r-o-w-d-e-d in here! add some bad lighting and you get an interior shot of tom's place when you look up ""ramshackle"" in the on-line dictionary, staff: sigh. pret-ty, pret-ty bad. pretty much caricatures of pushy salesmen. the suits: a mixed bag. mostly ""moores"" level of quality, a fair bit of mid-level dept. store stuff (canadian made!), a sprinkling of higher end material (from last season) and, of course, some pure crap. the ""deal"": the x for 1 deal is a nice marketing ploy, but bears little semblance to actual street prices. their goal is to sell at least 5 suits per customer and the suits are arranged so that you are pretty much compelled to select a couple of better, a couple of mid, and one or two pieces of junk. the ""deal"" prices tend to magically average out to $300 to $350 per suit. always. you will invariably include one ""why the hell did i buy that?"" suit in your deal, so use that to figure your average price. the verdict: meh. you can do better in montreal and still get current season product or just drive down to buffalo and save another 20-30%. if you have an empty suit closet (just starting out. weight gain/loss) you may pick up a reasonable package, but don't expect to be overwhelmed by the price quality access."
1-star,0,"i was recently part of a wedding party whose groom decided that we would be buying our suits from tom's. i have always been told that it woul d be a good place for me to check out good designer suits and so on and so forth, so i was pretty excited. as the end goal was matching suits, we were reasonably expected to reserve our jacket size; fair enough. when the day came to go get measured for alterations, a friend of mine was told that they did not have his size and he would have to wear two sizes smaller or he ""could always just lose some weight"". he's a big guy and kind of oddly proportioned, so while still pretty dickish, i could kind of understand that he'd be a difficult fit. me, on the other hand, was forced to wear two-sizes up from a 38, and their solution was to make us pay for a ton of alterations, which still ended up looking far too big. suit + alterations probably cost around $450-500 (i'm not sure how much the alterations cost, but considering they pretty much disassembled and reassembled the suit, i'm sure it was over $100). for that price, i could have gotten a made-to-measure suit from one of the many online tailors (brooklyn tailors, modasuite, etc) and have it fit like a glove. hell, i've bought suits from h&m and mexx that fit better than this suit after alterations, for less than half the cost! this place thrives on people who want to feel they've gotten a bargain for a brand name, instead of spending money on a proper-fitting suit that was made properly for their bodies."
1-star,0,"one of my best friends is getting married, and instead of having us all in tuxedos, he optioned for slightly more stylish suits. finding matching suits for three groomsmen and a best man who are all different sizes is tricky, so we went to tom's because we knew we could get a deal on the suits, and they'd probably have a few that matched. we were lucky, we got four of the same, and at a decent deal; about $180 a suit before alterations. these aren't incredible suits, but they look decent enough and the price was unbeatable. we all needed alterations. we got marked up and left the suits with them for a month and a half. last week we picked up the suits, and in our hurry to get to the bachelor party that night didn't check the alterations very closely. it wasn't until tonight that two of us tried our suits on again and realized that literally nothing had been done to them in the way of alterations. my pants are still covered in chalk marks, the shoulders are still an inch too broad on either side, and the waist could fit two of me. were we stupid to wait so long? absolutely. should we have stuck up to the salesman who swindled us into buying suits that were too big? definitely. but he told us he could fix it all with alterations, and we're young and gullible. bottom line, don't waste your time here. the quality of the suits are mostly rubbish, the salesmen are pushy, and don't care what fits as long as they make the sale, and the alterations didn't happen. at all. after a month and a half. we'll be taking the suits back tomorrow and asking for our money back on the alterations. we'll have to take them to a tailor in the city to fix their bullshit."
2-star,0,"tom's place in kensington market is an institution: i suspect that every young bay streeter has paid mr. mihalek a visit, or attended one of his 'warehouse' sales at the miles nadal jcc or elsewhere on bathurst. the place is a maze, with sales help hiding around corners and ready to help you navigate the racks. while the layout invites browsing the sales pitch can be aggressive and also focuses on the house brand rather than designer 'finds'. a fair chunk of the latter may be seconds or dead stock, but since it all just piles up like an episode of ""hoarders"", tom's could actually double as one of the better vintage shops in the market. much has been written about tom's willingness to haggle, and it's true, but watch the sticker pricing on suits, shirts and ties. for widely available brands and can easily buy off the rack, you might do better at a department store sale. still, tom's is good theater, and a vital part of a neighborhood built on thrift. more importantly, customers leave happy, convinced they've scored a serious bargain."
4-star,1,"i find this european chain to be equivalent to a zara maybe? the clothing is a much better quality than, say, forever 21 and fairly trendy. i was first introduced to the brand in london and always make a point to visit if it's located in a city i am visiting. this location is large as it houses both womens and a mens side (topman)! they have clothing, a nice sized shoe dept as well as accessories and makeup. their prices are fairly affordable especially if you shop the sales and clearance. i scored a cute wallet, classic purse (yay for no obnoxious logo) and some makeup for less than $50 - all on sale . beware of some items being final sale so make sure you're committed to your purchases. there are no heavily pushy sales associates here. i saw some random folks on the sales floor but they were doing merchandising. overall, very pleasant shopping experience. i would go back if in the area."

4-star,1,"this is my favorite topshop that i have been to so far. i've been to topshop at nordstrom and the big one in chicago and none of them compare to this one. i'm not sure if it's because they are located in las vegas aka they have better style clothes shipped here for this store, but it's a better selection here than other places. this location is always so clean and the customer service is great. they also have a private shopping dressing room which consists of a couple of spacious dressing rooms and a private check out area. i also love that they have a huge selection of petite size clothes! i couldn't give this place 5 stars though, only because i think majority of the items here are overpriced!"
1-star,0,"went into topshop today to return an outfit and i was told by sara ""the manager"" that my clothes were too worn. she arrived to the counter in a horrible mood and didn't even greet me with a hello or how are you or even introduce herself as the manager. i worn them for maybe an hour and they were still in perfect condition. she then told me the extra buttons are missing but i don't know anyone that keeps the extra buttons on their outfits while they wear them. just the week before i spent $500 on clothes there and i just needed to return one outfit but she said that she sees clothes everyday and mine are ""wrinkly"" so u can't return them for me because they have a few wrinkles she said yes and that's it. she was so disrespectful and very demeaning. i said then maybe i'll try to go to a different topshop facility so i can talk to someone with better customer service skills and she said good luck because i'm the manager and were the only topshop in vegas. this is apparently the only topshop in vegas so needless to say i won't be shopping there anymore. sincerely, a used to be a loyal guest!"
2-star,0,"nice selection, good prices, horrible service. i found an item, ready to buy, but nobody helped me for 20 mins. finally, i had to hunt one of them down, and he guided me to the fitting room and then ran away. i stood there... wanted a different size, but nobody would help me. so i walked out."
4-star,1,"this is one of my favorite places to shop. their jeans are truly amazing (for my body type) they carry some unique stuff. i don't see why someone would call this an over priced urban outfitters, the prices are not much different and the clothes at top shop are much more trendy. what i'm really impressed with at this particular store is the amazing customer service. thank you to the staff for being so helpful when needed and not hovering over you every second when not needed."
5-star,1,"at stores like topshop, you're partially paying higher prices for the unique clothing, and partially paying for a fabulous employee to put together a great outfit for you. i rushed in ten minutes before closing, needing an outfit because all my luggage had been lost. the employees (despite being almost done for the day) pulled my sizes in dresses and shoes, grabbed accessories and purses, and soon made an outfit much cuter than anything i had lost in my luggage. a huge thank you to topshop- while the clothing is fabulous, great employees are what make shopping fun. i'll be back next time i'm in vegas... and the time after that.. and the time after that!"
3-star,0,"to me, this was a higher-priced h & m store. i looked at the clearance racks, grouped according to size (smaller sizing, btw), in the front, and i started to lose interest because the sale prices i thought were a little on the high side (trying to stick to my new rule of only buying items that i truly love, which means it will get used more often). in this mall, i'd rather shop at the following: ann taylor loft, the limited, forever 21 or cotton on. i don't understand the buzz."
4-star,1,so i gave it another try last weekend. i am please to say they are becoming more and more like the one i see in london! i'm excited! the shoe selection was to die for! i love it now and will probably go back there next time. i wish they had more purses though!
2-star,0,eh its ok. that was my thought going through the store the entire time. it just reminds me of a pricey h&m/forever 21. now being my favorite store is free people i'm used to spending 100-150$ for a shirt but i couldn't really find anything here that was worth that. i'm very particular about the pieces i chose for my wardrobe that being said i don't think ill be returning here anytime soon. i mean $75 for leggings? a little ridiculous if you ask me.
2-star,0,"this store is a bit pricey . your $$ goes further at h&m and forever 21. for the price, zara fits the value better. also, i didn't realize many of their garments can't go to dryer.....until it's too late."
3-star,0,"this new store is located in fashion show mall on the las vegas strip. i stopped by to browse and i found a cute necklace that i purchased for $3! so, 5 stars for the $3 find and the friendly service at the cash register. everything else grossly overpriced for the quality not sure what the hype is about this place. if you want to spend money on cool clothes go to zara's!"
1-star,0,"overrated..... why come here when you can get the exact same thing at h&m or forever 21 for literally 1/2 the cost. the people behind the counter are rude, too. i don't wanna give my money to a place that sells hipster clothes that only homeless people would wear."
5-star,1,took my wife here since she wanted to check out what all the hype was all about... i was surprised at how many options they had available. they even serve chilled drinks while your significant other shops. i personally didn't find anything but then again i wasn't really looking at the clothes at least hahaha.
5-star,1,"finally i made it topman after browsing their website for awhile since i didn't really have the time to head to new york or london. well my expectations were filled but i wasn't overly impressed. prices are pretty average for the merchandise as this is not h&m nor is it considered high-end. from full suits to basic tees and undergarments the selection for men was decent. customer service was average as i browsed and offered help here and there. the guys in the men's shoes and fitting rooms were exceptionally helpful. i had to try on like 15 shirts and tees and like 4 jeans so the fitting room associate was extremely patient and help to organize my looks. next, i happen to hit topman when the summer stuff was on sale so much of the merchandise was extremely discounted. for example, so much of the necklaces were only $2 or $4 down from $25-$40! there's no topman in colorado or much of america so i think your purchases will be pretty unique. overall it was a great time and i cam away with my student discount of 10% (bring your student id) on top of the end-of-summer sale."
2-star,0,"when you walk in, the music makes it feel like you've entered a club. the wife spent about an hour looking at the clothes, but as for the men's selection, too tight, and too small. maybe it's just not my style."
2-star,0,"they have a photo booth! :)) what a great souvenir. besides that, this is definitely a start. nothing can compare to the location in london, but its a good start. they have a nice store front display, and its in a decent location. the shoe section is okay, but they do have a good selection with the space they have. maybe its because i'm no expert when it comes to money exchange, but why are the prices for clothing more than double here in america? we looked up the exchange rate and it wasn't making sense.... until they can figure out a better way of pricing their items, i'm still going to be loyal to forever. i love topshop, but i need to understand how they are trying to price things. i did ask someone working there to explain it to me, but she had no idea. all in all, yes, stop by this store, take some photos in their booth, and have a look around. the woman helping us was friendly...she was in the shoe department, no one else asked us if we needed help so i can't vouch for them. this was a really fun place to look around."
5-star,1,"i've been shopping at the topshop online store for years, this was my first time going to the store. we came here on sunday before going back to la. its located in the fashion show mall. the store is massive. it has such a lovely selection and fun atmosphere. lm 5'0 tall and under 85lbs and they had a petite section! probably my favorite part.. they also had a huge selection of accessories. loved the socks and necklaces. the shoe section is also a good size. some of the shoes were on sale for the holiday weekend. i was treated so well by the employees. they were all extremely helpful and friendly. i had a personal shopping suite and my own stylist ginger who was such a doll. i think she is also the manager. she walked up to me numerous times while i shopped and took my items. i ended up spending about 2 hours at topshop and walked away with tons of great finds. i now know every time i go to vegas i'll set a few hours aside to shop here. next time i go i'll call/email ginger to pull clothes in my size. my overall experience here was amazing."
5-star,1,"i died and went to retail heaven. i am obsessed with the website and i was so happy to finally walk through an actual store! whether you've heard of it or not, if you love fashion you will love topshop.... guaranteed. and that's all you really need to know."
4-star,1,"great store with tons of great pieces and basics. this is the uniqlo/gap/h&m of london. much of the stuff is expensive for what it is, but you can find a good deal. they have some great shoes and dresses for reasonable prices. the jewelry section is amazing and i was so tempted to buy a bunch of stuff. i also like that they have a 10% discount for students, woo. i bought a cute polka dot dress (somewhat retro), some cute flats, and socks. some of the loafers they have are cute and all leather but pricey for what i was looking for... $65 for cheap loafers... decided to spend that on my dress! and the dress is machine washable! sizing is a little odd... i'm usually a 0 or 2, and a 4 in my dress fit me ok. the 2 was too tight. odd. definitely need to try before you buy here. the dressing rooms are spacious and nice. they're a bit understaffed though. all the clothes are on trend and will be standout pieces in your wardrobe... this is more than i can say for uniqlo/gap who specialize in the basics. definitely worth a stop to shop. after i purchased my goods and walked around to other stores and other malls, people actually stopped me to ask me about topshop. i guess it's pretty popular since it's so new in vegas."
3-star,0,"admission: i love bargains! for most items, i feel that unless the clothes are being made in italy, you are ending up with the same quality, so why pay an arm and leg to cover your arm and legs? if i am going to spend a pretty penny, i want to go big or understand the value. the shopping experience and selection at topshop is fun and stylish if you enjoy uk chic, but i found myself circling like a vulture and simply spying on price tags. everything was about 2 to 3 times more than i anticipated, so i decided to leave without a shiny new item this time. for example, some tom-inspired shoes displayed on plastic hangers (not in boxes) were around $50. here is a case where i'd rather get the toms for a little more and do a little good in the process. i will probably head back to see if there are sales that make some of their items look more ""must have"" when discounted."
4-star,1,"so i finally got to visit topshop/topman and i must say i'm loving the pieces they have. very up to date and fashionable. for all you fashionistas out there this is a great place to shop. i liked a lot of their clothes but i'm more on the heavy set so i really don't know if their stuff would fit me, looks kind of snug. one thing that caught my eye was all the cool accessories they had. some employees were helpful&friendly others just stood there, i must say, there are a lot of cute girls that work there lol. so to sum it all up it's a very fashionable store in the fashion show mall on the strip with tons of space and a lot of dope pieces to choose from, kind of pricey but dope none the less."
4-star,1,"so i just survived the grand opening of topshop here in las vegas yesterday and overall it was a great experience. the preopening ceremonies were kinda cool. i got to see steve wynn and kristen bell. they also had a fashion show and some free goodies. they gave away tote bags and gift cards. i got a wristband to be one of the first ones inside. inside they had a photo booth, hair and makeup makeovers, and gift with purchases. most the workers were very nice and attentive. they had a little trouble checking me out at the till but that was okay since i was probably her first customer. although they are a little pricey i love their stuff. i had to take away one star because of the very rude worker that was handing out gift bags to the crowd. he purposely passed by me multiple times saying that he had to ""spread them out"". he handed them to all the non asians around us. who already had multiple bags. he would be handing the bag in my direction, look at me, and then pause and pass it back. like one or two times that's okay maybe he did need to ""spread them out"" but three or four times, really now. overall i really do love their store. they also brought in people from the uk to help manage i guess. their accents and being in topshop really made me reminisce about my summer in cambridge."
5-star,1,this bike store was recommended to me by a friend and we got great bikes for both the kids. angie was super to work with and went over and beyond. awesome choice & great customer service.
5-star,1,this store was recommended since i needed a bike that would not only fit my needs but also fit me. i need a bike for exercise due to some knee and back issues. met with kenny and he was knowledgeable about which bike would be best for me. i added additional items to the purchase. this is a much better experience than the previous bike store i had visited. my bike will be built and ready in about a week. i'll add to this review once i've received the bike. but so far so good.....update...went back to the store to pick up my bike a week later and couldn't ask for better customer service. 100 % satisfied with the trek store.
5-star,1,"i would like to commend trek of south charlotte for the great customerservice.those guys are friendly, they know what they're doing and they really rock it! thanks so much for all the help!"
5-star,1,"i've been riding bikes for 20 years. this is the best experience i've ever had. yes, they fixed the mechanical issue i identified at good price. but they found some issues i had no idea about. the found them, called the manufacturers of the substandard parts and got them replaced. in the end they treated my bike like it was their own. i got literally 10x back in value that i paid for the original issue. this is my, hands down, one stop, go to, trusted bike source forever."
5-star,1,matt rossman was very helpful and professional. he helped my buddy get his bike back into shape so he could have transportation to work. my buddy was in a financial bind and he put together some budget friendly options to take care of the most pressing needs. will totally come back because of matt's service and expertise.
5-star,1,if you need a bicycle mechanic ask for francisco. francisco used to be a try sports in south park and i'm glad to announce he is now at the trek store near ballantyne. it makes it a lot easier to get in my bicycle equipment so we can fix it with his top notch skills. francisco has skills mad bicycle skills.
5-star,1,"went to shop for a new bike after about 12 or 13 years on my old one. i had done a lot of online research and even visited bike shops while out of town of many different makes and models. the team at this store showed me some options and offered a competitive price on a 2015 model stache 8. they adjusted the fork settings and air, installed my pedals, set the tire pressure and gave the bike a once over before i put in on my bike rack and went directly over to the whitewater center to ride. it felt as good as i had hoped it would. thanks everybody, you all were helpful and your guidance has provided me with a bike that i really enjoy!"
5-star,1,"i bought a cheap bike from a chain store being my first bike and all. i really like the bike but the bike tire kept busting for no apparent reason. the chain store just kept replacing it with the same tube and the problem kept occurring. took it here frustrated, just wanting to ride without a tire blowing, and they replaced it with the correct tube and explained why it kept happening. has been good so far for several rides. was in and out in 10 minutes and was quite cheaper than i expected. very helpful!"
5-star,1,"can't say enough good things about this place! after buying a bike from a surplus warehouse and spending far more than the 45 minutes estimated to connect the brakes i brought my bike here. off the bat they charged less than half of the advertised $40 on their website when i dropped it off. when i picked it up they had set up the brakes, inflated the tires and straightened the front tire (that may have been bent while i was wrestling with the brake system earlier) all free of charge. really nice guys! i will definitely be bringing my bike here for all future anticipated problems!"
5-star,1,"i do not have a lot of disposable income and bicycling can quickly become a very expensive endeavor. that said, i stopped by the this location because it's the only bike shop on my commute to work. i ride an old schwinn traveler from the 80's so i wasn't hopeful that they would be able to help me let alone be willing. however, they were amazing. a-ma-zing! they took the time to explain everything to me didn't overcharge for what turned out to be a simple fix. they charge $7.50 to put a new tire on and although this is something i could do myself, i'm going to have them do it for me because they earned my business. great place. management if you're reading this, i don't know his name, but the tech behind the counter on the morning of 7/22/14 needs a raise. he's awesome!"
5-star,1,"all of the staff we spoke to today we're helpful and are very knowledgable. ang was awesome! no-pressure to buy. lots of conversation about the type of riding we were planning to do and physical issues we were being mindful of (lumbar/lower vertebrae issues). prices are on-par for the types of bikes they carry. there are plenty of accessories (helmets, bells, shorts, water bottles, etc.). the parking lot is a great area to test out the bikes and see what works best for you or your little ones (yes, they have kids bikes). (update: 1 week later) my husband has been loving his bike! my bike, however, was supposed to be in from the california warehouse on thurs. ang was great and called to tell me that not only was my bike not in, but they had no info on when it would be in. she offered to put me on a woman's model if i wanted to ride sooner rather than later, but i opted to wait for my bike. as irked as i am of not having my bike, i really appreciated the call and the fact that there was no bullshitting or beating around the bush."
5-star,1,"from the moment you enter trend custom tailors, it becomes apparent that don lee is an artist. the ever-evolving decor highlights much of his artistic brilliance and creativity. i must point out that this is not an alteration service where one brings their pants to be taken up an inch. this is a true bespoke tailor shop where you will receive a personalized consultation with the tailor who will be cutting the cloth you choose, hanging your sleeves, and fitting you in your new suit at the end. the shop features glass work that the proprietor has had commissioned from students in the arts at ryerson - one way in which he contributes back to the community, custom made iron work around the windows from local craftsmen and women, not to mention his own paintings, sculptures, and murals that demonstrate his varied artistic talents and usually incorporate a captivating blend of contrast and texture regardless of the medium. don's passion for art and eye for fashion is carried into every garment that he makes. i have trusted don to choose materials and patterns for me in a very consultative manner, giving him free artistic licence on the finished product, and i have never been let down. i love the way i feel in my suits from trend. they fit perfectly. it is also nice to get frequent compliments on my shirts and suits. i'm often asked where i bought my shirts and suits, which is a great compliment to trend's finished product. i'm pretty shocked to have come across such polarized opinions of this business on yelp. what does not shock me is that both negative reviewers share something in common: a total of one review each on yelp. i would disregard them. if you're looking for a fantastic bespoke suit, my advice is that you make an appointment with trend and go see for yourself what all the hype is about. you will not be disappointed."
5-star,1,"don is making a suit for my upcoming wedding in may and the experience so far has been nothing but extremely wonderful and pleasant! don is simply amazing - he is an artist and his pieces just speak for themselves. if i could give him 10-stars i would! don's team is also simply wonderful. from the moment you walk in they welcome you and make you feel at home. their attention to detail and professionalism is amazing. i highly recommend don when you're out looking to get a suit made - it is definitely well worth it and i will definitely be back again for more clothing! btw - i am a woman and he specializes not only in men's wear but in women's suits as well. he is rare gem in toronto and ladies the suits are amazing! he is also in the process of remodelling a floor in his new location just for ladies! so please if you're looking for your next suit, consider don! you won't be disappointed!"
5-star,1,"don is a talented, polite and hard-working man. he has a great team. their sense of fashion and professionalism are unparalleled. i wish i could buy all my clothes from don."
1-star,0,im going to keep this short and civil. my experience at trend was not as pleasant as the previous review. i find the services were subpar and the proprietors conduct was unprofessional. not recommended.
5-star,1,"here i go again writing a review that will probably come back to bite me. trend custom tailors is one of those rare finds you only tell your good friends about because you don't want the secret to get out and the place get too busy, but we're all friends at yelp so why not. if there were 10 stars, i would hands down give don (don fabien lee, the owner) a full ten stars. his level of professionalism, artistry, and fashion knowhow is unmatched. all his work is tailored to your unique style, from completely conservative to the most daring of looks, but what don does exceptionally is take conventional formal attire and fuse it with a modern, trendy flare, call it contemporary with an edge. and it so happens that style fits my taste. you can expect friendly personal attention, impeccable work, and the highest quality clothing you've ever owned, without the stuffy atmosphere and outrageous price tags. i'm not saying it's cheap but you can get a bespoke suit of better quality for comparable or lower price than the european off-the-rack suits at a harry or holts. nothing i write will really do it justice; you can only understand what i mean once you put on that first suit don makes for you. you will never go back. in fact i no longer have any use for harry, holt, or any of the other stores where you're supposed to buy your quality work / formal attire. i don't plan on buying a suit, jacket, shirt, or pants off the rack ever again."
5-star,1,"extremely helpful, friendly staff, great reasonable prices, and varied selection. by far my favorite shop in town, i go here for all my tennis needs!"
5-star,1,family owned and operated. tamara and karl are wonderful and so helpful with all of my tennis needs. tucker's tennis has provided our team uniforms every season since they've opened. they carry the hottest new trends that makes our team stand out amongst the crowd. thanks tamara and karl for all that you do.
5-star,1,"found this shop via yelp, and what a great little shop. so friendly from the first phone call, to getting our rackets strung. and now that my son is taking tennis a little more seriously, we need to start shopping for a better racket. they have an amazing demo program where you can demo a racket for a week for only $10. the $10 is then applied towards the purchase price of a new racket. what a great way to try out different rackets, and find the perfect one. you just can't beat that deal. they're also very knowledgeable, which is very appreciated when you've been out of the tennis scene as long as i have. =)"
5-star,1,"i have had several good experiences here, and i can honestly say i have had more great buying experiences here then i can count. i have worked in the tennis industry for over 16 years. i have managed and owned tennis retail shops of my own in the past in various locations in the u.s. so i don't frequently see many places that i feel are exceptional... but....without hesitation.... i will say that tucker's tennis is the las vegas valley's only quintessential tennis pro shop. it is locally owned and owner operated by people who really care about tennis. more importantly though, tucker's and its ownership care about people and it shows. the store is small but packed with several different brands and options for rackets, shoes, and accessories. if they don't have it, they will find a way to procure it for you. and to top all of that off, they have competitive pricing. and for those reasons..... 5 stars."
5-star,1,ok tennis players if you're like me and you need a little help finding the perfect racquet this is the place.. it's awesome that they have such an easy demo program here. it's $10 per racquet and you get to use it for one week. i'm a 3.5-4.0 player and got alot of different suggestions and actually took their advice and tried one racquet that i wanted and another that they chose. i believe this will be my tennis store from now on. another great thing is your demo rental goes towards your purchase of your racquet. how can you beat that..yes you can go online and wait for the racquet to ship to you but i like instant gratification. sometimes having a shop in town that can cater to your needs right away is something i'd pay a little more for. thank you so much guys you were so kind and helpful. my racquet purchase is definite after this demo.
5-star,1,"came in, the owner helped me. i was out of the game for 15 years and times have changed. she showed me the latest rackets and even custom ordered some special rackets for my kids. they gave a loaner to try after the other owner and coach guided me in the right direction. i chose the pure drive and they strung it, next day ready! great service."
5-star,1,what a hidden gem. the owner was so nice and helpful with my daughter. great store for all your tennis needs! definitely recommend!
5-star,1,great store for knick knacks and the staff in the flower shop are world class. they were good enough to put together flowers for visiting royalty. i've had several sets of flowers ordered from a distance and everytime i got massive thanks from people who were really impressed.
1-star,0,"i had receive a beautiful arrangement from twigs so i decided to try them out when i needed to send flowers. i picked out a very nice arrangement and filled in all the required info online to have them sent out. on the day they were to be delivered i waited excitedly for them to arrive so i could see my friends face when she received them (we work together). by 2pm they hadn't arrived so i called and asked if they could give me an update on the delivery time. the woman said they went out at 11 and should have been there by now, maybe just wait a bit longer as the drivers deliver by quadrants if the city. that sounded normal but i did point out to her that we are located less than half a block away from the store. she couldn't give me anymore info just that they would be delivered before 4 (i had specified our business hours were 9-4). i said just because that is when we are open doesn't mean i want them to be delivered just before i close. who wants to get flowers 5 minutes before going home, you want to enjoy them all day long. she said she couldn't help me, i would just have to wait as it is a separate company that does the delivering. i waited until 3:30 and called back again, i got the same lady on the phone and she wasn't even trying to hide her annoyance with me this time. she said there is nothing she can do once they've gone out and they will be there before 4. the flowers arrived at 4:10, my friend had gone home (but did enjoy them when she came to work the next day) and i called to speak with the manager. i was told she was busy but sending her an email was a good option. i insisted on leaving my name and number and also emailed sheila (the manager) my issue. i didn't ask to have my money back for the arrangement, they were very nice. i was just asking to have the $13 delivery fee returned as the flowers were not delivered when they said they would be. i never received a response. because of their lack of service, i will not be shopping here ever again. if you're wondering why i would even bother having them delivered instead of walking across the street to pick them up to save myself the $13, it's because it's muh nicer having a surprise show up for you at work them someone walking in and dropping them in your desk. i know it sounds weird, but it's nicer. anyways, i now state my hours open for delivery are 9-12 so the other florists i use don't take it so literally that it is acceptable to deliver at closing time."
4-star,1,"i've popped into twigs & company a few times after having brunch downtown. i love this store. we walked in and were overwhelmed by the stunning easter display. it was like a wonderland of sort, so much to look at. we were told that the display is constantly changing, almost weekly. the best part of this store are the staff. they have always been so attentive and friendly. we popped upstairs to the ladies boutique and played 'dress up'. i wish i got the name of the gentleman who was looking after us because he made my day. we had a blast. it never fails; we always walk out of twigs & company with something special. i highly recommend this store for beautiful jewelry and decorative items for the home. a cooler of lovely flower arrangements is at the back of the store. truly a one-stop shop for everything that can make you feel special."
2-star,0,"i live in san francisco and wanted to use a local calgary florist (rather than the 1-800-flowers chain types) to send congratulatory flowers to a friend in calgary who just had a baby. i saw the arrangements on twigs and co.'s website and chose the summer special. it was beautiful in the photos, full of roses and other pretty flowers. i liked it so much, i even added 10 bucks more for the deluxe version. the picture i received of the actual arrangement that was delivered was totally different and much less impressive. i was totally disappointed that i spent 95 bucks on such a mediocre flower arrangement delivery. oh, speaking of delivery, they charge 13.95 for that without mentioning it. on the positive side, they did deliver when they said they would. i don't like leaving negative reviews, but i was really disappointed."
5-star,1,"what a cute store!!! thanks to yelp, i'm exploring businesses i wouldn't normally get the chance to explore, and this having been said, i stumbled into twigs just yesterday! it's a very eye catching store because there are huge windows in the front that look right into the store. the store is one of the most seasonal stores i've ever seen - what i mean is that during halloween, it's all halloween. and now, it's all christmas! when you walk in, you're overwhelmed with things, things, everywhere! you almost don't know where to look first! what a lot of people don't know is that while twigs carries all this stuff, they are also a floral shop! they have flowers for every occasion! gifts, decorations, flowers, oh my! it's definitely a one stop shop if you're on your way to someone's house for dinner and want to take along something beautiful and thoughtful. the next time i'm heading out for a soiree, i'll definitely make a pit stop at twigs and ensure i pick up the perfect gift for the host of the evening."
4-star,1,i'm a huge fan on the ua brand and all of their clothing. it holds up over time because of the quality and has a practical use. i find some good deals from the outlet when i go to the store and i like that can try it on there. i also order clothing online from the ua site and i'm able to return it to the outlet store if i don't like it which is nice.
1-star,0,"i love adidas better then ua enough said, nothing will beat the ultra boosts!!! under amors basket ball shoes are uncomfortable would never buy shoes by them again lesson learned."
5-star,1,"i'm a gym/exercise junkie and i appreciate high quality, affordable and comfortable athletic wear and shoes! under armour hits the mark every time! i can rest assured that if i'm looking for it, it will be at under armour! the staff is amazing too! helpful and knowledgeable and very professional!"
5-star,1,"the under armour outlet is a great store with many reasonably priced under armour clothing, shoes and accessories. most all of the items are 40% off or you can find items on clearance that have a lower marked down price plus 30%-40% off. you have to look for the best bargains but everything is discounted which makes this store awesome compared to paying full retail price for great quality items. highly recommend this store to anyone who loves under armour products."
5-star,1,it is rare to experience customer service at this level. the entire staff was friendly and willing to go that extra step to assist us. definitely. way to go under armour!!!!
1-star,0,"i held stocks with under armour and decided to sell based on this experience. i went on a friday for he end of season sale. i asked a rep for a specific shoe, she said she would come back, and i waited 15 minutes before someone new comes up and asks, ""how can i help you? the other girl is busy now."" wowzers. so they can't find my shoe color or size. i ask them to check the north premium outlet (looking for the curry's), the rep explains that he ""made the call for another customer and knows they are out of curry's"". interesting. i end up traveling to the north outlet because the experience was so poor-low and behold curry city! how is it that this outlet has reps who will not call to check inventory? how is this practice of laziness and lack of service tolerable? i was so taken back that i realized this is why the uaa stock is falling, piss poor location management."
5-star,1,"went to under armor this past weekend and wow what a joy people on the floor very helpful. then got to head to the check out with our boatload of shoes and couldn't get any more help than we did with summer at he the check out stand, answering all the questions we had. she just had a smile on her face the whole time thanks again we will be back"
5-star,1,my favorite store in the whole world.. i'm a under armour brand fan and love coming here. it's easy to park and can get in and out in a jiffy. the customer service is always good and have a massive selection of clothes. kim was great. helped me find everything i needed.
4-star,1,"located at the premium outlets mall south of the vegas strip. this is an indoor mall for the most part and you'll find the ua entrance on the exterior of the mall front side. they always have discounts of at least 20% to 30% on most things and more on the clearance racks but the good stuff seems to disappear quickly. the inventory changes often so it never hurts to pay them a visit when you're passing by. they also have a nice additional 10% discount for military. it's a small store that covers both male and female products. lots of shoes to browse through and of course workout gear galore. the staff here is friendly and ready to assist. they continually have a selection of low priced t-shirt if you can't find anything else you need (want). being located on the exterior has a benefit in that you don't have to trudge through the mall if you don't feel like it. just walk in and grab (and pay for) what suits you, walk out and your car is ready to take you on the rest of the journey. get your under armour on!"
5-star,1,"i went in to under armor on sunday to get a new sports bra and get my boyfriend an outfit. everyone was so helpful!! i needed a specific size and they checked in the back, i wasn't sure about the sales and everyone gave me answers. i ended my shopping by checking out and had a friendly conversation with the cashier. such a great experience!! i keep under armor as my top workout clothes depot!!"
1-star,0,"i tried giving this place no stars but it wouldn't allow me so i'm just putting 1 star. no greeting, no asking if we needed help (which we did), no smiles, no nothing. i took my $$ and spent it at nike instead. terrible salespeople."
5-star,1,"***10% military discount*** my favorite store in vegas hands down! go straight to the clearance and check out all the deals:o) you will for sure find something but even still, there's always some kind of sale going on in this place. it's not that pricey and i always get a shirt or two whenever i pay them a visit. with the hot vegas sun, dry fit shirts make all the difference. they truly have the best workout gear and last a long time even with excess wear. the folks who work here are also very friendly and helpful, but the 10% military discount is the reason why i go here:o)"
4-star,1,"a great place to get a wide range of workout/sports/activewear for both men and women. the store is pretty jam packed with merchandise. the only place to move around is the dressing room when trying on items. there were plenty of sales people to assist. i found the prices a bit high, but i think i am paying for a name which hopefully in turn means quality that is comfortable and durable. remember that ua is located on the outside of the outlet mall."
1-star,0,i was so excited to go to this store. i was looking for a very specific shoe that a co-worker had purchased from this store. i went to the shoes and could not find it. i was not greeted when i entered. i finally tracked down an employee and told him what i was looking for. he said they didn't have the shoe i wanted and thought they may have carried it before. i noticed a pair of boots that i thought would fit my boy. they were on a clearance rack on the back wall but were not priced. they were in a box without a price in it as well but all other items around them were 44-49.99. i asked the clerk if they had more of the boot because that would have suited my needed as well. he said that was the only pair. i left the store and then decided that i would get the boots for my son if they were on clearance and at outlet prices. i returned and again was not greeted. i got the boots and took them to the counter for a price check. the clerk said they were 119.00. i asked if that was before or after clearance. she said they were not on clearance. she was short and rude about it and said that something in the number is how i would know they were on clearance or not. i felt the experience was not worth my time going back again. also the selection was limited in variety and sizes. i would avoid this store and shop on line in the future.
5-star,1,"---rant--- if i could give you guys ***more than 5 stars*** i would!!! i was looking for their discontinued ru worthy hoodies. they had a few in-store but only in xl and above. suckage since i wear a medium! i already had the blue one and wanted the faded black and great ones. get this...the guy helping me said he'd check in the back...about 15 mins later comes out and says: ua staff - ""we have some in that size but they are at our off-site location. i'd have to drive out and get them. it'll take about 40 mins. would you mind waiting while i drive out there?"" me - ""well if it's gonna take that long i'll just come back tomorrow night. will you be able to have them in-store by 5:30pm?"" ua staff - ""oh yeah for sure. i'll go get them tomorrow morning. they'll be up at the front desk for you."" his manager also came out to confirm this and to get my name and number so they could contact me once they had them in-store. went climbing all day in the canyons, got back to the store later in the evening around 5:30pm...and there they were. two brand new ru worthy hoodies, one black and one grey. so awesome. not only that but they gave me an extra 20% off for the inconvenience. original retail per hoodie: $40+. got both for $30 and change. excellent. ---overall--- service: a+ facility/products: a+, plenty of selections, plenty of sizes available in-store and off-site atmosphere: a+, under armour stores rock~"
4-star,1,"yes...i am a fan of this under armour. if i am ever at the las vegas outlets (south), i always make sure that i stop at this under armour. you never know when they get deals and when they do, they are usually a steal of a price. this store is a little smaller than other ua's out there, but it's clean, the service is good, and the selection is decent. because this particular under armour is a haven for tourist or out-of-towners, a lot of their stuff can be sold out by the time you arrive. always happens to me when i arrive here. i see something, walk the mall, come back and it's gone. next time i will ask them to hold whatever i'm interested in, but rarely do because i'm still in the indecisive mode. tons of shoe deals, workout gear, hats, etc. wish list: -i wish they would expand their line and have some of the merch that you can find in their online store. -deals: one thing i found out is that each under armour may have different deals. i've been to the ontario ca location and this location on the same day. the ca location had one deal and this location didn't. i've also seen the opposite. overall, if you're looking for comfortable workout clothing and even casual wear, stop at this under armour. the staff here is always ready to assist and even will go out of their way to check their back stock. just let them know what you're looking for."
3-star,0,"prices are high. staff was busy talking to one another. i accidentally pulled the wrong coupon out of my purse for 20% off (which we got from the tour of the university), and instead of saying something like ""this coupon isn't applicable,"" or ""this is for a different store,"" the clerk left it on the counter without a word, and charged me full price on the expensive ""clearance"" shirt i was trying to buy. when i took out my money, i realized my mistake and handed her the correct coupon. perhaps communication isn't her strength, but it's not that difficult. she said ""oh!"" that was it. aside from that, the store had a large selection of u of wi apparel. it was a large space, so i didn't see the other stuff they were selling."
4-star,1,i really like this bookstore. i really like that it is so much more than a bookstore. it has all the college gear that a student (or future student/parent/alum/grandparent/baby badger) would ever want. it has a great variety of books (make sure to leave about an hour to scour the basement's selection). grab a coffee at the coffee stand near the front doors. super cheap lattes on thursdays! if you have a badger fan that you need an extra special gift for- this is your place. the prices are not super cheap; but i have seen more expensive gear at other places. their selection of art supplies is pretty cool too. i never leave empty handed...
4-star,1,"typical of any college town book store: it had books, it had clothing, it even had stationary...all the essentials for any college student, alumni, or out of town visitor"
1-star,0,"i was a student once (and no, not a long time ago you jerks), and i worked in customer service once for over five years. yes, it sucks sometimes, and sometimes there are days where you're just completely over it. but it's ridiculous here. every single person who works here gives absolutely no shits about their jobs. a friend and i came in here to pick up some souvenir stuff, and we had a few questions about some merchandise. the kids here act like they're doing you a favor by working there, even though a majority of them were just chatting away about their weekend plans or sitting at the register while on their phones. we wanted to know the price of a duffel bag they had on display, and if it was available for sale since it had no tags. we literally had to ask three different people before we got a straight answer. each one of them didn't know. no one bothered to try to find out, but instead just directed us to another worker. also, i guess in this establishment it's absolutely unheard of to greet a person before speaking to them. the kid at the customer service desk actually gave me the most disgusted-weirded out look as i said hello to him before i asked a question. i actually felt like i offended him by speaking to him! it wasn't like he was busy, all he was doing at the time was folding a pile of shirts! whatever. it's a shame, because they have a huge selection of pretty cool badger merchandise to choose from, but i'd rather give less jerky establishments on state street my business. you don't wanna bother these guys. they've got shirts to fold."
4-star,1,"i'm not going to talk about the books here. i remember the days (long ago) when i barely got a few bucks back for a $250+ textbook while i completely cashed in on others. what i am going to talk about the insane variety of badger gear. and, thus, the insane amount of coin you may drop ensuring that you and every single one of your family members is outfitted in red and white. the university book store is a mecca of everything bucky. things that you couldn't even fathom to rep uw are present here. the selection is choice, the quality is high and so are the prices. do not be shocked to see many a $65+ hoodie. it's the norm. the kiddo and baby section is especially impressive, so definitely stop by and give a look-see for any budding badger. *pro tip - bathroom is in the basement (where all those glorious textbooks lie)."
1-star,0,"what a bloody place. i got a used english text book there. in the beginning of the next semester, i tried to sell it back. the first staff there told me i could get 4 some buck s if i could erase all the marks written inside. well, all the marks were there when i bought it here. if they require every costumer to erase stuff they wrote before they sell the book, how come i got the book with marks in it. now they require me to do this. f* ck that erase the whole book for only 4 dollars! so i left at once since i had other stuff to do. secondly,when i came back to the book store again some hours later to see if i could argue with them. this time, it was another staff there. he told me i could get 2 dollars at most since it was an old edition. f*ck that as well! is it a private business run by individual staff there? i don't think they have a same standard to evaluate the used books. it's a bloody place after all."
2-star,0,"the only pluses i have for the university bookstore are (1) it's location is basically on campus and (2) it has an extensive supply of badger gear. however, it's a bit pricey. you can easily find badger gear (especially tshirts) elsewhere on state street for cheaper. as an art student, i buy a lot of art supplies, and the bookstore's selection is decent, but pricier than other stores. you can find textbooks for cheaper in other places, too. also, i've had a couple bad customer service experiences with a few of the full-time employees. basically, unless you're really just looking for the most convenient option, you can find what you need somewhere else for cheaper."
1-star,0,"the bookstore is, without a doubt, the most corporate bookstore in all of madison. i'd even go so far as to label it a ""big brother"" entity. the benefits of their return policy end within the first month of the semester. i had the ink for my printer cartridge refilled, only to experience problems with it the very next day. sometimes a student is left with no other choice, but i'd recommend any other route available, as far as buying books are concerned. buying books online is not only cheaper, it's also worth the wait."
4-star,1,"ubs is key to college survival; they pretty much have everything you would need in the way of textbooks, school/office supplies, badger gear, and probably stuff you didn't know you needed but upon sight, know that it should be yours. some textbooks can be found for cheaper at other local places, and of course online shopping is always cheaper, but ubs typically has course lists of materials which you can have sent to you, put on reserve in store, or simply show up and grab what you need. i've always found the staff to be really helpful during the rush at the start of the semester, which makes everyone's lives a lot easier. located in library mall, ubs is definitely convenient, and is great to shop for gifts for anyone really. the prices aren't as low as they could be, but that is to be expected by a local store who pretty much owns the college population."
5-star,1,"i could spend all day in the uw bookstore (and have come close before!). in addition to textbooks and everything-you-ever-wanted-with-bucky-the-badger-on-it, they have a great selection of art supplies, pens, and random cool gift things. i love trying out all of the pens. it used to be one of my favorite things to do when a new semester would start. i would reward myself with new pens for surviving the hell that is textbook purchasing. the bookstore also has a great selection of used books for cheap. so now i can buy back all those books i wished i hadn't sold back to the bookstore to buy ramen."
5-star,1,i love this store! every time i've gone in they have given me excellent advice on style and current trends. i was nervous about getting a flower to pin on my jacket but after all the compliments i got on it i was hooked and have returned multiple times to upgrade my look with accessories. it's so great to have a store that just focuses on men's styles and driss is the man when it come to dressing you in pure confidence! thanks to the team here i will always be a client of vercini!
5-star,1,"i was pleasantly surprised by my encounter to this family owned business. they have beautiful items for men, all very unique and exquisite. what made my visit even better was the young man who went above and beyond to assist me in finding the perfect gift!!! i will def recommend this amazing place to everyone who is looking for quality items and amazing customer service! thank you guys, i will def be back soon!"
5-star,1,this shop has amazing deals on men's fashion wear. the guy name driss helped me put together great outfits. they tailor the clothing for a very good price. the results are fantastic. i bought three suits from them. i would highly recommend checking this place out. amazing deals. thanks again driss for your help!! definitely will come back again.
1-star,0,very rude sales person. seriously zero customer service. stay away. if you want to buy a suit with great service go to the vercini in galleria mall. not the mimicked mile mall vercini. the sales man is seriously rude.
5-star,1,"i came to vegas for a wedding and my husband forgot his suit, my friend who is a lifesaver told me about this place where her husband bought his suit. this shop is located inside planet hollywood, as soon as i went into the shop we where greeted by friendly faces. hicham was amazing, we told him are situation and that we needed a suit asap. we ended up paying less than 250 for the suit shirt tie and handkerchief which for vegas was amazing, i once paid 7 bucks for a bottle of water here. the suit quality was better than the one my husband forgot. they had an onsite tailor so we got the suit hemmed in less than 10 min we took longer parking the car than we did getting a suit for my husband. at the wedding my husband got many compliments on his suit."
1-star,0,awful place to shop. i was looking for some pants and the gentleman helping me had no idea what he was doing. i needed my pants tailored and he said he could get it done the same day and he had no idea that the tailor wasn't coming in at all! i found that to be ridiculous. my zipper had broken the same day i got them so i called and asked if i could exchange or have them fix it since i hadn't worn them long before it broke. they pretty much told me they couldn't do anything but that i could call a tailor around town. terrible service and i do not recommend that anyone goes there to get slacks. i paid $120 for shit!
1-star,0,"yesterday in the mail i received a coupon for free panties when you buy one or buy any item, and a few other great coupons. i was extremely excited to use them especially when i went onto my snapchat and saw that victoria secret was giving away $10 off coupons naturally i went to this victoria's secret. upon arriving in the store the first girl that saw me did not bother to come to me and ask me if i was looking for anything as i was actaully looking for things and wanted help and actually thought she was going to reach out to assist. instead she continued to speak with her coworker who was off the clock. i am pretty sure this girl was the manager because she was checking bags and asking other girls if they wanted to go on the lunch. i circled around and when i still could not find what i was looking for and still have not been greeted by any other person because she was the only person on the floor i decide to go up to her at ask her about the coupon. when i asked her about the coupon she seemed like she had no idea what it was for and proceeded to tell me that it was good for both sides of the store both pink and victoria's secret i double asked her just to make sure because it did only say victoria's secret on the coupon nothing about pink. so i went about shopping and then was forced to ask her yet another question about the sale items she was helpful but not very friendly or very interested in assisting me in purchasing a bra or showing me her favorites like normal pink associates do. as i was picking out the underwear i wanted the girl continue to talk to four of her coworkers who were leaving for the day they were chatting and calling one of the other coworkers weird not any of them decided to help me look for a pair. when i got to the front the girl was averagely nice however, they gave me a hard time about my coupon and it wasn't until i told them it was for sure for this location did they bother to look it up and find out i was in fact correct. by the way i was correct it was only for of the victoria secret side. i left with what i was looking for but with mediocre service disappointed in this victoria secret as the one at arrowhead mall always has tons of people in it and they still manage to keep their customer service excellent. this mall is slow and they should be eager for clients not just shoo them off and give them a i don't care attitude."
5-star,1,"i went to this victoria's secret yesterday, the first 3 associates didn't acknowledge me but then i came a crossed adrianna she was great! she resized me and helped me find the right fit for my bra, she was super personable!"
2-star,0,"worst victoria secret i've ever been to. i say that having visited several since in this county and others in different cities and states. selection is limited which is expected given the location so doesn't bother me. it's the customer service that's abysmal. i'm am avid vs shopper or was...and have vsisited this location several times. now the service here has never been great with maybe 1 or 2 staff who knew what good customer service was. they appear to have hired new staff however who are clueless about their sales and promotions, terrified about theft so are pretty offensive in their practices. one in particular requires me to practice quite a bit of restraint. i would highly recommend you not come here."
1-star,0,i typically don't write reviews for retailers but this victoria's secret is the worst i've ever been to. not only was the selection of items terrible but the store was cluttered and disorganized. after picking out a few items we waited in the long line that seemed like it wasn't moving. instead of simply ringing customers up the sales associates were trying to sell items at the register for every single customer. it took 15 minutes to finally make us decide to leave our items and leave the store. the sales associates have no consideration for those in line and were asking the customers to go pick out more items to reach a certain amount to get a free gift. so we had to stand in line and watch people walk off to continue shopping while we wait in line for them. waste of 45 minutes. i didn't expect to need over an hour to pick out a few items.
1-star,0,"i was treated horribly at the pv mall location! i was ignored multiple times by the sales girls when looking for the 2 for $40 top and yoga pants in size large. the sales reps looked past me and even helped a woman that was stealing product and looked as if she had just shot up illegal drugs! apparently if you aren't a size 0 to 4 you can't be assisted or respected at victoria's secret. once my skinny sister in law got the attention of an employee i was laughed at and told they carry x-small to medium!!! this is false if you look online but i didn't want to pay shipping... anyhow, this all happened in front of my sister in law and daughter as well so you can imagine how horrifying this must have felt for a woman that is not an hourglass!!! i do not see myself giving one more hard earned cent to victoria secret. just sad - because i like their tops but refuse to let my daughter see me treated so badly and grow up believing that is ok or that she'll have to be skinny to be respected! very,very, very disappointed in this retailer."
1-star,0,"this vs is abysmal. they have nowhere near the selection the fashion square store has and this is with regard to sizes, colors, and merchandise variety. many bras are not in stock here that the other store has, as well as many colors/variations not in stock here. and it's very hard to find ddd cup bras that can easily be found at fashion square. very frustrating experience all round. not to mention, vs is notorious for measuring busts incorrectly and that is no different at this location. i feel like they often measure you incorrectly just to stuff you into one of their bras instead of telling you they don't go beyond a certain cup size and you'd be better served going to a retailer with a larger range of sizes. i think that's unethical and dubious. i'll stick to shopping at the fashion square location or the website!"
1-star,0,"had the most dreadful experience in this awfully run store this afternoon, compelling me to write this review. what should be a place where customers receive one-on-one attention is nothing more than a self-service nightmare. between a very new salesperson who was not even familiar with vs's new currently advertised ""multi-way"" amongst other things, a male salesperson with no follow-up and a dis-interested store manager who i pleaded for to help me and simply installed me a dressing room with 2 suggestions and left, i felt like i was in a bad dream. determined to purchase a desperately needed bra i chose something similar to a previous purchase and got in line to pay. i was 2nd in line and waited and waited while the new, aforementioned sales gal now on cashier duty (along with the male salesperson) asked the manager for help to no avail. the manager could not be bothered though there was clearly an escalating stall at the registers. after a while, i got out of line, handing my selections to the busy, shelf-stocking manager and told her that this was a truly horrible shopping experience and good bye. she did not say a word. that is the end of me shopping there."
2-star,0,"had a few bad experiences unfortunately in just one visit. the associates had no intention on being courteous, they even seemed to run away or roll their eyes to avoid me. i had to walk to the cashier to ask for help, she willingly helped me, answered my questions. when i was about to walk out, the alarm went off and i was not even close to the door, one of the associates quickly pointed me out, and loudly said ""can you come here i gotta check if their is anything in there"" meaning my bag. he gave me his back the whole time, and didn't even look at me to say i was good to go. he just said your fine. that's it. so rude."
1-star,0,"before now, i've never been ignored by sales associates when the store is virtually empty. maybe the exhaustion from all of the weekend's sales drained all of the sales luster. despite my fitting room request light being lit for over 5 min with no attendant ever coming to my assistance, i still managed on my own. spending over $100 at an establishment deserves at least a little customer assistance."
1-star,0,"if i could give this place zero stars, i would. well guys, i just got back from victoria's secret and same old same old. i hate coming here for a number of reasons. 1. does anyone ever work here?? every time i walk in theres like nobody working. i will see 2 girls at most and their always busy helping other people or ""pretending to look busy"" .. if i am lucky enough to get someones attention and speak to an associate there always so damn rude!! some things i've noticed with the sales associates are their middle aged woman trying to be ""sexy"". excuse me but its not my fault that your a middle aged woman working retail in a mall, so please change your attitude towards me and give me some service. 2. whenever i find what i need theres hardly ever any selection, they are always out of my size or color or style and im left with the leftovers. 3. the victoria secret deals are complicated at this location. i always have a problem whenever i bring in a free panty card or a ten dollars off card. etc. they always mess up my transactions and i always have to return and fix it. and when i do try to come back and fix it im left with their attitudes again like they didnt mess anything up? i remember one time i came in and asked a sales associate if this deal was still going on where if you spend a certain amount of money say 70 bucks you get a free duffle bag.. she said yes so i did some shopping and went to check out. when i got to the register the lines were soooooo long. when i finally made it to the front and made my purchases i had noticed that the lady had forgotten my duffle bag so i went back to the store and politely told her and she responds ""oh we ran out"". excuse me?? if you had ran out of duffle bags why didnt you tell me when i had asked you when i walked in the store?? i was so angry. this is my 6th time coming back here and idk why i do, i guess i just have some sort of hope that my next visit will always be better. but no, eek, me thinks not."
1-star,0,"their service is horrible which is a surprise because nobody its hardly in there. i visit a vs store 2-3 times a month. i came into this site it was bout really packed i needed help and was ignored the whole time. someone came in i heard the ""welcome to victoria secret, can i help you find anything"" it kinda felt like a slap in my face. when i was paying for my stuff the woman asked if anyone helped me. i had explained to her that everyone ignored me when i seeked help m the service was horrible. all she did was continue to ignore and have a dude conversation. i ended up leaving the stuff i was going to buy because i was so disgusted."

2-star,0,"-1 couldn't find my size in the drawers. +1 a nice rep found it for me. +0 was the wrong fit. +1 she came in and measured me and let me know my size had changed. -1 she also told me that my size will change when ""you gain 10 lbs."" fellow yelpers, you know there are photos on this site. that's all i'll say about that comment, which could really hurt someone's feelings if they really do have a weight issue. +1 the item was on sale! -1 no one working the register. -1 same rep decides to avoid eye contact with me instead of pointing me to the lotion side of the store to open registers - i had no idea i was standing in line at a set of registers that no one was even keyed in at. -1 when i do realize there are other registers open, i am nearly knocked down by another customer who had to ""beat"" me to them so she could put $13 on her vs card account. nice work, hon."
1-star,0,the worst vs ever! seriously! the store is a mess. the girls are really rude. i would rather drive to another store then visit this one.
1-star,0,"the worst vs i have ever visited! i browsed for about 15 minutes before one of the four employees greeted me on a slow weeknight. they were pretty busy talking and joking around with each other despite the entire store being in disarray - the panties and bras throughout were messy, unfolded and in all different size drawers."
5-star,1,"this store is a great place to look for pink clothing or lingerie, the staff kinda follow you around and it gets kinda weird after a while but other than that i enjoy coming over here for my sexy clothes and pj's. its worth it to get a credit card if you frequently shop here because you get lots of coupons and emails for exclusive private shopping events."
4-star,1,"this location is amazing. because i work on this side of town, and live in central phoenix- i pretty much have to drive super east or super west to get to a victoria's secret. this location is large, and always has lots of cute chicks working to help you along the way. i had forgotten about the semi-annual sale and was pleasantly surprised that even though i went after the prime sale time, this location still had quite a few goodies for me (i spent over $100 so clearly finding stuff wasn't an issue). i've only ever had one obnoxious customer service issue, but other than that, the girls are always super helpful and kind. if you're in the area, stop on in- this mall is notorious for it's little kiosk people being aggressive so just politely say ""no thank you"" and head to the pink monstrosity."
4-star,1,"everyones so pretty. the store smells so nice. as much as i despise shopping at desert sky mall, i have enjoyed my visits to victoria's secret & pink (which are located side by side with no divider between the stores) very much so. the employees are generally nice and it is very clean, much cleaner than some other locations i've been too.... for gifts of course."
2-star,0,"disgustingly dirty & understaffed! i feel bad for complaining because the girls that helped me were friendly and efficient but so can only help so many people?! decent selection of products but footprints at the checkout counter? gross! & did you see the picture of the dust bunnies or maybe they should be called dust elephants?!? fine in a pinch but don't be in a hurry.... sad really, i am sure they want more help."
3-star,0,the employees were not super helpful and honestly a bit bratty. i love the brand. probably will just buy online with a better selection.
4-star,1,"i subtracted a star for customer service. as it was the semi annual sale, i would have expected to see more sales associates on the floor. moving on. the selection of bras was great (i even scored a bombshell on sale!), as was their lipstick/lip gloss selection for only $2.99 each! i grabbed a couple, then discovered they had 1.7 oz. perfumes, orig. $60 down to $19.99...score!! there was so much more i saw there that i wanted to buy, but i don't have an unlimited budget! after grabbing a couple more things, i breezed through the checkout. the cashier was quick and efficient. love this location, and i will be back!"
1-star,0,horrible customer service!!!! i will drive much further than needed in order to go to a vs that will treat me with respect and like my business actually matters.
2-star,0,"i do all of my underwear shopping here, but today they really get an ""f"" on customer service. sent my husband this morning to pick up specific panties for me, at 10am when they are supposed to open. he waited outside till 10:30 with no one in sight and no sign on the door. i finally reached them them via phone at noon and they said the power had been out. i asked if they could please set aside the items i had sent my husband to pick up, so that when he had to return, he could just run in and pick up. they left me on hold for awhile only to return and say they would not do that because ""my purchase $$ amount was not big enough to have one of there staff grab the items from the floor for me."" hmmm... i guess their customer service depends on how much $$ your transaction will be. bad business ladies!!"
1-star,0,"i've been into this store twice and each time i've been ignored. i've had several of the employees look me dead in the face and then either keep talking to each other or walk away. however, they talk to the people who walk in behind me or in front of me. it's amazing to still see such blatant racism. i usually love victoria secret but now i'm skeptical about shopping at any of the stores."
1-star,0,extremely poor customer service. employees where beyond disrespectful to my mother and were trying to refuse to give her her id back after trying to make an exchange. love the company but this location is terrible customer service.
1-star,0,"i went in to buy myself a birthday present. they had a great deal on pink yoga pants. $25.00, i saw it online! i stood in line for 30 minutes (!!!!) while two girls rang up customers and two girls hang stuff up behind them (really? you didn't see the line with 7+ people in it??). finally get up there and the yoga pants rang up $46. the girl went and checked and came back and said they're not $25. so i asked her which ones are then?? she took me back there and couldn't even show me. both the girls working there said ""they're mixed in.. all over the place."" i informed them that these are on the website as $25 and all alyssa could say is ""i'm not sure why"". needless to say, i didn't get the yoga pants, however i did call and complained and am having them shipped to my house (at no cost because happy valley vs girls don't know the product they're selling!) i'm not quite sure how a store can run effectively when you don't know your sales or product. not to mention.. people have better things to do than stand in line. stay away from this store, at least until they get rid of there seasonal employees."
1-star,0,terrible customer service.. the employees while being wonderful are severely understaffed. spending this much money for the lingerie ya think they could afford to hire more staff.. corporate greed showing up again
5-star,1,"super amazing customer service. they greeted us at the door. then they figured out a couple of bras for me to try. then those didn't work and they got my size corrected. then they got me to try on 8 more bras. then they suggested the perfect bra! when they didn't have it in black, they ordered it online and shipped it to my house. seriously i already loved vs but this location is superb on their customer focus."
5-star,1,this is my favorite vs location. they have the friendliest most helpful staff. the sales girl alex is fabulous i would want her as an employee if i still had my retail business! definitely a lot more fun less stressful and frustrating than shopping at the arrowhead mall location.
5-star,1,angela and bre were so helpful!!! i went in to buy some things for my daughter and angela was very helpful. i had to go back a couple of days later with my daughter to exchange some sizes and angela was there and remembered me and was once again very sweet! bre ( not sure of the spelling) was very helpful at the register. this isn't really the closest store to me but it is worth the drive!
5-star,1,"the girls working here are so helpful! i was fitted properly, and everyone was so inviting! one of the employees even help me pick out several bras that fit the style i wanted"
5-star,1,"i'm pretty sure her name is bianca and she's so cute and helpful, she def helped me and my best friend have a great experience here!"
2-star,0,"this location only gets 2 stars because their customer service is up and down. some girls seem genuinely nice and others are snobbish! wish arizona would focus on good customer service but that's a bit much to ask for i guess? one employee that was working the floor ignored me when i asked a question the first time and when she finally answered my question, she was short with me and didn't seem to care. but when another (white) customer asked her a question, she was peppy and attentative to her. she has long black hair, i might as well be describing every employee there but its worth a shot. treat all customers with respect or at least fake it! not going to this location again. gbye!"
5-star,1,"very clean place. all the employees are super nice and there is a lot of them so you don't have to wander around the store forever just to find someone to help you. the store is very organized and easy to find stuff, the drawers for certain stuff are surprisingly clean compared to other victoria's secret stores i've been too. the store is super big so there is definitely a lot of things in it to look for."
5-star,1,"after frequenting countless vs stores over the years, in numerous states, and having been in the fashion & beauty industry for over a decade, i am happy to report that this vs store went above and beyond and met my needs--total client satisfaction. the staff was attentive, yet not overbearing, and more than knowledgable about their product--an obvious result of strong management training. the store was impeccable, product replenishment was plentiful, and i easily found what i needed. the dressing rooms are beautiful ( love the mirrors!) and the cashwrap experience was efficient as well. of all the vs stores in the valley, this is the one i will be returning to. though it may not have the wider array of selections like arrowhead or fashion square does, the cleanliness, client service, and efficiency wins my loyalty."
5-star,1,"if you are looking to travel back in time, head over to vintage joes! i walked in here last month and was taken back by all childhood knock knacks and old signs. joe is also creative and makes some really cool bird houses and other things. next time i'm in i'll be grabbing a root beer float. joe was raving about it!"
5-star,1,"drove pretty far for this location ! this stuff is pretty cool ! one of a kind piece, things from my childhood and the best root beer floats around. if anything come for the root beer floats !!!"
5-star,1,"saw this awesome little shop from across the street and was super glad i decided to stop in. joe (the owner) was super friendly and welcoming and my friend and i enjoyed talking to him. the shop had reasonably priced vintage items including records, board games, jewelry, and many more little treasures as well as super cool original artwork. joe told me that the piece i bought was made with his daughters, which made it even more special! there's a soda bar and seating in the back that i'll have to check out next time! serious collectors and curious shoppers will enjoy this place alike and i will definitely be coming back to shop and hang out with my friends! amazing local business! #girlsrock"
5-star,1,"saw this little store from dutch bros and thought it looked cool, super laidback atmosphere including a soda bar and couches! wide variety of vintage items! vintage joe, himself, greeted us and showed us around the store :d awesome artwork and cool artsy lamps #girlsrock"
5-star,1,"this was a shop i had seen on 3tv earlier in the week. knowing i was going to be in n. scottsdale later this week, i made a note to stop by. i was met by joe with a greeting and a big smile. it's a new shop, decorated with classic americana covering the walls and the display cabinets. myself, being a classic vinyl record collector, gravitated to the 1970-80s records. after picking out a half a dozen items, i looked over some hand-made silver and gem stone pieces, that were made by one of joe's older daughters. this place has been built to expand and joe set up the back of the shop as an old fashioned soda shop and plans for expansion to a restaurant. i think he's on to something great here! if you're a collector, there's a little something for everyone. lunch boxes, records, the vinyl type, board games, candies, and more! i'll be sipping a classic soda in the back of the shop with a smile!"
5-star,1,"this walmart is great. since it's brand new & even though it's in the good hood, it's super clean, well kept & the cosmetics section is one of the best i've ever seen. they have the maybelline superstay foundation & the entire color range for the brand new covergirl foundation. the only brand they don't carry at this location is physician's formula. this location also always had a huge selection of air freshener items in the cleaning aisle & that's why i keep coming back. it's smaller than a regular super walmart but still has everything you need."
1-star,0,"for a newer store the air conditioning is terrible! i could not even shop, i feel bad for the employees. i was told by the employees the air conditioning is controlled by a out of state company."
5-star,1,been here a few times and wasn't so pleased with the service. the five stars are not for the store but for the cashier that was at register 8 today around 3:15 pm. his name was nicholas. what a great asset to this store. he should train a lot of the other employees on how to treat customers. he went beyond his job and carried a conversation that he started just by paying attention the the items i was purchasing. definitely manager material. thank you nicholas!
1-star,0,trash service. a customer was saying he went to this location for 10 years and a manager said hello to him for the first time. the employees wearing a yellow vest dropped a peace of paper and started to cuss in front of a family with kids. my advice is to advoid this location.
1-star,0,"went here another time a couple weeks later, once again with a cart full of stuff (which we got frustrated and abandoned about $300 worth of items and this was the 3rd time i did this, never again!) we had to battle long lines, and only 2 registers open when there had to be at least 400 people in the store!! come on!!! i will be utilizing other stores and will be researching online. this company is way to big for their britches, if you don't feel the need for customer service but there is no way we could bankrupt the evil that is walmart so they obviously don't care because they don't need their customers to survive they already made their deal with the devil apparently."
2-star,0,"store is clean, but always children running around unsupervised while screaming and sketchy people everywhere. also insane how you can have 2 lanes wrapped around the store and still remain to only have 2 lanes open... open more lanes. literally watch employees stand around and watch the lines."
2-star,0,"i skimmed the other reviews posted so far and i'm actually surprised no one has mentioned the noise. i'm between this walmart, christown, and the one on 35th ave and bethany. sure, the metro walmart is large and carries more products, but there's a bone jarring humming coming from the ceiling through most of the grocery section. it's this loud, deep, and vibrating hum like a thousand a/c units are about to explode on the roof or something. i've never heard a noise like this anywhere except scenes in moves when ufos are landing. it's bad enough to where i don't like having to go to this walmart even though i should just because of the wider selection."
5-star,1,"big store. clean. plenty of handy parking. lots of choices. great location. the pickup for online ordering is right inside the door, not way back at the back of the store, so you don't have to walk a mile to get there. and....comfy chairs to sit in while they fetch your order. i love this wal-mart. there was even samples in the food section on the weekend, wow! don't forget your donut at an awesome price. there is something for eveyone, and if you are not in the mood to shop, eat at the in store subway. place to relax."
2-star,0,"this is a nice new store, but..... this,store has lot of problems. twice i have gone to buy fat free milk and twice there was none. how can this happen. i also went to get syringes at the pharmacy a couple day after the store was opened they did no have any. i started to look around and found hundreds of racks and spaces empty. what gives? i also saw this through the store. i hope this is not the way the store will be managed. as usual it is the responsibility of management to keep the store shelves full. i hope because this is a new store this will cgange!"
2-star,0,"i generally don't shop at walmart & when the moment arrives, i remember why. today i arrived just before 7pm to pickup an online order. i checked in . there are no clear instructions on what to do after check in. so i sat down & waited. the unhappy service members never asked if i needed assistance nor acknowledged my presence. so i approach june, who told me i needed to tell "" the other girl when she shows up"" i asked if there was a large cart bcuz i was to pick up a large item. she walkie-talkied someone to bring the cart. i noticed the item ordered sitting along the isle. i asked chris & he in turn asked june who then asked another associate to do the transaction because she didn't want to. quote. for a new store that just opened it was quite a show. i only went upon a request. i won't shop at walmart even tho i was tempted to purchase a tv. but even the low price couldn't persuade me due to the terrible customer service. i know that my experience doesn't really matter in the eyes of walmart - but it matters to me. but they have plenty of parking - only good thing i experienced."
1-star,0,black friday ad says they have iphone x. my husband went in the day before and asked if they had the iphone x and the employee said they had a ton. on thanksgiving thursday we go in at 8pm and the employees all say they never got the shipment of iphone x's. went to a different walmart and said the same thing. frustrating!
4-star,1,"i like this new walmart. it is one of the super centers so it is huge. since it was my first time i walked around for a long time before i decided to do shopping. i went back to get my cart and then went to the bedding because a friend told me they have really nice pillows at walmart. i got a couple and i am sleeping better! it is hard to beat their prices. i found a sous vide machine cheaper than anywhere else, even amazon. they have a large grocery section which is impressive. i buy hot dogs to give the dogs their medications and they seem to be able to beat other stores' prices by about a dollar. one thing i have not been impressed with is their steak but for the most part good stuff. i did not see any organic, free range turkeys though! one thing i thought was interesting was the store is attached to the mall but you can't enter from the mall. i guess they don't want you strolling with your shopping cart through the mall and leaving it in the mall parking!"
1-star,0,this is for the wal-mart at metro center station mall phenix az. 1st off i never saw a bit of security. they must be to scared to go out of the store. everything is locked down inside. i had to get a soecial associate to unlock the doubke locked security case to get a bike innertube. after paying which was a nightmare of people self checkouting and having constant additional item or over weight item issues i finally got checked out it took about 20 minutes. two times groups of latinos tried to mess with me as i left the store. all i bought was a bike innertube and got messed with 2 times going to my truck. both times they tried to grab my bag away from me. a clerk i talk to got transferred there and plans to quit if tthey can not get transferred out. pretty bad wehen t he employees want tyo run from a store.
5-star,1,"usually hate walmart but this one is new & cleaner than most. everyone was friendly... like, actually smiling & helpfully, plenty of parking, carts were available . no complaints. so far so good."
4-star,1,this is my go to wal-mart as its close to home. i am always able find what i'm looking for and this location is hardly ever sold out on items. this location is hardly ever busy so no need to worry about long line ups!
4-star,1,"the walmart is at the perfect location near my house :) have halal chicken available, roasted. no issues with the line-up, not like i buy 12+ items anyways from here. has a lot of essential items and its never too busy (not sure if that is a good thing for the business)."
4-star,1,"markham has a handful of walmart stores. this one is the newer one out of the batch, which is located east of ninth line. i like this walmart. staff are always happy to help with you if you have any questions. lineups are shorter here than at most walmart stores. i can always find what i need here. produce looks fresh every time i visit. i like the individual cheesecake slices that you can get. you can get a cheesecake slice to go or bring it to work. perfect! aisles are wide. i tend to get bottles of peanuts. there are plenty of varieties and decent prices. washrooms are clean. you can get your hair done and even visit axess law to get a divorce, if you needed to. i'm not kidding! talk about one-stop shopping! i wish that this walmart were closer to my home. otherwise, i'd be at this one more often. (24)"
4-star,1,"this is the only walmart location i actually enjoy shopping at when i need to buy some essentials. it's spacious, clean, and the staff that work here are very friendly and outgoing. the customer service counter is great and there are never long lineups like at other locations. sometimes i wish they'd open more cash lanes, as it does get busy during peak hours. they do somewhat pressure you into getting a walmart card, which i've noticed they have a tally chart each day by the customer service counter totaling the number of cards activated for each cashier, and i assume that they receive some type of reward at the end of day for."
1-star,0,still the closest walmart to home but still doesn't have the items i sometimes want. would rather go to stouffville. plus i've been screwed twice here with incorrect prices marked on the shelf as opposed to what the item scans in at. always scan your items or check carefully when at the cashier. either their scanning computer program is nutty or they have incompetent people inputting pricing into their system. that is why i have now lowered this location to only a one star rating.
4-star,1,"i love this walmart because it doesn't have a long lineup, the parking is never full and when they have things on sale, i can usually get it here. also, it seems much cleaner here, probably because it's an isolated location. it's one of the larger centers than the ones in markham. it's basically an isolated walmart supercenter store close to boxgrove plaza and ninth line if you're ever on the border east side of markham. other than that, it's walmart, things they sell here are similar to the rest, prices are low, as always."
1-star,0,worst walk in clinic. had to wait 1:45 mins for a 5 min check up. better to go to a real clinic and book an appointment. walk ins are bs and a total waste of time.
3-star,0,"i like this location as it never feels busy. the parking lot is huge, they have a large grocery section, you can always find a shopping cart and it's never crowded as you move through the aisles. it's the exact opposite of the markville location. i'm not crazy about their fruits, vegetables and bakery selection - quality is not as good as longo's or loblaws but it is much cheaper. my only real complaint is the number of cashiers. when you go ""off hours"" they often have only 1 or 2 lanes open. i waited approx 30 minutes on two occasions to get through the cash - that's just unacceptable in my opinion. they have express checkout lanes but they are useless if you have a full cart. oh... also, why can't people return their carts after use? i'm always worried that a rogue cart is going to crash into my car. this location is particularly bad for this."
5-star,1,the ladies in the morning are always saving my life (at the registers) they are always helping me with whatever i need. most of them know my name and are super nice when they see me. they are so sweet to me. super friendly and all the guys in the back are super helpful too. all of them are super nice and they've saved my life a couple times!! ;-)
1-star,0,this walmart is so unprofessional i've been in line for 30 minutes 2nd person sandy and elyse then tell me they can't allow me to pay my bills.
4-star,1,"love this walmart! large parking area and prices are way more inexpensive than smith's. the store has everything for the fridge and a small area for bathroom products like deodorant, shaving cream, hair products and feminine products. self checkout is available and staff is good about asking if assistance is needed. only came across two cashiers (one was rude and the other was lazy-not wanting to get receipt tape) definitely will be back!"
1-star,0,"horrible service!! i just went to the walmart and per their rules and regulation we are able to provide online ads for price matching! i was turned away by all associations and due to my time constraint i asked for the store number and left. upon contacting the gm she proceeded to instantly become combative and rude, her name teresa valdez. she advised the current gm located on the receipt lisa knichel was not the gm and the rule for all walmart has always been no online ads. after disconnecting with her i did my research and found they do, so i called back. teresa got on and started if they were not printed she would not accept and it is based on her discretion to allow, completely untrue!! i feel completely disrespected by the way i was treated and told untrue information!!!"
5-star,1,"i've seen this walmart change with management! the department managers are always a help! most of the time everything i need is here. the associates here actually walk with you to the items you're looking for. that's awesome! the old managements are why this store has some low ratings! this is the 1st up to date rating! right now it is a friendly, fast, low priced, and most of the items are in stocked! also a huge plus is the clearance area has some mind blowing sales!"
1-star,0,"i was stopping here more often than not (averaged 3 days a week), because they are close and clean. unfortunately elyse at the""customer service"" desk brought it to a halt. i received a $20 bill from a debit card purchase. it wasn't accepted at the gas station, nor any of the slot machines at the gas station. i returned to walmart thinking that perhaps they got scammed....i waited half an hour to be told it was not counterfeit, and elyse would know, she took a class on fake money! well thank god, she could lecture me and accuse me of having created said money; even though she said it was real. and i had to wait for a manager's approval, so that the money-verification wizard, elyse, could break it for me. wow. this was the fourth trip in three days, by the way. i said i would stop shopping with this company after they ruined my tires (yes, two! and rims) and locked my car keys inside the car. i damn sure will not voluntarily contribute any funds to a place who hires people like elyse. i work hard for mine, she should too!"
1-star,0,thief....dishonest staff...her name is juliet a pinay cashier...customer service !!!beware.... her hands too fast like a thief i wonder how long this dishonest woman named juliet been doing this to customers. her supervisor check the cashier she said it correct money.i request for them to check the camera in which they did. so i waited 30 minutes for them to check..customers were looking at me...the superbisore came back and said i only gave 2 20$?? so what happen to my other 20$?? juliet knows how to play games and hide such act from camera...shes been working there know ciz i i shop here 3x a weeek..why cant they check her pocket coz i was open to xheck all my pockets and open my purses.i have 2 witnesses they saw 3 20$ bills. just so sad that mgmgtm from walmart are protecting their people .the higher mgmr should see this and teach honesty as part of walmarts culture. so sad that this juliet for 20$ at her age will do such dishonest act.. i came back after i post this and talk to juliet.i told her how dishonest she was and that she will be featured in social media. she cant even look at me..she was looking down without any words to say. the supervisor asked my mom shes was with me at the time.. if i found the 20$ bill.my mom said ..how can my daughter find it..its in good hands of this dishonest woman..ewwwww embarassing place. so again...customers beware...
1-star,0,i have never had a more unpleasant encounter at walmart than i had today with maritza she was rude from the moment i walked up to the stand to return a few items i didn't need with my receipt it's was like i was intruding on her day by just walking up and asking for her assistance then when i asked for her name she wouldn't give it to me when i asked for the manager she laughed and said really then told me to shush when i began to get upset i do not appreciate being treated as a burden just because i need to make a return with a receipt
4-star,1,this walmart neighborhood market is a great for a quick in and out. everything that you need (for the most part) is there. i prefer to shop here in 20 mins or less. prices are good. lines go quick. they have one of the best pharmacies in vegas. the head pharmacist is a nice young guy who doesn't look like a pharmacist but is super knowledgeable. his staff is helpful also. they can fill your prescriptions pretty quickly while you shop in the store. just keep in mind that they close for lunch so plan your trips around that time so you don't unnecessarily get angry.
1-star,0,i ordered this chicken and it was burned beyond belief and this is definitely not the first time i am highly dissatisfied and quite frankly disappointed
5-star,1,"i feel like this is an average, good walmart! when i buy something, it exceeds my expectations lol. i buy dinner here a lot when i run out of money, and the hot wings are my favorite! it's got a pharmacy and 2 redbox machines inside. this store is probs the gem of the corner of stores that surround it ;)"
4-star,1,i never feel like we are getting ripped off for our hard earned money by shopping here. reasonably priced and clean environment. i actually love it.
4-star,1,i like to go here early in the morning because it is quiet. you can get what you need quickly without the drama of going to the big wally world on decatur. i only go to the big one if i absolutely cannot avoid it. they almost everything you would need so check it out! plus it's right next to my gym so it's super coveinent!!
4-star,1,"wal mart neighborhood store - these mini wal marts are all over the las vegas area. they are open 24/7 except christmas. the night employees do a lot of stocking and cleaning but can ring you up or answer a question. these are more like a small albertson's or vons, with wal mart prices and emphasizes food items. there are no lawn mowers, televisions. appliances, nor clothing of their supercenters. this store has none of the ghetto, dirty, barf on the floor smells of the craig st. wal mart supercenter. they have a few of a lot of items. prices are usually the same as their supercenter stores. for example, their whole chicken is regularly 79 cents a pound, an 18 pack of large eggs are $2.49, and they carry most of the wal mart line of generic medicines like ibuprofen (generic advil), calcium tablets, bandages, cough medicines that are far cheaper than anyone else. to get more items in a smaller store, they stack things up on higher shelves. employees will be glad to help but you have to wait. soi often have old ladies ask me to get something off the high shelves. though i am only 5''7"". on preparing for a feast on holidays like thanksgiving and christmas eve, this store is a savior. you can get in and out within a hour, but when they have their self serve line, i've been in and out in 10 minutes buying five items. they have a small deli, small bakery, bottled water machine in store, a pharmacy, clean bathrooms, and some seasonal sales, like bedding plants in spring, pumpkins galore during halloween, and pointsettias and christmas trees in december. the $8.00 pointsettias were $1.00 on christmas eve, and the cheapskates were buying several as gifts. employees are pretty nice, and willing to help you find something if you need it. overall, i am a fan. this is less than a mile from my relatives, and am so glad they're around.and so far, like many vegas grocery and dept. stores, there aren['t any one armed bandit gambling machines."
4-star,1,"while i hate supporting walmart, because of their exploitative employment practices, i have regularly (and shamefully) shopped at this store due to its proximity to my house. i decided to review this store, however, because on each visit i have been astounded by the incredible customer service. one time, i was shopping for items for a work event and i accidentally threw away the receipt. i called walmart and donna immediately offered to help. she searched for the receipt, printed it, and faxed it to me all within a few hours. she was so pleasant and accommodating on the phone. since that visit donna has assisted me several times to find certain items or fix the self-checkout machine (i am totally inept at those machines). she has such a warm and welcoming demeanor, and works hard to brighten the customers' days. she is such an asset to walmart--they are truly lucky to have her on their team!! alisha is another walmart employee who has gone above and beyond to make my visits to walmart memorable, in a good way! alisha often works at the customer service desk, which i stop by frequently to get money orders. alisha always has a huge smile on her face. she is very patient, and always confirms everything before acting--an important skill when printing nonrefundable money orders. walmart neighborhood market has incredible employees who work hard to give their customers a positive experience. walmart should work just ad hard to support these people upon whom their business relies."
1-star,0,"walk mart strikes again! i ordered eclipse glasses online for pickup at the neighborhood maket. online order said i had to order a minimum of $30. i added to my order and there was no warning that the glasses were not in stock. in fact it said they were in stock here!! i added to my order and came to pick it up and they said oh by the way, no glasses are in stock. the whole reason i ordered was for the glasses but they conveniently didn't say they they didn't have them until pickup!! i was duped!"
2-star,0,"deli only has 1 person working in it and they close at 8 pm. there's no consistency to what this store sells and what it doesn't sell. what i mean is you find bbq ribs, whole rotisserie chickens, wings, or you might find zero hot food at all. the shelved products are the same way. it had no diet gingerale canada dry for 3 weeks because the vendor kept stocking regular in the diet slot as well. bread is the same way. you may see sara lee breakfast bread once then never again. i used to buy shelled sunflower seeds in a yellow bag for a $1.93 here, but once they sold out, they never restocked the product. shelves are stocked according to what they have to stock not to the plannagram of what should be in a certain space. it's definitely not normal to buy something at a grocery store for weeks, and then, suddenly without warning, the place where that product goes stays empty unstocked or the wrong product is put in the wrong empty spot! produce is going bad as well. i don't know if the store has not built up their customer base up enough since recently opening or what, but tonight i wanted anjou fresh pears, and the ones they had were all not ripe at all or over ripe to the point of having squishy cuts and holes in them, i wanted roma plum tomatoes but all the ones they had were way too squishy and overripe, i wanted cucumbers but all the ones they had were too short and skinny and were marked up with bruises, i wanted green bell peppers but all the ones they had were damaged or way too small like they were picked too soon. this is frustrating to go thru a produce dept and not be able to find anything on your list that's fresh and correctly ripened. the lady that normally works in the deli is very nice but slow. if someone is ahead of you, expect to wait at least 15 minutes or longer. there's usually another 2 employees in this area, but oddly, they never assist the deli lady! this is beyond frustrating! i won't be shopping here anymore because of the inconsistencies! i can't find half the items on my shopping list because of these errors!"
1-star,0,"i despise this particular walmart, it seems a lot more ""walmart"" then other walmarts. every time i pull up there are always a ton of employees smoking just in front of the door! they used to stand on the side at a table but they have all moved up front so you have to go through disgusting smoke to get inside. the inside also seems so dark all the time."
4-star,1,"this is a very nice walmart if you're looking to pick up some groceries, especially if you're in a hurry. they only have food and home products (hence the market name), so don't come if you're looking for electronics, toys, decor, or anything like that. the produce selection is very good and very fresh, especially for a walmart. the dairy and meat selections are a little lacking in variety but not quality of items, same with the store as a whole. it's a smaller store, so you might not find the item you're looking for if it's a very specific product, but as a whole they seem to keep things well stocked and you should be able to find any staple foods you'd need. also they have a ton of self-checkout lanes, so if you're looking to get in and out quickly i'd highly recommend this location."
2-star,0,"this is not the best walmart, for sure. positives: most of the few checkout people are efficient and friendly. the vision center people are good. prices are reasonable. parking lot is a good size. negatives: awful managers. there are typically long lines and few registers open. it's common to see managers at the front of the store and workers in audio-visual and other departments having a great time chatting with each other and ignoring customers. they hid the newspaper rack in the back of the self-checkout area, so it's unavailable to other customers (response was ""corporate made us do that.""). restocking is sporadic. some employees (grocery restocking, cart collection) do a good job, despite poor management."
2-star,0,"it is ok. the main problem is the workers. they are quite rude, the lines are always packed, and there is never enough registers open."
1-star,0,worst customer service at the service center. the person who was the manager was loud and obnoxious. all she keep saying was she didn't do the transaction so therefore she not helping us. what happen to trying to help out your customer?? she then proceed to another customer and ignore us
5-star,1,"i really don't understand the bad reviews. i love coming to this location. it's big in space, they have a huge variety of products."
1-star,0,"this place is always understaffed, on sunday they had less than half of their registers open and people wrapped around the walkways, making it difficult for other shoppers to get through."
1-star,0,"the worst walmart i've ever been to! the store is understaffed every time i'm there. i always have to wait in long lines at the registers. the employees are rude. the store is always messy. if you can, go somewhere else!"
2-star,0,"i am giving it two stars because non food items are fine. try to go buy everyday items, good luck! always out of stock. how can they not keep anything stocked? ammo selection is good but it's extremely hard to find person with key."
4-star,1,this location is huge!! and surprisingly everytime i come here i don't wait long to check out. i've actually been here looking around and a worker has voluntarily asked me if i needed any help. i've never been to any wal-mart that's ever done that!
2-star,0,"imho, the low prices are not worth the headache and aggravation of a few cash registers open and extremely poor customer service. hell, the time it takes to wait in line isn't worth the ""savings"". be careful when you go and sometimes it's better to park further away as to not have your car damaged by wayward shopping carts."
1-star,0,i agree with the other post. i have never seen so many people try to get out of working. they hide in different parts of the store to avoid doing their job. i am looking at 6 employees at customer service. only one is working. the others are all visiting with their friends.
1-star,0,"walmart pharmacy sucks. very poor customer service. they are not consistent with drug pricing. initially they said $32 for a drug i requested, when i went back in 4 days for the same drug they incremented it three fold to $94. very arrogant and bossy behavior by pharmacists. i guess walmart is failing because of its associates rude behavior, and customers are preferring other stores or buying online."
1-star,0,staff has absolutely no interest in helping you or greeting you. young man at subway is obnoxious. store is not clean. aisles are always filled with merchandise. worst of all the lines to make a return. girl who use to run the bakery was the only reason to go to the store.
1-star,0,"poorest customer service ever, the manager should be ashamed to have employees that treat customers as badly as this store incompetent and uneducated rif raf this store is never stocked never anyone to check you out no one will ever help you from the deli staff to the clerks"
4-star,1,this is hands down the only walmart i go to if possible. it's one of the newest ones in charlotte. always clean staff is always friendly and its walmart so the prices are always good. they have a pretty good garden center and the parking lot is huge so always plenty of parking. the traffic can be terrible to say the least so don't come in a hurry unless you live close by. there's also a subway inside and a gas station in the same parking lot.
3-star,0,i spoke with an associate before driving there. they had the item and she gave me great walking directions on how to find it from the home & garden entrance. the item was priced correctly. the store was clean and other associates were friendly.
1-star,0,this place is never stocked no matter what time or day you come here. the folks here and not helpful at all and the lay out of the store is horrible. if you forget your receipt for your groceries items that you want to return you have to walk all the way to the other side of the store and do an exchange and then walk all the way back to customer service and make the exchange there. complete waste of time and energy. i would rather go way out of my way to walmart in matthews than have to deal with this one one more time.
1-star,0,"well, it has everything walmart always has but with one added bonus. no easy exit, i go twice a month and you can never find a short checkout line, there are never enough cash registers open. outside of that you get what you should expect."
5-star,1,"i am in town from california visiting my brother and his family and one of my contacts ripped. i happen to be shopping at walmart and stopped by and spoke to the staff about my situation. they helped me right away and we're super friendly and got me new contacts within 10 minutes!!! thank you so much, my trip would have been ruined with out your help!"
4-star,1,i went into a new wal mart i was lost but the staff was helpful especially when i found a wallet with money in it. i gave it to a manager and she promptly took care of it.
1-star,0,"wow.....worst customer service ever..... made me spend 20 minutes on the phone trying to reach a different store who charged me the wrong price on a sale item.... told me they couldn't help me, and i would have to drive 30 minutes back in the other direction.... which often means they didn't want to....well turns out they can. but they made me jump through hoops for it. ""eldrina"" smirked at me and laughed.... seriously??? i am in a customer service job and i would never treat a client that way.....the assistant manager wad not quite as rude but was worthless.....janae thanks for being nice too me after their crap though. oh and now their computers are freezing....cool....i have been here 40 minutes!!! ugh i hate walmart even more than i thought i could."
5-star,1,"i'm not normally a walmart shopper, however this place is awesome. it has everything i need, groceries and small home supplies, all in one spot. i was able to get huge bottles of my expensive shampoo for half the price of a regular smaller bottle, and home fragrance sprays and waxes at fractions of the price of other places. the staff is friendly, the place is clean. if you need plants and gardening supplies, they have that as well. the only thing is that i would not go near the fresh meat section. some meats on the shelf looked way past their due date."
5-star,1,"i don't know why this walmart was rated low, this is one of the newer locations and one of my favorite walmarts around. i live in gastonia but shop here with my boyfriend because it's closer to his house and they carry the cat litter that i can never find at the walmart in belmont or gastonia. walmart is walmart but it's one of the better ones."
2-star,0,"this store continues to operate below typical wal-mart, and for that matter comparable big-box store, standards. despite being open a few years, they still fail to keep shelves stocked with staple items. and the outages are not temporary. i haven't seen wd-40 on the shelf once in the last 5 weeks; had to purchase at the arboretum store, which has always seemed better managed. there's still a shortage of open check-out lanes. one thursday morning there were no lanes open--correct, you were prohibited from buying anything because there was no one to ring it up. employees appear pretty despondent, especially compared to nearby wal-marts. overall, these symptoms speak to really shabby management. ps, 8% sales tax makes things more expensive than nc stores."
1-star,0,"i absolutely hate this walmart!!!! the only reason that i come here is to try to pick up an item here or there since it's on my way home from work. however, several times i've come out empty handed because they are miraculously sold out of what ever i wanted. the management here is horrible since they can't seem to keep their shelves properly stocked. who is in charge of ordering? it all boils down to the manager not running a tight ship. if this only happened occasionally, it would be one thing, but every time that i'm there? also, the service desk needs additional help. one time when i went to pick up an online ""ship to store"" item, just one clerk was working the returns desk - and he had a line. he told me to go to the photo area and someone would be there. so after waiting and waiting - i checked the print-out of my order confirmation, got the store phone number, and called the mgr from my cell phone - having seen his picture & name on a plaque on the wall. lucky for him, a clerk finally showed up before he answered. i will go to the store in indian trail, nc (1'st choice) or the arboretum at pineville-matthews & providence rds. (2'nd choice.) they seem to be managed much better, and rarely do they not have what i'm looking for. enter this walmart at your own risk - but understand that you have a big chance that whatever you went for is out of stock. read (and believe!) the others' reviews about this store not being properly stocked."
3-star,0,"full-size wal-mart that is a hair's breadth across the border into south carolina which means you save a few cents on your shop. it's brand new and it has the nice signage and the nice fixtures. it's a massive (i.e., normal) sized wal-mart so if you're shopping with folks, you'll want to plan where to meet up if you get separated. no, i'm not kidding! keep an eye out for the ""clearance"" aisle. every so often, something truly decent lands in there."
1-star,0,huge store. clean. it's a shame they can't keep their shelves stocked. they also have a very limited selection. i never find everything on my list when i go here. just a waste of time.
4-star,1,"this store is like a mini sam's club! i cant find anything and walk around and around, and end up finding things i didnt know i needed"
1-star,0,wallwallmart is falling by the wayside. all i wanted was a loaf of bread and some batteries. i got a workout trying to find both. there is something annoying about a store that is several football fields in size.
2-star,0,"kind of agree with s l. here... the store is nice and clean from being really new, but some of the items felt like it was lacking. this store is super clean and doubles as a grocery store (which is a good combination) when you want to buy food from somewhere. it's right on the border of sc so you get the benefit of sc taxes but just a less than 5 min drive to nc. i think i will stick to the walmarts that are closer to my house, so no more special trips out to this one unless i am in the area."
1-star,0,"this walmart store is lacking merchandise and good prices. however, don't even think about writing the store with your concerns because this is the reply you get: thank you for your inquiry regarding the price difference between individual walmart stores. each store is required to manage its own inventory; therefore, prices may vary from store to store. our store managers have the freedom to lower a price to clear out an overstock item, to reward customers with an in-store sale, or to compete with local merchants. walmart stores also do not match prices from sam's clubs or advertisements outside of the store's local trade territory or from other online sellers. for more information on our pricing policy, you may contact your local store management or visit our website at walmartstores.com and search ""price matching"". sincerely, walmart customer careless my original letter said: ----your original comments were---- walmart store #4237hello,this is regarding the walmart store above. i am a walmart shopper! in this economy who isn't, right? naturally, you can imagine how happy i was when a new superwalmart was going up within a few miles of my house (i had been driving 20 miles for my grocery shopping) in the past. however, i have to be honest--i am not too excited about the new store. they don't carry alot of the regular items i use; (regular comet--the 78 cent kind not $1.12 kind, black beans and rice, tiny bath and bedding section, just to name a few). also, if they have the item it costs more at this store, when their prices are close to ht's (fuse is $1.00 at all the other walmart's this store has it priced at $1.33 that is only .10 cents cheaper that ht). i also overheard a customer talking to the pharmcist and the customer was telling the pharmacist that their medication was more expensive at this store than at any other store. this is very disturbing for a new store, especially one that was so anticipated. i am finding myself making quick runs to ht now and because the walmart store i have been going to in matthews is starting to have a crime element i don't care to deal with, i am beginning to shop more and more at harris teeter again. i was very hopeful about this walmart store, however, i am not now."
1-star,0,worst walmart ever i had orientation there it just seem like you will never start.they wasting my time when i can be working else where
4-star,1,this walmart in particular was actually pretty clean. the staff was semi friendly and the produce quality was fairly similar to when i shop at harris teeter. i dropped a job of apple juice in the parking lot immediately after i'd purchased it. i walked in and explained what happened to the manager and he immediately brought me a new one
1-star,0,worst walmart ever. i was in line for 15 minutes to check out and then they told me and 6 other customers were out of luck. they're closed. what a joke. this place is just awful.
1-star,0,"i just hate this store. that is it. parking is a beast. the store always looks like a viking ship has invaded, pillaged and murdered most of their selection. there are always misbehaved children running around the store, not paying attention to other shoppers. the lines are always long. never enough employees. the employees that are there always look unhappy and just sour to be there. the last 3 times we went to the store (before never going again) the fire alarms were pulled and they closed the store. there are always cops around. they search your cart when you are about to leave - which really ticks me off because we only go to walmart once a week and we usually spend upwards of $200 dollars. please go treat someone else like a thief, not the person that just shelled out a whole boat load of money in your store. way to treat the customers that actually help sustain your crappy business. i absolutely hate that no one in this store speaks any type of english. i always feel like i am shopping on a strange planet where no one understands me or makes an effort to understand me. the amts of times that i get held up in a line with someone with an ebt card that doesnt speak english just stresses me out. customer service may as well have pulled an elvis and left the building because this location is hell on earth. we have not been to this store in a few months... we kind of dropped off the walmart boat but if we do go, we go to the one in matthews near sardis. at least its not dangerous. if you can help yourself: stay away."
1-star,0,"rudeness reigns supreme at this place. yeah, i know, walmart isn't exactly the place to go if you want excellent customer service. but wow; very few times in life have i ever been cursed at by a cashier; and the manager simply didn't care. so, i went elsewhere to buy my $200 purchase that day. i won't be going back to this location; i suggest you do the same."
1-star,0,i've never seen a walmart that closes. they've always been 24 hours anywhere i've been. we just got turned away at the door at 11:59 pm. guess this is a really bad part of town if wm closes...?
1-star,0,"many extremely rude cashiers. there are a few that are nice so kudos to them since negativity is contagious. however, still some of the worst attitudes ive seen and i honestly don't understand how they keep their jobs. store is always messy but i guess thats par for the course of a walmart."
4-star,1,"with the never ending construction on independence blvd it is difficult to get here sometimes. huge store - has good grocery section, nice floral selection and lots and lots of the other stuff that you find at walmart. employees are useful, helpful and friendly. lots of toys and pretty nice gardening center."
1-star,0,"simply, it's a piece of shit ! i've visited a lot of walmart stores around the states but this one is the worst business place i've ever been. sorry for my language, hope you get actual image of the place ."
1-star,0,"zero stars for customer service. i spent much un-needed time in this store because the employees are unwilling to assist with helping me find what i needed. (i asked three people who were stocking shelves, you think they'd be able to help) then after being charged twice for an item, i went to customer service and wasn't even acknowledged. the three employees that were there talked amongst themselves about being denied for food stamps & how to reapply. not only did they not speak to me, they didn't even make eye contact and handed me cash back without asking if i wanted it back on my card. i can't believe adults could be so rude and incompetent and still have a job! i would be fired at my job on the spot if i treated anyone the way they treat me. absolutely ridiculous."
1-star,0,this store is always very dirty and messy the aisles are always strewn with trash and the floor is dirty. don't go there. when i need to go to walmart i go to the one off wilkinson and ashley
1-star,0,"slowest place on earth, i am so glad they gave raises to employees who do not care about actually helping people. if i was this bad at my job i would expect to be fired. horrible, the cashier just let someone jump line because her friend had already checked out bullshit"
2-star,0,"i thought i was gonna be the only one giving them a crap score but i see it's not just me that hates this place. guess it's a club. i only go here for 2, sometimes 3 things...toilet paper, cat litter, and cat flea meds ( a couple times a year). i try to avoid coming here so much that if i don't need both items i try to figure out a way to stretch what i have at home until i do. it's such a hassle. first off you have to park practically a mile a way everytime ( and i do not go on weekends) then the things i need are at the further point from the door in the store. the last handful of times i have gone they haven't restocked anything so they have nothing i need except tp. pointless trip and then forget trying to talk to an employee ""does anyone work here?!"" comes to mind. additionally the other reviews have pretty much nailed it, the added element of fear from the excessive amount of cops, how it takes 20 minutes to buy 2 things at 10 pm on a tuesday, and avoid the produce. in fact just avoid this place completely if you can. 2 stars for convenience and cleanliness but i'm just glad i found a different litter brand ( forced to after coming here three times in a row and them not having it on the shelves) i prefer at pet smart so i never have to step foot in here again."
1-star,0,"big dumb pile of bricks. same stupid walmart just as it was on eastway drive. now its just new and cleaner soon to be dirty. very ratchet unorganized store. it's so bad that it rubs off on the customers and they start acting crazy. we to return some moldy grapes once and at 1st they denied me. i requested a member of management and after waiting about 10mins tops she comes out just as rude and as nasty as ever. she than feels up the new grapes i got and has the nerve to say ""they feel the same to me"" like wtf? you can't feel mood ma'am. never again! not if this was the last walmart in charlotte, i'd drive to another city to avoid this one."

1-star,0,"i visited walmart with my pimp today, and it was the worst experience i've ever had. there was actual human feces on the bathroom floor. there were crying children and adults at every corner. i couldn't even find the blood on the dancefloor cd i was looking for. would not recommend."
5-star,1,"5 stars for a walmart, wha the wha?! i know but seriously everything was spot on perfect. i am really more of a target type but i was hunting cheap wine glasses which target doesn't have. access was easy right off independence (must be a new thing cause i read all the reviews about access issues). parking lot was clean and not littered with carts. store was also super clean and staff was uber nice. cashier was really helpful in trying to get my conditioner to ring up, should have got her name. produce was super fresh and loads of it. can't say enough, just a really great experience. up yours walmart on wilkinson."
1-star,0,"walmart fail! i despise this store....but it was the only place open after i got off work. i was really in need of a space heater so my exposed pipes at the house wouldnt freeze. i go in with mission to only get the space heater. of course, you always end up getting $100 worth of other stuff you pass and realize you need too. so my cart is half full...and i head off to find the heater. i asked a store employee who was really nice and actually walked across the store to show me where they would be located. of course, they were completely out...in the dead of winter. seems to me like they would keep something like that stocked up. as i was headed up to the front to check out...i stepped away from my buggy and left it unattended while i checked something out the next aisle over. while i was away...a buggy theif totally took all my merchandise out of the cart, left it on the floor and took the buggy with them! who does that? i mean damn! i was actually kinda thankful, when i saw that they had 3 checkout lines of the 30 checkouts open....the lines were backed up like a clogged sewer pipe. i was over it....so i began to walk out. when i got to the exit with my phone, wallet and keys in hand....the ""greeter"" who looked like she was off an episode of ""faces with meth"" body checked me up and down and looked at me like i was walking out with concealed inventory. way to make someone feel welcome in wally world. the parking lot is confusing as hell.....in fact, trying to find your way out makes you feel like you are stuck in hell. now i remember why i dont go to walmart"
1-star,0,"whoever hired jazzman and rodney to be managers, made a terrible mistake. they are both terrible role managers. it's no wonder why the employees are uneducated and rude like they are. it was my first visit to this store and with the horrible service that i received from jazzman, i don't intend on shopping there again. it's apparent that neither jazzman nor rodney care about the service they give to customers."
1-star,0,"this post is about the subway in this walmart. i had the craziest subway experience ever at this walmart. first, the woman working had to run answer the phone which was no big deal since i wasn't in a rush, but then started cleaning after and left us standing there, while her co-worker took care of all the people in line behind us. once we made eye contact she realized she'd left us standing there and came over to finish our order. then, she asked us the same questions about the bread, cheese, toasting, and sub choice over and over again. finally we get to deal with someone else when it comes time to put our toppings on, but little did we know that all of the workers were not properly trained. she loaded my sub so full that it was barely edible, and the sub was so drenched in oil and vinegar that i could smell it the whole way home-- through the bag! haha i actually was laughing the whole time and couldn't believe how out of whack this place was but hey, it's walmart. p.s. if the guy in front of us reads this, i hope you didn't eat all that mayo!"
2-star,0,"i am like hailey and i rarely shop at walmart but on this particular instance i was looking for something specific like a tea ball and harris teeter and target didn't have one. so at 7pm on a sunday i thought of what else might be open that was somewhat close and i ended up here. first off, accessing this walmart is awkward. there's an entrance off of pierson rd and one off of independence and that's it. getting back to independence is even more of a challenge when you actually have to go behind the old varnador building. anyway, the best thing i can say about walmart is that when they are forced to, the stores actually blend into the neighborhood pretty well. now if they can do something about the ginormous parking lots they need. inside the store, it's typical of a walmart. junky products, hard to find what you are looking for and the typical inconsiderate walmart shoppers. it took me a while but i found what i was looking for and i got out of the store vowing never to come back. the tea ball was junky. should have paid for the $12 one at teavana. it wouldn't have broke after first use..."
2-star,0,"walmart doesn't change much from one location to the next, and that is really part of their appeal, such as it is. this location really isn't much different in that regard. where this location really falls down is the parking lot. rather, leaving the parking lot. getting into the lot is not difficult. getting out is a nightmare. you can either leave by independence and risk life and limb (and car), or you can exit by residential street, and end up getting on independence in another direction, or wind your way through other residential areas and end up who knows where. there is, quite frankly, no way to get going in the correct direction if you want to end up headed in at least one particular direction. you cannot completely fault walmart for this - it is like they took some cues from casino designers here, and the city let them. they really need to close off the outbound exit direct to independence and create a way to get onto albemarle to make it really accessible. in the meantime. there are other locations that are way more convenient."
2-star,0,black friday was a absolute mess and this walmart was even more terrible!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! unorganized and everything!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i was really disappointed with this walmart!!!!!!!!!!! the tv lines were in areas that prevented people from shopping in the store............all the products were in the aisles so if you had a push buggy then you were not very mobile.....
3-star,0,"we got dried apricots, cherries and a nestles crunch bar. they open 6 am and close at midnight so luis had to drive to the walmart on galleria to buy the fan after midnight:("
3-star,0,"i'm not a regular walmart shopper, but on occasion i know they have what i need and so to walmart i go. for this location, yes, you turn right off independence into the parking lot (going east). i found a close parking spot in no time, entered and was pleasantly surprised by the cleanliness (how long will this last? only time will tell), knew the general section my item was in and found the section immediately, a few aisles later found my items, walked to express check out, had a nice chat with the woman behind me in line, paid, and out in under 10 minutes. for me, that's success at a walmart. had the stars aligned for me that day? maybe. but when i only shop at walmart a few times a year, i'll take it. all the aisles i passed had fully stocky shelves, employees actually had smiles on their faces, this is a nice step up from the one i used to visit on wilkinson. if you need to go back west on independence, there is a parking lot exit on pierson that loops you back around (with plenty of signs to direct you)."
2-star,0,"i mean, its a wal-mart ya'll. the only thing different with this location is the pain getting back onto independence, i can not imagine all of the brilliant car accidents that will occur with people trying to leave."
2-star,0,"oh! new walmart! i came here to pick up a few items, and wow was it hard to get in and out of this place. it's right next to independence which makes it kind of scary getting out and turning right. this walmart is brand new and it's not bad, but i've seen better especially the way the store was built and entering and exiting the store. since they closed the eastway location (which is really good because that store was super old) this is the substitute location for everyone. i didn't enjoy the stone floors when you first walk in, i saw it was a problem because it was raining when i walked in and it was slippery. they do need to put in some carpets in there. this layout of walmart is like the one in university, so if you know that store than you will be a pro in finding things at this one."
2-star,0,"""did you hear/see they are opening a new walmart over on independance?"".....why yes, yes i did hear/see that and i still have no idea why such events are noteworthy. i'm guessing it's because so many people drive by there everyday on their way in or out of the city on 74 it's just eye catching. anyways, i went to the latest and greatest addition to charlottes big box chain stores the other day for some random item a friend wanted to pick up and as always, when you are shopping for random items, where do you head? walmart.. that's where. the first thing i noticed about this one is the effacement on the building itself seems to be a little different than their other ones. it's brick, a little more pronounced and almost looks like they have redesigned it entirely to try and update the structure and make it look not so much walmart-y as the standard blue and gray of the past. the inside, is just like every other walmart supercenter (clothes, groceries, etc) i've ever been in except with the added bonus of being brand it doesn't have the entirely funky old musty smell to it, just yet. i bought some groceries, my friend bought his random item of the week and we headed on out merry way. one thing that was kinda a pain in the ass about this particular store is the location isn't easy to get into and out of. we actually had to drive through a neighborhood to get there and then through another neighborhood to get back out. we probably didn't take the best route but when you are making a trip to a store that has the amazing effect of making you want to get there as fast as possible and then get the hell away as fast as possible, wrong turns can be made. the cashier lady who checked us out took about 5 minutes to ring up a clove of garlic that the guy in front of us had and actually had to first try and get a manager to help her and then pulled in another cashier who was able to score a assist and move us all along. i'm more and more becoming a fan of amazon.com for shopping for a lot random items walmart tends to carry. if you really, really, feel the need to check this one out ""the new walmart over on independance"" then go, breath in deeply of not only the people of walmart but also all that one of the good old icons of american consumerism has to offer. otherwise, you may just want to hit a target instead."
4-star,1,"this walmart is pretty good compared to some that i've been in. i typically use the self checkout, which saves me time. i don't usually grocery shop here, but i might start because it is only 12 minutes away from home. the concerns i have are that they don't carry goya products, which we consume regularly. they also don't carry the low-sodium great value potato and tortilla chips. they have most of the other items that i've grown accustomed to at my previous walmarts, however. the store is clean and i haven't noticed merchandise laying in the aisles, which is a plus, and probably a fire hazard. interestingly, there are two electric car chargers in the parking lot. granted, i haven't seen anyone using them, but it's a cool feature. i've tried to use the auto center, but that place is jam packed, even at 8 am on weekends. i'm trying to decide if this or the wadsworth location will be my go-to walmart. i've been grocery shopping at the wadsworth location, which also doesn't carry goya and low-sodium great value stuff. because this location is slightly closer to home, i may go here for groceries. decisions, decisions."
4-star,1,walmart is walmart. what you see is what you get. the store was relatively clean. the staff was no where to be found besides the check out area. not much else to say besides it's walmart.
1-star,0,"not surprised by all of these one star reviews. me and my friend were just casually shopping with our shopping cart and okay yes, that cart might have been a shopping cart intended for an infant but like who can judge us for that???? we typically only shop for tiny things? so we're walking through the toy aisle, keeping it very classy, when this walmart employee comes strolling along on her high horse with the attitude of the princess of wales. we politely told her hi and moved our tiny shopping cart out of the way, she rudely says nothing back until we decide that perhaps our cart of choice is maybe not large enough to suit our needs. when my friends goes to return the cart herself out of the goodness in her pure heart, queen sassy employee says very nastily, ""i'll put it away"". i'm furious about our treatment and demand her resignation. do the right thing, walmart"
1-star,0,"from damage items to not so great store not one employee smiled or enjoyed there job. the staff was demoing carrots and hidden valley ranch to much ranch for only two carrots. oh the lot attendants especially the one that wears the hat that has facial hair well he needs to change out his safety vest. your walmart greeter just stood there at the door never smiled welcoming people to walmart his opening could of been jeff dunham favorite line "" welcome to walmart get your shit and get out."" the question remains is the customers running the store or is the employees or management running the customers. i also later learn that most employees when you ask for help from the door greeters they wont do anything."
4-star,1,"always seems weird to give walmart more than 2 stars on anything because, well, they usually suck...but..for all the sucky walmart stores out there, there has to be a few good ones. this one just happens to be a pretty good one, with a fairly easy way to enter and exit the parking lot and an abundance of workers to assist in and outside of their designated departments; this place actually makes shopping pretty simple. i always enter through the garden center as it opens into the cosmetics and personal items section, to my surprise there is always a cashier in the garden section so that you can check out at the back of the store. most departments are pretty well organized, with the occasional cluster of mess here or there. the grocery section is laid out pretty nice and in correct fashion for food shopping, hot food right by the door to lure you in with smells and warmth especially now since it is cold. an additional section of pastries and baked goods mixed in with produce from there and then down the line of dried goods, canned goods, drinks, frozen food and refrigerated items. i always go to scope out the collectible cards and figures since that area usually has closed registers and is somewhat abandoned no matter the hour. i have yet to buy a double blind box or collector card box so that is a bit of a testament in some way. biggest tip: forget the lines no matter how many items you have and coupons? don't worry! just use the self check out area, there is always an attendant to be flagged down and coupons scan with no issue. even those buy 2 get one free coupons, just scan it at the end and boom instant savings removed based on the cost of your highest item (up to listed price on coupons). so, overall not a terrible walmart location to shop. good layout, acceptable collectibles selection and self check outs that make life a breeze."
1-star,0,"the recent media story regarding their toys for tots drive (obviously the vast majority of the donated toys collected outside their store, are likely purchased directly from inside), makes me angry. we just bought a $10 toy from our local ga walmart, for this same cause 3 days ago, and now i regret spending our money to support a corporation, who obviously doesn't support their community, the armed services, or our country. it's a disgrace. that's my 2 cents..."
1-star,0,"medina, oh (woio) - it's become a social media firestorm. for nearly 15 years, former active duty marine john harkness said he's been allowed by the medina walmart to stand inside and collect toys and money for toys for tots, but this week there was a change. ""they made us stay outside,"" said harkness. ""we're there to collect toys for children that need a christmas."" naturally when shopper mary murdock saw him standing in the cold while she was shopping, she was outraged. ""i just said, why can't they put you inside? this is crap,"" said murdock. walmart told us ""it's policy."" of course, it's their right to have such policies. a spokesperson issued this statement: ""walmart's corporate policy across our more than 4500 stores does not allow this type of solicitation inside our stores and we apologize for any confusion about this policy."" the spokesperson said the current store manager is new this year and that if the marines were allowed inside in years past, that actually broke the rules. but it doesn't make harkness or the many viewers any more satisfied. ""it takes two seconds to do the right thing when it's cold and rainy and holiday season. you can put them in there,"" said murdock. walmart furthered the statement with this: ""if a marine or anyone was treated with disrespect, that is unacceptable and we are looking into this matter further to get the facts."" while john harkness waits for an apology and is hopeful for the change, he is thankful for all the support. strangers bringing him coffee, sandwiches, or even just offering their support. ""it's encouraging. it's fantastic. it's good to have the general public, vets and non-vets support you,"" said harkness."
1-star,0,they are very disrespectful having a marine stand in the cold & rain collecting toys for tots... the manager needs to be fired!
1-star,0,"ugh. the thought of entering this walmart makes my gag reflex get a little jumpy. when i use to go it was because i needed something that target didn't carry, that doesn't happen any more. this store is filled with screaming children, dishoveled aisles and just yucky people and items in general. no thank you."
5-star,1,"i travel a lot, and have been to way too many walmarts just for little things like sunscreen or cereal. walmart is always there. anyway, this is by far the nicest one i've been to. i've been here two or three times, and two of those times i also went to the pharmacy. i've always gotten good service. store is above average cleanliness. prices are good obviously. even parking isn't bad compared to many walmart stores i've been to. i wish all walmart stores were this way, then the place wouldn't have such a bad rap."
2-star,0,"one experience, about 4-5 years ago, will never be forgotten from my memory until i leave this place we call earth. on this particular visit, i simply went in to purchase a pair of cheap tennis rackets. after checking out, for some reason, i decided to glance at my receipt. for two identical tennis rackets i was charged $12 and some change and the other was roughly $2 cheaper. usually i let things like this go, but i was determined to get my 2 hard-earned dollars back. so i walk to the returns desk and explain the situation to the returns associate which responded with an open mouth and deer-in-headlights stare. after establishing some form of primitive communication with this poor lost soul, she paged a manager which covered the sporting merchandise. after waiting 5 minutes for this manager i grew very impatient, and began regretting my decision to get charged the correct amount. the manager finally arrived and i explained the situation. instead of just doing the right thing and selling me the $12 racket for the cheaper one's price, i waited an additional 5 minutes for her to go to sporting goods to play detective and walk all the way back to returns. she finally arrived back and dropped the hardest retail bombshell on me. she tells the returns girl,""the one racket was priced incorrectly, they are both $12 and charge him $2 more for the cheaper mis-tagged racket"". after waiting 10+ minutes to get a measly $2 back i'm being told to return what i purchased and be re-rung to pay $2 more for what they priced incorrectly!! i flipped out and explained what complete b.s. this was. all the while the customers behind me were routing me on. after all of that time wasted, i was told that i could keep the rackets for the prices i originally bought them. instead of taking the ordeal any further, i took the high road and left walmart the second time the same way as i left it the first...$2 poorer."
2-star,0,"walmart what can you expect? well i think we should expect better! i went in to get a cell phone and stood in front of a ""sales person"" for about 5 minutes before they even acknowledged my prescience. even with cheaper prices its almost not worth it. dont you think they could get a person who has a slight bit of knowledge of cell phones to sell them? guess were asking to much."
1-star,0,"vision center review ... after shopping around and comparing prices at different stores i decided to purchase lenses for my current frames at walmart. while comparing prices i was told at walmart that they could put the medium weight lenses in my frames for $60 with a $10 fee for doing so. so i returned a few days later and the associate that helped me this time told me i could not put lenses in my frame because whoever fitted the lenses to the frame bent the frame and it would probably break. (they were from walmart by the way) so instead i purchased some cheap frames and what i thought was the medium weight lenses. i have extremely bad eye sight and most companies will not sell me the thickest lenses because i would not be able to see correctly with them and they would be very heavy and not fit in most frames. so i return two weeks later to pick up my new glasses and i have the heaviest thickest lenses in my new wire rim frames! i use to work at an eye doctor selling frames; thick lenses will not stay in wire rim frames! i told this sales associate that this is not what i ordered, i wanted to purchase the medium weight lenses, and that the other associates told me they were $60, she told me they were not they were $140, well before i was told the thinnest lenses were $140. instead of correcting the order, having me pay the difference, and sending my glasses back to get them fixed she argues with me until i just give up and tell her to return them. i am not taking glasses that i would not be able to see out of, or that are going to break just because she cannot understand that the other sales associate filled out the form incorrectly and was too busy answering phones and talking about cat's to get my order correct. my boyfriend was with me when i purchased the glasses and he confirmed that he thought i was ordering the medium weight lenses as well, the problem was this woman did not know what she was selling or how to place an order. now my eye glass prescription is expired and i have no glasses. i have been getting glasses for 23 years and this is the only time in my life this has happened to me. worst experience i have ever had! never go to the vision center in medina go to strongsville or something instead!"
1-star,0,my wife bought a swimwear just under two weeks ago (and decided she wasn't happy with her choice). the policy in this store said 'no returns'. not one mention of 'no exchanges' on an unused swim suit. she tried to exchange her 95 dollar untouched swimsuit and was flat out rejected. untouched. tags on! all in the name of 'health concerns '. interesting that other more 'reputable' stores don't have the same policy. terrible policy and terrible store. if you buy it you better like it because you are 'out of luck' otherwise. save your money and spend it elsewhere. many options out there who will provide a more common sense policy.
5-star,1,"oh my gosh, i am in love!!! i cannot believe they have been around for 20 years and i never knew about them! trying on swimwear is a nightmare most of the time especially when you are not a size 2 and 25 but these ladies are so helpful and their suits are for all ages and all body types! usually, when shopping the mall i maybe can find 1 suit that sorta fits i had to choose from 5 suits that were amazing! their prices are very reasonable for the quality for sure. besides swimsuits, they have cute beach clothes and the best part they are not seasonal they have a great selection all year long!"
2-star,0,"i was disappointed with this store. there was a wide variety of bathing suites but they were all targeted to the older women. being in my 20's i wanted a bathing suite top that was cute unique and stylish... i didn't like any to actually buy it. lastly i thought these bathing suites were over priced. they employees were all very nice and tried helping me find what i was looking for, it just wasn't the store for me."
1-star,0,"not impressed. overpriced and most of their inventory is for someone older. sales people were nice, however pricey considering each separate was over $60."
5-star,1,"loved this place! huge selection, no pressure, kind and patient women helped me find two bikinis that fit well after my recent weight loss. i went to many stores and was unable to find a single suit that fit well. here, i found multiple suits that fit me well and looked great!"
4-star,1,"i stopped in here today on a whim. i am headed on a girls trip to the lake and thought a new swimsuit would be nice. the shop was easy to find and packed full of merchandise. i was immediately greeted when i walked in the door and asked how they could help. i explained the style of suit i was looking for and she took me right over to the style and size needed. with about six swimsuits (one and two piece) in my hands i headed for the fitting rooms. they checked on a me a couple of times and brought me an alternate size for one of the suites. i ended up selecting the very first suite she showed me after explaining what i wanted. i took my suit home and my husband loved it. i have to say the suit was on the expensive side...never have paid that much for a suit. however, being a local business i didn't mind dropping a little more knowing a majority of the money will stay in the community."
1-star,0,"i went there to get a bathing suit for physical therapy and for summer. im a busty girl... it runs in the family, and this makes finding a cute but supportive bathing suit hard! i was told by a few people that they had a nice selection and cute suits here so i figured id stop in and take a look. upon being greeted, i explained my situation and what i was looking for, and the sales person looked at me like i was an idiot for having big boobs or something... its not like i had bought the suckers, and even if i had, that would be my choice and none of their business! she was kind of rude from start to finish. explaining that for my bust size, but small waist, that the only suits they had to offer were pretty matronly.... im 25.... not really wanting to look like a grandma. to say the least, after the comment about me spilling out of the last suit she suggested for me (knowing my size), i left. horrible customer service =("

5-star,1,"looking for a swimsuit or resort clothes? hate trying on bathing suits? this store is for you! even if you are a size 2 and love trying our suits this store is still for you! i am a very hard to fit swimsuit person as the top is much bigger than the bottom in terms of size and i found 7 bathing suits that fit me perfectly! elise is amazing and they will even custom make a suit for you at a reasonable price! i will never buy another suit in arizona at dillards, macy's target or anywhere else. in 45 minutes i had the best selection, customer service, friendly help and i never once felt like i could have found better styles or prices. do yourself a favor....go get your swim and resort wear at what women want swimwear..and you will be thanking me for writing this post!!!"
5-star,1,"i cannot believe i actually enjoyed picking out not just one, but two wonderful swimsuits. i am tall and large on top, so picking out swimsuits has always been an issue for me. after spending last week in dillard's, looking at overpriced suits with only 1 fitting me (on top), i was shocked to find this store where i spent my lunch break trying on at least 10 suits that were made for me (i am sure there was more, but i stopped looking). the price is good and the service was wonderful. there was another customer in the store and the service provided to the two of us was very helpful. the lady knew her stuff (not the owner) and she was honest about how the suit fit on me."
5-star,1,"this store looks like one of those thrift stores from the outside but it takes seconds before you realise that they have an exquisite collection. my mom-in-law stays away from dark coloured garments because she is dark-skinned herself. banning 'dark' makes it even more difficult for us to find appropriate swimwear in stores that revel in gloomy spandex. after rummaging through the over-priced tacky swim suits at nordstrom and macy's i breathed a sigh of relief at wwws. the lady in the store, probably the owner, assisted us as soon as we stepped in. after assessing our requirements she directed us to the right racks. my mom-in-law pulled out atleast 10 good ones in her size and fit. we walked out with a fabulous swimsuit is olive green and red."
4-star,1,"i never realized just how hard it was to shop for a bathing suit. since i am not of t ypical size (i refuse to go into more in this review about that), i can't go to a typical store (everything but water, macy's...wherever) to find a bathing suit that fits. after going to many stores on saturday and experiencing lyrca burn everywhere on my body...i decided to check out this store. while i feel that the customer service had a little bit to be desired, they had a wonderful selection of suits that fit any woman of any size. the bikinis had a mix of sizes...and it just wasn't the typical small - large...they went by bra sizes all the way up to size g...they cater to everybody. that alone makes it a wonderful experience. while the type of bathing i was looking for was not a speciality of theirs (speedo - and they did carry a few), i found a suit that fit and didn't make me look like a scary slob. also, the prices were spot on...i didn't have to pay a fortune to look good. i give it 3.5 stars....selection was great...but they lost some on the customer service. (nice ladies...but they weren't very knowledgeable and when i walked out with the bathing suit on, they didn't say anything to me. but when i walked out with my clothes on...they asked me what i thought...a little late, i may say)"
5-star,1,had such an amazing experience here. ashley was super helpful. she helps out with style and looks. great prices and amazing clothing.
1-star,0,i was determined to buy jeans there as i have 2 friends that rave about how soft their jeans are. i walk in and both older ladies are behind the counter and there is one other person in the entire store. they don't even notice me and my 2 kids. i grab a bunch of jeans and head to the back and try them all on. i need diff sizes but no one even acknowledges me. i am done and walk out and notice one lady is now gone and there is only one other lady at the register so i just walk out empty handed. how is this store still open? they clearly aren't selling anything and there isn't any help what so ever. customer service is clearly an unknown term here! don't bother going to this location.
1-star,0,"unfortunately my experiences mirror all the previous posts. i have been shopping here a couple years now. i own a law firm. if i go in after work the staff is friendly and can't help fast enough. if i go in dressed down i am wholly and rudely ignored, every time. i have complained a few times. nothing changes. i'll be contacting corporate next. i shouldn't have to be in a suit to be treated with professionalism and respect. it is 100% true you are greeted and helped or not based on your appearance and the day. it is never consistent and i am exhausted dealing with the never-ending flippant attitude and lack of regard for common courtesy and decency."
1-star,0,i will be honest and say that this place is highly unprofessional. certain subjects of matter were discussed on the floor in front of customers and calling out workers on the floor is disrespectful. workers do not know how to dress professional for the position. i was told that i just didn't show up for work when i called in twice and had proof on my phone bill. i left my position there because of hours not working well with my college schedule and getting low hours and how unprofessional the entirety of the situation of working there with the managers and other workers. not a friendly environment.
2-star,0,"i completely agree with carrie. i was in this store at the tanger outlets today having been to their other location at the biltmore and was very displeased. no one greeted me, asked if i needed help, if i needed to try on or anything! i might have well been invisible. originally i thought it was because i am a younger consumer and often associates don't think we are there to spend but i was prepared to buy! i bought one shirt but might have bought more had i not been eager to leave because of the lack of customer service. most of the women working looked older like it was just a part time job to be out of the house. either way i was not pleased. however, the biltmore location was a completely satisfying experience and i didn't even buy anything that day. the girls were extremely friendly and made conversation outside of what i was shopping for. so if you wish to shop this retailer i advise that location is best."
1-star,0,"i love the clothes. but, i love the clothes at other places that will take a minute to say hello and find out if i need any assistance. or eye contact instead of eyes rolled at me. this is the second time i have been in this whbm and the customer service is the same. i got none. 5 other people walked in while i was there and each one of them received a greeting and 4 out of 5 even got conversation from the ladies that were working. i stood by a rack and watched, waiting, hoping someone working there would help me. the ladies working this particular day had a wonderful way of making me feel like i was in the wrong place and that my money should be spent elsewhere. so i did. never again ladies. your attitudes need serious work."
1-star,0,"worst service i've ever received at white house black market stores across the country. ""suzy"" and ""cory"" gave me an attitude because i wanted to exchange 3 articles of clothes that i purchased at full price in feb. i didn't want my money back or even the difference all i wanted was a smaller size since i recently had a baby and lost some weight. i checked the receipt before driving 40 minutes to the outlet and it did not say anything about exchanges only about returns. as a black book member i've spent thousands of dollars at the other whbm locations. never again will i shop at any of these stores. if i wanted to be treated like my $ didn't matter then i would have gone to the local mall. poor cashier lena was so nervous and embarrassed it took her almost 30 minutes to process a simple size exchange. don't waste your time or money here. better service at the other outlets."
5-star,1,"obsessed! higher end, unique, hippy dippy, fun and free spirited. this is the perfect store for anyone who likes boho/hippie styled clothing; specializing in leather goods, clothing with fringe, beading, sequins and shoes galore. you can find great gifts here (candles, jewelry, home decor, miscellaneous etc.). david, the owner, is fun and welcoming. he and his staff provide excellent, guest friendly service."
4-star,1,"winds of change is a surprisingly charming boutique in chagrin falls. the exterior catches your eye immediately. the pink shutters are distinctly inviting on the small cottage style house, so you certainly won't miss it. i love how they have their interior decorated. it's pretty visually overwhelming--nearly every corner is packed with clothing or accessories. but it has this whimsical, pixie bohemian feel (did i just make that up?) that gives off really good vibes. i can't argue that they have an interesting jewelry collection and some really charming small gifts. it's a great place to pick up a small gift for your stylish girlfriend. the brands in the store are mixed and pricier. many of the brands run very small, so sometimes an ""l"" looks more like a s/m. that's a bit disappointing, though its pretty standard at these higher-priced boutiques. i would give it 5 stars if it had more diverse sizes. the clothing is definitely geared towards younger gals, but the place is super cute nonetheless."
5-star,1,"i've walked into winds of change a few times in the past and have always been blown away by the unique clothing, shoes, and accessories. i popped by the store yesterday but this time in need of something different...a few items that would look good on my pregnant belly! the sweet girl that was working was of great assistant and led me to just what i've been looking for. i couldn't have had more of a pleasant experience. i left a very happy lady. :)"
5-star,1,this is the only place i shop! it is the best store! everyone at woc makes the experience life changing. the store is magical and your whole life will be transformed when you shop there. angela and her angels will make you feel like a goddess / princess. the store is one of the most unique places in oh.
5-star,1,"i've been to the location in hudson a few times and it is such a beautiful store. the owners, angela and david, are very friendly and fashion forward. for a high end boutique, the sales associates --namely carlyn-- are willing to help without being pushy. they all seem genuinely interested in what you want. i would recommend this store to anyone with a passion for fashion."
5-star,1,"really sweet clothing and accessory boutique in the heart of chagrin falls. this place has some of the coolest, most unique rings, necklaces and earrings i have ever seen. and reasonably priced too. some items are made by local artists and designers. as far as clothing, there are some really high-end one-of-a-kind pieces as well as affordable items. something for everyone. the staff is friendly and they will individually assist you in choosing the perfect outfit. woc can also be found on coventry."
1-star,0,"posting this review based on this specific worker, adrienne. i was ready to check out but she made sure to finish her conversation with her coworker before acknowledging me. didn't say one weird to me other than to tell me my total. when she finished bagging my stuff, she actually shoved the bag at me. awful attitude."
5-star,1,"evelyn was incredible! my sister found a dress a couple weeks ago, but when we came back to the store today she could not find it. she was very upset. evelyn stepped in right away! my sister described the dress to her and evelyn was able to find it online and even got us free shipping. it was a great experience and we definitely felt like she cared. thank you!"
5-star,1,"i have nothing but great things to say about the ladies that work in this store! i am a frequent shopper of this establishment and every time i shop here they always make sure i get the best experience possible. they go above and beyond to help me with my needs. adrienne recently has helped me pick out outfits for going out of town and she nailed it! also, nicki helped me in the dressing room with ruling out options. so nice to know that customer service is still a priority here."
5-star,1,this is my favorite store! i always come here when i need a dress for an event. i recently came in to look for a dress to wear at a wedding. i had something really specific in mind and adrienne was able to pick out a dress that was exactly what i was looking for!
5-star,1,"as we are frequent shoppers of arrowhead mall. many stores lack great employees willing to make your shopping experience joyful and go above and beyond! my lady and i found that joyful shopping experience at this store today! blocking out the rest of our shopping experiences with other stores in the mall that lack such good customer service. we would like to thank store manager evelyn for everything she did to help my lady with several fashion choices! we can see evelyn going far in this company and one day moving up. you are a great asset to wf ma'am, thank you... from your, forever customers!"
5-star,1,i enjoy shopping at this store and frequent here often. i am always greeted and the customer service is great. they are imaginative with their clothes and accessories combo's and help me think outside of the box.
5-star,1,"this is my all time favorite location! i've been shopping here for about 10 years and every time i walk out i'm extremely satisfied. all of the workers are great, especially evelyn! she always helps me finding what i want and has the best service ever! i recently moved to chandler and will still make the drive to arrowhead location!"
4-star,1,"this is the high-end place, where a girl can find a dress for the ball and shoes to match. you wont find any low quality junk here; this is the prom/social event/faux wedding stuff, with sequins and tulle and lace galore. if i ever get married, i'll come look here before i ever hit the bridal shops. this is where the girls go before they hit the big chain dress departments. it makes sense, since the merchandise is all packed in close."
5-star,1,"love this store! the ladies in here are definitely helpful and give honest opinions about dresses. it's not only about the sales but honesty. ashley, sabrina and veronica are awesome ! 10/10 i recommend !"
3-star,0,"i have stopped by a few times recently with my sister to shop for prom dresses. i have to say, it's as any other store is but for the most part always disorganized. the staff is typically friendly when checking out. however, the cleanliness of this store is unacceptable. the dressing rooms floors and baseboards looked as though they hadn't been maintained in weeks. it's not a comfortable place to set your bag down let alone walk around barefoot and what not."
5-star,1,"i went looking for a prom dress and walked into the store already thinking it was a failed mission and that i would find nothing. the selection was amazing and although i did not leave with a dress, it was because of my own indecisiveness, not for lack of options. they have styles in all price ranges and i was very impressed by the helpful staff and modern styles."
5-star,1,"fairly like any other store. as i walked in, i was greeted by the sales lady. i looked around for some tshirts and dresses but i didnt find anything that attractive un there."
5-star,1,"unique & quality plus size clothing for women! a great variety of everyday and special occasion items! wonderful style and beautifully curated! check this place out, it's the best locally owned plus size shop i have ever been to. zoe and her staff are knowledgable and friendly. they will give you honest opinions and help style you to perfection!"
5-star,1,"zoe at z bella has a great selection of outfits - dressy and casual. as a plus-sized woman who loves fashion, i am always able to find a great outfit (or three) at z bella's!"
5-star,1,"great option for full figured ladies. there is a great variety of clothing - casual, workout gear, business and evening. i get many compliments from others when i wear the clothing i have purchased from z bella. staff is very knowledgeable and they help customers review different clothing options but they are not pressuring. they have sales on a regular basis and frequently post on their facebook page. i have known about the store for about a year and i stop in about once a month to see what's new."
5-star,1,"i absolutely love this store. the customer service is fantastic. it is a positive atmosphere. i like how roomy and comfortable the fitting rooms are. i have been to the store twice and the staff are very attentive and kind. it is a bit pricey, but i am ok with that, because i really want to support this local business, and you can tell the clothes are high quality. i look forward to many more shopping excursions here."
5-star,1,"this store is fabulous! it caters to the 12 and up size women, real women :) and the selection is great! zoe the owner is very helpful and just great. the selection of clothing is truly wonderful, it is wonderful to find something new! i bought a pair of pants that are just amazing and i suggest you go to this boutique and check it out!! i purchased some tanks (they are so comfortable) the fabric is amazing and the cost is great! you will be happy you took the time to visit this boutique, it is so nice to have some place other than lane bryant and the cheesy department store to shop in for a size 12 and up women! i have no doubt you will find something amazing."
5-star,1,"stopped in tonight to find a dress for some upcoming social events and i have to say this place is an absolute gem! zoe the owner was super helpful. when she greeted me we chatted for a bit about budget, sizing issues, and types of events. she really made finding the perfect dress a painless experience, which for someone like me whose hips and bust aren't the same size can really be a challenge! took a little time to browse around the store after i found the dress, the selection of every day casual and dressy office type clothing is great too. buttery soft leggings and jeans... super cosy looking sweaters...flowy tops and pretty blouses... i could go on i'm already planning to stop in again as soon as i have a little money to spoil myself with! seriously, ladies size 12 and up, if you're looking for a great place to buy fashionable clothes in madison other than lane bryant; this is your store!"
5-star,1,"great selection of clothing. they run some pretty good sales as well. been on multiple occasions and your staff is wonderful. particularly chris. he went above and beyond to help me and my husband find the styles we were looking for, for our son. he's friendly, polite and very professional. his personality is a great asset to the store."
5-star,1,"the staff here are amazingggggggg! best retail store i've ever shopped at! the guys are all super friendly and helpful! today i came in to shop for my boyfriend for his birthday and the guys were super eager and willing to help! literally walked me around and showed me so many things and gave such great advice! this isn't the first time i've been shown such great customer service, its every time i've ever been in i've just yet to write a review! and if you're someone that likes to shop on your own, don't worry, they're all super chill, not pushy like most retail store workers... just know help is there if you need it. thanks guys for helping me spoil my boyfriend he's gonna go nuts! love this place!"
5-star,1,"these guys are so laid back here and allow you to feel like you're not being hounded by a sales person. but, they are so efficient and willing to help when needed. valentino really went out of his way to help me when a sizing issue occurred with my sons shoes. i will bring shopping at this zumiez more often with my teens. thanks again for the 110% you gave to our shopping experience."
1-star,0,"i was disappointed that they wouldn't return a shirt or at least give me store credit. i bought it the day before. i hadn't worn it i only removed the tags and they said that it looked worn. i've spent thousands of dollars in that store, now i won't be back."
1-star,0,"can j give less stars??? if you can't open the register, why open? why open the doors if no sale can be made or returns? just to let people look at what they can't buy? horrible service in the last 2 days and if i ever set foot in this place again, it would be too soon."
4-star,1,"we love this place and the staff! mick and kat rule. we bring our dog here! super friendly people and fun shopping environment. i like their selection of boards, shoes and accessories. we stop by once a week."
1-star,0,playing repulsive music containing words and images that made me want to run from the store. i was told this is what their shoppers like to listen to. not me. never again and i'll warn my friends.
1-star,0,"came in and asked for a certain shoe in size 6 - 7 1/2. the girl working there today responded ""we only have adult sizes"". i have never been so insulted in my life."
1-star,0,"terrible customer service. if u believe those people who gave five star and saying excellent service, u would regret for what you see. there's not even a place for you to seat or rest. those employees will not even greet with you. if you wanna have a wonderful diy shopping day, go for it. abercrombie could be a great choice for you, just do not imagine for any service in this shop."
4-star,1,"god, i'd never thought i'd see the day when i'd be favourably reviewing an abercrombie and fitch. sixteen year old me is slowly drawing out a gun ... honestly though, the quality and range of clothing here is really good. as a european, i get a bit giddy coming into chains like a&f and hollister in canada, as the import costs are so much less here than at home, and this is reflected in the prices. yay! i wouldn't have even thought of reviewing this place (even though i'm delighted with my new jeans), but the staff were so lovely i feel compelled to spread the word. everyone was so helpful and polite, especially the girl in the dressing room, who kept apologising *unprompted) for the busy crowds and who went out of her way to help me with sizing. there just seemed to be a really good atmosphere in the store, and i felt the friendliness of the staff was genuine - i definitely don't get that vibe in hollister. they definitely need more changing rooms though. there's a reason i came here to shop at 5pm on a thursday instead of on a saturday afternoon. this location at the weekends is a madhouse!!! oh and yes, the smell of perfume/cologne is overkill. i can still smell it on my hands after leaving the store two hours ago - no joke. it's actually a bit nauseating walking into the store and being hit with such a strong smell!!"
1-star,0,"they keep shooting themselves in the foot. apology after apology. time to get their marketing chops on, and find a niche that is designed to be successful."
1-star,0,"extremely dark., so dark you can't see the outrageous prices properly. unbearable cologne. the smell is so strong, you'll smell faintly like it after you walk out. atrocious service. most employees have enormous egos and interaction with them is very uncomfortable. half-hour waits for the change room during a sale. the only thing that can make this location even worse is to have naked models standing in front of the store."
1-star,0,"this place is dark, loud, and filled with enough perfume/cologne to make me go home with a headache. really, its so dark that i can't get a good look at the clothing they are trying to sell me. plus, theres a bench or couch outside (can't remember) that is a constant hangout for 13 year olds - making it hard to enter or exit the store. it was one of those ""oh, cool, a new store, lets check it out!"" and after entering i immediately pulled a 180 and left. i'll be staying far, far away."
1-star,0,"if you ever wanted proof that sex sells just look at abercrombie & fitch. sex is thrown at you from the moment you enter the store. the store and clothes reek of a&f cologne/perfume to get rid of that child labor smell. the quality and originality of the clothes is poor, but you'll pay through the ass for it. they mass produce the same style each season, how many times have you seen 'a&f' stitched in white fabric over a brightly colored top? men's tee's are designed to give the impression you are muscular; they make extra fabric in the underarms to give the illusion of ""stretch"" over your pecs and the sleeves are cut so close to the neckline to give the illusion of big shoulders. the employees are the worst, they act like being hired by a&f gives them the right to have a 'better than you' attitude. i'm convinced that it's a prerequisite for male employees to use anabolic steroids and female employees must have an eating disorder. they're not even hired to work, they're hired to sell the image of a&f. i find it hypocritical that lots of jock homophobes wear a&f yet it's a giant gay club; giant murals of half naked men are thrown in your face, the loud techno beats and overly muscular employees. when i enter the store i'm expecting to see cher start performing."
